Specifically, he challenged the denial of his motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When officers arrived at a probationer's home to serve a probation arrest warrant, they conducted a cursory search of the home. The officers noticed a chemical-type odor coming from a large trunk-like box in the living room. They opened the trunk and found items consistent with manufacturing methamphetamine. A search warrant was obtained, and defendant, the probationer's boyfriend, was charged with several crimes. He was convicted after a motion to suppress evidence was denied. In affirming, the appellate court determined that defendant's search and seizure rights under the Fourth Amendment were not violated due to the probationary search. The probationer had a diminished expectation of privacy; therefore, it was proper to allow for warrantless searches as a condition of probation. Next, a probation search was authorized since there was a reasonable suspicion that the probationer, who was subject to a probation search, was engaged in criminal activity. The scope of such extended to property that the officers had a reasonable suspicion were owned, controlled, or possessed by the probationer. This evidence was properly seized against defendant because he lived at the residence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of an order from respondent, the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona), which denied his motion for a court-ordered deposition of a child's mother after petitioner was charged with abusing the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A three-year-old child was treated at a hospital for bruising around his eyes. Petitioner was indicted for one count of child abuse for allegedly choking or strangling the child. The State listed the child's mother as a material witness. She was the only witness that would testify that petitioner inflicted the injury. Counsel for petitioner requested an interview with the mother. The mother refused based on the Victims' Bill of Rights and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4433(H) (Supp. 2006). Petitioner's counsel moved for a court-ordered deposition of the mother. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 13-4433(H) allowed a minor victim's parent or legal guardian who exercised victims' rights on behalf of the minor to also exercise all victims' rights specified in &sect; 13-4433 on the parent or legal guardian's own behalf. That included the right to refuse an interview on the parent or legal guardian's own behalf, not just on behalf of the minor child. Further, &sect; 13-4433(H) was a valid exercise of the authority granted to the legislature by the Victims' Bill of Rights under Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 2.1(D).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff guardian ad litem filed an action on plaintiff minor's behalf to recover for injuries and for the medical expenses. The suit alleged that defendant grandparents, defendant neighbors, and defendant mother were negligent. The Maricopa County Superior Court, Arizona, granted summary judgment to the grandparents. On remand, judgment was entered against the grandparents. The guardian ad litem appealed on behalf of the minor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents' children cut a hole in the fence between their property and that of their neighbors, who owned a horse on the adjoining property. On the day of the incident, the mother went inside briefly and when she returned, she could not immediately locate the minor. She discovered that the minor had climbed through the hole and had been kicked in the head by the neighbors' horse. The issue on appeal was whether the claim for medical expenses in this case belonged to the minor's parents and was therefore barred by the two-year statute of limitations, or whether the minor could pursue the claim, and, if so, whether the statute of limitations was tolled pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-502. In sum, the minor urged that a new rule be crafted recognizing that if parents waived their claim to medical expenses by not bringing it within the two-year statutory period, the claim passed to the minor. In this case, the minor did not have a right to a claim for medical expenses unless his parents consented. Because there was no evidence that the minor's parents consented, he had no rights that could be abrogated. The minor could not recover for the cost of medical care he received.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee asserted a workers' compensation claim against respondent insurer, which was accepted for benefits. After an accident, the employee petitioned to reopen his claim. An administrative law judge (ALJ) denied the petition to reopen, but awarded additional supportive medical maintenance benefits. The employee brought a statutory special action against the insurer and respondent Industrial Commission of Arizona.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee injured his back, was awarded benefits, and underwent diskectomy surgery. The employee subsequently suffered an industrial motor vehicle accident in 2004 and had a spinal cord stimulator implanted. The ALJ determined that the employee had failed to demonstrate objective physical findings of a change in his condition as required by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1061(H). The employee argued that the objective physical findings requirement under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1061(H) was unconstitutional as applied to his case under Ariz. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 8. The court rejected the employee's argument because subjective pain was not an injury within the meaning of Ariz. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 8, and, therefore, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1061(H) did not unconstitutionally eliminate it as a type of compensable injury. The objective physical findings requirement of &sect; 23-1061(H) did not address either legal or medical causation. That requirement instead made clear that subjective pain alone could not support a petition to reopen a claim. Rather, subjective pain had to directly relate to the degree of impairment resulting from an objective physical change.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a special action petition challenging the constitutionality of provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 21-202 (Supp. 2006), allowing prospective jurors 75 and older to opt out of jury service and prohibiting the public disclosure of statements submitted by prospective jurors asking to be excused from service for mental or physical reasons. The Maricopa County Superior Court, Arizona, denied relief. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who had been cited for violating various state criminal statutes, argued that the opt-out provision set out in &sect; 21-202(C) for prospective jurors 75 and older, violated his Arizona constitutional rights to due process and a fair jury trial. The court concluded that &sect; 21-202(C) did not violate the due process and fail-jury-trial provisions of the Arizona Constitution. Appellant presented no evidence that citizens 75 or over constituted a distinct group, such that allowing them to opt out of jury service would deprive a criminal defendant of the commonsense judgment of the community, would give rise to the appearance of unfairness, or would interfere with the responsibility and right all Americans share in ensuring the fair administration of justice. The court also concluded that the confidentiality provision set forth in &sect; 21-202(B)(1)(c) did not violate the open courts requirement of Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 11. The legislature's decision to maintain the confidentiality of medical statements submitted by prospective jurors did not infringe the constitutional requirement of public judicial proceedings; rather, it accommodated legitimate personal privacy rights.</SPAN></P>

The officer sought to revoke defendant's probation, and defendant was separately charged with possession of firearms by a prohibited possessor. The State of Arizona appealed after the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) granted defendant's suppression motion and barred the evidence from being used at defendant's trial on the firearms possession charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was required, as a condition of his probation, to submit to polygraph examinations as part of his post-conviction assessment and treatment program.

The officer conducted the search after the examiner told him that defendant admitted that firearms were present in his home. At the suppression hearing, the superior court excluded evidence showing that defendant had received Miranda warnings prior to the pretest. It ruled that defendant's responses to the mandated polygraph examination were involuntary statements that could not be used against him, either to justify the search or to support the admission of the firearms evidence. The court found reversible error. The officer was not required to provide Miranda warnings because defendant was not in police custody during the examination. There was no evidence that defendant was threatened or otherwise compelled to answer the examiner's incriminating question. He had waived his U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother and appellant father brought a wrongful death action against appellee school district. The Superior Court of Pima County, Arizona, held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-807 applied and evidence of the mother's guilty plea to misdemeanor child abuse could be entered into evidence. The mother and the father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' 14-month-old child was struck and killed by a school bus. The mother entered a guilty plea to a misdemeanor child abuse charge for not noticing that the child had left the house unsupervised. The parents argued the trial court erred by applying Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-807, applying collateral estoppel (issue preclusion), and admitting evidence of the guilty plea. The appellate court held that when a criminal defendant entered a guilty plea, there was no actual litigation. In Arizona, actual litigation remained a necessary predicate to the application of issue preclusion, pursuant to supreme court authority. The trial court erred by ruling that the mother's guilty plea precluded her from contradicting any issues involved in the plea or explaining her reasons for entering the plea. As to the application of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-807, which the appellate court reviewed de novo, that statute only applied if a criminal defendant was a civil defendant in a subsequent suit. The trial court erred in applying the statute. Finally, Ariz. R. Evid. 403, allowing exclusion of evidence that would waste time or confuse the jury, could not justify the trial court's broad ruling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grand jury indicted defendant for (1) conflict of interest in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-504(B); (2) conflict of interest by attempting to secure a valuable benefit in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-504(C) (2001); and (3) obstructing a criminal investigation in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2409 (2001). Defendant was convicted, before the Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, of violating &sect; 38-504(C). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant served as a county assessor. Arizona enacted the Senior Property Valuation Protection Act, also known as Proposition 104. Proposition 104 was designed to protect low-income seniors from ever-rising property valuations. To obtain a tax freeze, a homeowner was required to submit an application with supporting documentation. Materials had indicated that this information would either be kept partially or totally confidential. Defendant took this information and provided it to a mortgage company to be used in a marketing campaign targeting seniors. On appeal, defendant argued that taking and using publicly available information from his own agency for his own business purposes could not be considered using his position to secure any valuable thing or valuable benefit that was of such character as to manifest a substantial and improper influence. The appellate court agreed. A criminal violation of &sect; 38-504(C) had to be based on a duty applicable to the particular public officer with respect to his office. In this case, to the extent defendant had an obligation not to take the information, the obligation did not arise from being the assessor but from the public records law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate sued defendant County and sheriff, challenging a prison policy that required a court order before transporting an inmate to receive an elective abortion. The Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) entered judgment in favor of the inmate and permanently enjoined the county from enforcing the policy insofar as it applied to an inmate seeking an abortion. The county timely appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The policy represented an exaggerated response to the county's proffered penological concerns and was invalid insofar as it applied to transportation for abortion services. Specifically, there was no evidence that transporting an inmate for an elective abortion increased the risk of a security breach, the financial impact was minimal given the requirement that the inmate reimburse the county for security and transportation costs, and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-820.02(A)(2) (2003) exempted the county from liability for injuries caused by an escaped or escaping prisoner. Moreover, the policy did not help the county avoid violating Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 35-196.02 (2000) as the county expended no public funds for abortion procedures. Alternative means were not available as courts could effectively act as gatekeepers with the ability to overrule an inmate's choice to have an abortion. In addition, accommodating inmates' abortion rights had a de minimis financial impact on the county's jail facilities given that the inmate bore the expense. Finally, there was an alternative to the policy, i.e., administrative consideration of an inmate's request.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charge defendant faced was based solely on his having knowingly possessed a deadly weapon, while serving a term of probation on his misdemeanor domestic violence conviction. The justice court ultimately vacated the underlying conviction on constitutional grounds before this case went to trial. Defendant argued that a prior conviction, used as an element for a new offense, could not be satisfied by an underlying conviction that was constitutionally infirm. Defendant suggested that relief should be granted under Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 4. The appellate court rejected that argument for two reasons. First, defendant failed to adequately develop the argument. Second, the one case defendant cited was inapposite, and pertinent Arizona case law refuted defendant's position. Defendant's status offense fell within Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3101(A)(6)(d), not Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3101(A)(6)(b). The appellate court agreed with the State that the prohibited possessor charge was essentially a status offense, and at the time of his arrest, defendant was bound by his as yet unchallenged guilty plea in justice court and by the probation imposed as a result of the plea.</SPAN></P>

In vacating the superior court's decision, the appellate court determined that the amended definition of &quot;criminal offense&quot; under Ariz. Rev.

The Arizona Legislature's power to enact statutes was subject to any limitations imposed by a constitutional provision. It was not allowed to eliminate or reduce the rights otherwise guaranteed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant university students sought review of a decision of the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona), which dismissed the students' complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against appellees, the state legislature and the Arizona Board of Regents. The students alleged that a decision to raise tuition by almost 40% violated Ariz. Const. art. 11, &sect;&sect; 6, 10. The trial court found that appellees were immune from suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court agreed that the legislature was immune but reversed the finding as to the Board. The plain language of Ariz. Const. art. 11, &sect; 10 did not require the legislature to increase its appropriation to the university system or to keep tuition &quot;as nearly free as possible.&quot; The implementing provision of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-1661 set the base amount for maintenance of universities. The legislature in setting the annual appropriation exercised its &quot;power of the purse,&quot; a legislative function for which it was generally immune from judicial review. There was no indication in the complaint that the legislature did not minimally fund the university system as constitutionally required. However, the Board's authority to set tuition was not unlimited under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-1626(A)(5) and could violate Ariz. Const. art. 11, &sect; 6, if the rate were found to be excessive or other than reasonable. Further, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-820.01 did not preclude actions for declaratory or injunctive relief. The court could not say as a matter of law that the complaint alleging a constitutional violation against the Board did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision dismissing the students' claims against the legislature but reversed the trial court's decision finding that the Board was immune.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1423.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the evidence was a sentencing enhancement factor rather than an element of violent sexual assault and was prejudicial under Ariz. R. Evid. 403. The court accepted jurisdiction and vacated the trial court's ruling. The trial court improperly precluded the State from introducing evidence of the prior conviction. The court found that the text of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1423 and the legislative history plainly established the crime of violent sexual assault and that a historical prior felony conviction for a sexual offense was an element of that crime, rather than merely a sentence enhancement. Thus, Ariz. R. Crim. P. 19 had no application because the prior conviction was an element of the offense. The court rejected the argument that allowing the evidence was an unconstitutional encroachment on judicial rule-making authority under Ariz. R. Evid. 403 because the state supreme court had held that evidence establishing an element of the offense could not be kept from the jury.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-702(D) and that the state's sentencing scheme was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the fact that the lower court found only mitigating factors and still imposed the presumptive sentence was of no moment unless, in evaluating the amount and substance of the mitigating factors, it abused its considerable discretion in doing so. There was no such abuse of discretion in this case. Although the court was required by &sect; 13-702(D)(2) to consider the defendant's impaired capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions and to conform his conduct to the law, it was permitted to find that a presumptive term was nevertheless appropriate. The lower court considered the defendant's individual circumstances and imposed a sentence well within its discretion based on the crime and the defendant's criminal history. The defendant failed to explain how &sect; 13-702(D) violated due process, and the appellate court was unable to envision why it would, so it declined to find Arizona's sentencing scheme unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fire district adopted a resolution to impose a facilities benefit assessment on homes not yet constructed. Appellee construction company refused to pay the assessments on homes they were building, and the district brought an action to force the company to pay the assessment. The Superior Court of Pima County, Arizona, granted summary judgment in favor of the company. The district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the fire district contended summary judgment in favor of the construction company was improper. The appellate court agreed, finding first that the district properly characterized its facilities benefit assessment as a fee to help pay for the costs of developing facilities from which to provide services to new building construction areas. Whether such assessments were similar in nature to development fees or not, the legislature intended to authorize those assessments when it promulgated Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-805(B)(14). Because the legislature specifically considered the scope of &sect; 48-805(B)(14) and did not exclude owners in the process of constructing a home, the appellate court rejected the company's contention that the legislature could not have intended to authorize the district to assess fees against it. Further, the assessment was not a tax as it would not be used to benefit the entire community but, rather, to develop facilities or other resources designed to benefit both those in the process of building homes and those who eventually purchased those homes. Thus, it would be used for the regulation or benefit of the parties upon whom the assessment was imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder and other offenses. Defendant maintained that, based on Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703.01 and Ariz. R. Crim. P. 19.1(c), he was entitled to a full and fair aggravation resentencing proceeding. The State asserted that, because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(1) factor was exempt from certain requirements and because the inmate had conceded in his appeal that a resentencing on the (F)(1) factor was not required, the jury did not need to determine whether any aggravating circumstances existed. One factor, the State argued, rendered the inmate death eligible, although a jury was required to impose the death penalty in a felony-murder matter. Arizona's amended statutes required the trier of fact to find whether any aggravating circumstances alleged under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F) existed and whether to impose the death penalty. Nothing in the new statutory scheme permitted a trial judge to direct a verdict against a defendant on alleged aggravating circumstances based on evidence presented at trial. The appellate court found that the judge proceeded or was threatening to proceed without or in excess of jurisdiction or legal authority.</SPAN></P>

IV, pt. 1, &sect; 1(3), applied to criminal defendants such as petitioner, who allegedly committed first-degree murder before the effective date of the statute but whose case was yet to be tried.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged in 2004. In accordance with the version of &sect; 13-205 then in effect, justification defenses were affirmative defenses that a defendant had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence. In 2006, the legislature amended the language of &sect; 13-205 to exclude justification defenses from among the affirmative defenses that could be raised in a criminal action. Respondent judge denied petitioner's motion to instruct the jury in accordance with the current version of the statute. On review, the court first stated that special action jurisdiction was appropriate. It then determined that the legislature intended the statute to apply to pending cases that had not yet gone to trial. Although the court viewed that as a prospective application of the statute, even assuming it could be construed retroactively when applied to defendants who committed offenses before the amendment's effective date, the court found no constitutional or statutory impediment to such an application. Therefore, the court held that &sect; 13-205 applied to defendants like petitioner who allegedly committed offenses before the effective date of the amendment but who had not yet been tried.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court accepted special action jurisdiction and granted relief by reversing that portion of the judge's order that essentially found &sect; 13-205 inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

On review of the trial court's order requiring the county attorney to reinstate the plea offers, the court held that defendant was deprived of effective assistance of counsel when she failed to communicate the plea offers to him. However, the trial court exceeded its authority and violated separation of powers principles under Ariz. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that the legislation, which allowed the county island residents to create a county island fire district to obtain fire and emergency services, violated Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect; 19, and granted the town injunctive relief. The residents argued that HB 2145 did not violate the Arizona Constitution. The appellate court noted that the town had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the legislation because if the fire district could not secure a private provider, the town remained responsible for providing the services. There was clearly a legitimate governmental objective - to provide fire and emergency services to the county island residents. The population classification was rationally related to the legislative's objective of providing fire and emergency services to those in need. The legislature failed to include the county island residents of other towns who were similarly situated but did not have the ability to create their own county island fire district. The remote possibility of only one other entity being able to enter the class in the next 19 years was insufficient to satisfy the third prong of elasticity.</SPAN></P>

The union appealed; the city cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union argued that the superior court erred in finding that its &quot;fair share&quot; proposals were illegal under Arizona law; violated the city's &quot;meet and confer&quot; ordinance; and, even if legal, were a permissive rather than mandatory subject of collective bargaining. The appellate court determined that the clear intent of the electorate of Arizona in enacting Ariz. Const. art. 25 and Arizona's &quot;right to work&quot; laws was to ensure the freedom of workers to choose whether to join and participate in a union. Allowing the proposed &quot;fair share&quot; fee would be contrary to that intent as it would render meaningless the distinction between union membership and non-membership. The fact that the union's proposed &quot;fair share&quot; fee may be less than the amount of full union dues was a distinction without a difference; it was the compulsion and not the amount that was important. Because the &quot;fair share&quot; proposals were illegal, the appellate court did not need to decide the other issues raised by the union or by the city in its cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual owned property in a City-designated redevelopment area. A city zoning ordinance prohibited &quot;outdoor advertising&quot; structures in any designated redevelopment area. In 1999, the individual began efforts to construct a &quot;media sculpture&quot; on the site. The city opposed the project as it believed the project was &quot;outdoor advertising.&quot; The individual then proposed building a two-story 900 square foot glass structure that would house a television broadcast station and four video screens, each 16' x 12', set back at least 6'1&quot; from the structure's inside windows. The city placed a hold on the individual's building permit application because the video screens constituted off-site advertising. After revising the project again, the Zoning Board of Adjustment approved the project. The city moved the Board to rehear the matter; the Board did so and disapproved the project.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An alleged shoplifter was asphyxiated during his apprehension by store security guards. The spouse filed a wrongful death action, and a motion for summary judgment was filed based on Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-712(B). The trial judge denied the motion, and the special action was filed challenging the ruling. In denying relief, the court determined that the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk were for the jury to decide, pursuant to Ariz. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 5. The spouse argued that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-712(B) violated this constitutional prohibition because it provided that the antecedent conduct of a person injured was an absolute bar to the recovery of damages from one that was otherwise liable for the injury under either statutory or common law principals. Under the common law and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1805, a defendant had a duty to act reasonably in response to criminal conduct, and unreasonable, excessive use of force could have resulted in liability. Therefore, Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant unsuccessfully sought a real estate sales license. A hearing was conducted, but the decision was upheld, and this was affirmed on review. The applicant then filed an appeal. On review, the appellate court determined that the superior court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to change venue under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-406 (2003). The convenience of witnesses was not an issue because the applicant was not entitled to a trial de novo. In addition, the location of the hearing was not unreasonable since the applicant could have offered testimony via telephone. His due process rights were not violated since he had notice and an opportunity to be heard. The applicant also showed no equal protection violation since there he was not treated differently, and the agency had a legitimate interest in holding the hearing near its location. A denial under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-2153(B)(2) (Supp. 2005) was proper because the applicant's drug/alcohol crimes were reasonably related to the function of a real estate salesman, and they indicated a lack of good character under &sect; 32-2153(B)(7).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the city's prostitution ordinance, Phoenix, Ariz., City Code &sect; 23-52(A)(2), violated his fundamental constitutional right to engage in adult consensual sexual conduct in light of the United States Supreme Court's holding in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2003), and that the appellate filing fees imposed by the municipal court violated the rights of the accused guaranteed by Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 24. The court held that the prostitution ordinance was constitutional because the liberty interest accorded to homosexuals in Lawrence did not extend to all private consensual sexual activity, and the Supreme Court had expressly stated that its holding did not reach other forms of sexual activity, including public conduct and prostitution. The court also found that Arizona courts had never recognized any constitutionally protected fundamental liberty or privacy interest in engaging in commercial sexual activity, even in private. The court held that the municipal court's assessment of the fee violated Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-373 (2002) and Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 24, which prohibited the collection of a fee from a defendant to pursue a criminal appeal.</SPAN></P>

However, the court held that the municipal court's assessment of fees to appeal a criminal conviction was not legal, and directed the court to refund the fees to defendant.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the trial court entered judgment for the county on the owners' remaining claims that they were entitled to notice of the county supervisor board's general meeting, in which the owners alleged the board decided to down zone a parcel that was between their two parcels. The zoning commission had denied their applications to rezone their two parcels from ranch suburban use to other uses, and interested citizens requested that the parcel between their two parcels be down zoned from business to suburban use. The court found that the county had complied with the public notice and hearing provisions as well as the jurisdictional requirements in Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that the owners failed to refute the city's plainly legitimate justification for the city ordinance that made the operation of a live sex act business illegal in the city. The city claimed that its regulatory prohibition of live sex act clubs as public nuisances was not a constitutional taking of property for which the owners were entitled to receive just compensation. The appellate court agreed with the city that the trial court should have ruled on the city's nuisance exception defense as a threshold matter before reaching the Penn Central analysis. The conduct proscribed by Phoenix, Ariz., Ordinance No. G-4145 (Ordinance) could have been prohibited as a common-law public nuisance and a public health hazard. Because the Ordinance did not proscribe a productive use that was previously permissible under relevant nuisance laws, live sex acts fell within the nuisance exception to the Takings Clause. Although the city did license sexually oriented businesses, the owners would not have qualified because that license applied only to adult arcades, cabarets, adult motels and adult theaters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had adopted four ordinances that adjusted its utility rates. The political committee filed an application for a referendum petition to refer the ordinances for voter approval. The trial court held that utility rate making was an administrative act that was not subject to referendum. The political committee argued that the ordinances were legislative acts that were referable because the city passed them to implement a general tax increase, that the city's charter made the referendum applicable to increased utility rates, and that other states had found that setting utility rates was a legislative action subject to the referendum power. The appellate court noted that the city's use of revenues from its utility services to offset other costs of governing did not automatically convert utility rates into a tax and that the city's charter empowered it to enact ordinances to regulate rates charged by public utilities and to fix rates for city-owned utilities. The appellate court held that there were no Arizona statutory or constitutional provisions which conflicted with deciding that municipal rate increases were administrative acts that were not subject to referendum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, before the Superior Court of Pima County, Arizona, of continuous sexual abuse of a child in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1417. Defendant appealed the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's daughter, who was 12 years old, accused him of unlawfully touching her; the touching took place over several years. Defendant maintained he did not receive adequate notice of the alleged misconduct to enable him to defend against the charge. Defendant failed to articulate how his defense was impaired or prejudiced. Further, there was no violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause because defendant's acts constituted a continuous course of conduct. Next, defendant contended that the instruction was a constitutionally defective jury instruction that violated the unanimity requirement. The appellate court examined whether the three or more acts in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-1405, 13-1406 or 13-1410, as required by &sect; 13-1417, constituted elements of the offense or were merely the means by or the manner in which one committed the crime of continuous sexual abuse of a child. The appellate court concluded that &sect; 13-1417 did not violate the Arizona constitutional requirement of jury unanimity.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-533(B)(3) on the grounds of chronic substance abuse and the duration of the children's court-ordered, out-of-home placement pursuant to &sect; 8-533(B)(8)(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the juvenile court granted summary judgment based on erroneous factual findings and legal conclusions. ADES's own documents in support of summary judgment invited the court to make credibility determinations and established that the parties' versions of material facts differed. Despite deficiencies in form, the appellate court found that the mother's opposition, when coupled with questions of fact raised by some of ADES's own documents, sufficiently demonstrated the existence of genuine, material factual disputes, and the appellate court disagreed with the juvenile court's apparent conclusion that the &quot;quantum of evidence&quot; was so slight as to justify denying the mother a trial. Though the mother might have been unlikely to prevail at trial, ADES was not entitled to summary judgment because material issues of fact could not be resolved without credibility determinations and weighing of evidence, matters peculiarly and exclusively for a trier of fact. A reasonable trier of fact could have determined that ADES failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that grounds existed to terminate the mother's parental rights pursuant to &sect; 8-533(B)(3) or (B)(8)(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A physician at the clinic harvested eggs from the wife and fertilized them with the husband's sperm. When plaintiffs had the pre-embryos transferred to another clinic, some were missing. The trial court held that plaintiffs failed to state a claim. The court affirmed the dismissal on the wrongful death claim under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-611 because the absence of this prerequisite to &quot;personhood&quot; supported a conclusion that pre-implantation fertilized human eggs were not &quot;persons&quot; for purposes of &sect; 12-611. The court declined to expand the definition of &quot;viability&quot; to a point of &quot;potential viability.&quot; Such a decision was best left to elected representatives subject to constitutional restraints. However, the court held that plaintiffs could sue for the negligent loss of their pre-embryos and that it was premature for the superior court to hold that the medical malpractice act barred the claim for breach of fiduciary duty. The act did not shield health care providers from all other negligence actions. If the claim was grounded in the clinic's negligent storage by non-health care personnel, it was arguably not a medical malpractice action under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-562(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's dismissal of the wrongful death claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the juvenile court erred in sentencing her under the general contempt provisions in Ariz.

The appellate court concluded that the legislature did not intend to permit juvenile courts to employ the contempt sanctions in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-863 when addressing the willful violation of court orders issued pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-234. The legislature intended to alter the maximum punishment available for the contempt addressed in &sect; 8-234 from that addressed in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-863. Section 8-234 was the more specific of the two provisions. It created the duty that the mother breached and authorized the court's order that the mother later violated. The legislature did not intend to provide superior courts the option of choosing between the two statutes. The appellate court's conclusion that the juvenile court erred by not proceeding under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-234 rendered any deficiencies in trial counsel's understanding of his client's rights pursuant to Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a redistricting commission, a group, and several intervenors, challenged a decision of the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona), which ordered the commission to formulate various definitions and standards after finding that a legislative plan did not sufficiently favor competitive voting districts in an action filed by appellees, a coalition state senators and others (coalition), challenging the plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the trial court correctly ruled on constitutional challenges to new voting districts. The trial court utilized the strict scrutiny standard in deciding the equal protection challenges. The court held that there had been no unconstitutional identification of or discrimination against a suspect class warranting strict scrutiny review because the redistricting plans did not impose &quot;severe&quot; restrictions that substantially burdened the right to vote. Further, the coalition did not demonstrate that equal protection principles demanded definitions to prevent the commission from discriminating against some voters. The trial court also erred by ruling that creation of competitive districts was no less important than other goals in Ariz. Const. art. IV, pt. 2, &sect; 1(14)(B) - (E) and that the commission erred in treating competitiveness as a subordinate goal. Also, mere knowledge of the specific residence of an incumbent, without the use of such knowledge to draw boundary lines, could not render a plan unconstitutional. Moreover, it was error to rule that the act of designating a consultant as an expert witness permanently waived the legislative privilege.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the judgment that invalidated the redistricting plan and ordered the commission to construct a new plan. The court affirmed the portion of the judgment granting summary judgment against a Native-American nation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Cochise County (Arizona) that denied the hospital's motion and granted appellee doctor's motion for summary judgment in his appeal of a decision of the hospital's Governing Board that accepted the recommendation of the Appellate Review Committee (ARC) and Medical Staff Executive Committee (MSEC) to revoke the doctor's hospital privileges based on the quality of care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the doctor was entitled to injunctive relief because there were four procedural defects in the hospital's revocation proceeding and there were no issues of material fact as to the violations. The hospital argued that the trial court was required by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-445.02(B) to affirm the decision revoking the doctor's privileges, despite procedural errors, because it was based on substantial evidence. The court rejected the hospital's argument and concluded that &sect; 36-445.02(B) permitted the doctor to bring an action for injunctive relief seeking to correct an erroneous decision or procedure. However the court held that the trial court erred in granting the doctor's motion for summary judgment because there were questions of fact as to whether procedural defects occurred. The court noted that there was no requirement that the hearing officer make recommendations, that the doctor failed to establish bias on the part of an ARC member or that his dual role on the MSEC and ARC constituted an automatic due process violation, and that the bylaws did not prohibit an ARC member from serving on both the MSEC and the Governing Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the hospital's motion for summary judgment, but reversed the grant of the doctor's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that factual issues precluded summary judgment. The court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The State filed notice that it would request the death penalty, and indicated that it might offer testimony of the victim's representative during any sentencing aggravation and penalty phases. Defendant unsuccessfully moved to preclude introduction of victim impact evidence, and requested the trial court to declare Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4426.01&nbsp;unconstitutional. The trial court agreed and found that the statute conflicted with the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The appellate court ruled that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4426.01 was facially constitutional, and it was premature to evaluate the application of the statute to the facts. The statute afforded the victim's representative a right to present an impact statement to rebut any mitigation evidence at any sentencing penalty phase without disclosing that statement. Defendant did not make any showing that victim impact information existed, or that it would be necessary during the trial or in any sentencing aggravation phase. The trial court erred in determining that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) terminated appellant mother's parental rights to her child after her older child had been abused and murdered by the mother's boyfriend. The court impliedly adopted the interpretation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-533(B)(2) that justified termination if &quot;a child&quot; was abused or neglected by the parent or another and the parent knew or should have known about the abuse or neglect. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the department of economic security did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that she abused her daughter and that her boyfriend's murder of her other child should not have been considered. She also argued that the court violated her fundamental rights as a parent. The mother contended that because she did not abuse or neglect her other child, the juvenile court erred in basing its termination order on &sect; 8-533(B)(2). The deceased child was fatally abused, and the younger child was removed because of that abuse; thus the appellate court focused on whether &quot;a child&quot; in the statute meant &quot;the child&quot; who was abused or &quot;another child of the parent&quot; who was not abused. Based on the statutory language and context the court held that &sect; 8-533(B)(2) could mean that parents who abused or neglected their children, or who permitted another person to abuse or neglect their children, could have their parental rights to their other children terminated even though there was no evidence that the other children were abused or neglected. That was the very fact situation that prompted the legislature to change the statute. Thus, statutory grounds existed for termination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimed his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated when the trial court imposed aggravated sentences based on facts not proven to a jury in violation of the rule announced in Apprendi v.

Petitioner argued that he was entitled to relief because Blakely was retroactive to the date that Apprendi was decided and his convictions and sentences were not final at that time. On review, the court held that Blakely did not apply retroactively because it was a new rule of criminal procedure and did not fall within the exceptions to the rule of non-retroactivity; thus, it applied only to cases not yet final on direct review when it was decided. The court rejected the ineffective assistance of counsel claim because petitioner's aggravated sentences did not exceed the statutory maximum; thus, Apprendi did not apply and the outcome of petitioner's appeal would not have changed if the Apprendi claim had been raised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a special action proceeding, petitioner State of Arizona contended that respondent judge of the Superior Court of the State of Arizona, in and for the County of Santa Cruz, abused his discretion by finding that statements made by real party in interest criminal defendant in establishing his guilty plea to reckless manslaughter were not admissions of facts for purposes of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Blakely v. Washington.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed his mother and shot his father and brother, injuring them. Pursuant to a plea agreement, he pled guilty to reckless manslaughter in exchange for the State's dismissal of the remaining charges. Defendant established the factual basis for the plea at the change-of-plea hearing, describing what had occurred the night of the shootings. The judge deferred accepting the plea until sentencing. The State then alleged aggravating circumstances, but the judge found Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-702 and 13-702.01&nbsp;unconstitutional insofar as they permitted judges to impose a prison term based on facts in aggravation found by a judge rather than a jury.  The state sought special action relief. The court concluded that the judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that statements defendant made during the change-of-plea colloquy were not admissions of fact for purposes of Blakely, adding that defendant did not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive his right to a jury trial on the aggravating circumstances. The court found that the judge erred in ruling that the State could not prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstances it alleged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court accepted jurisdiction and granted relief in part by vacating the part of the judge's ruling that determined that the State could not prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstances it alleged. The court ruled that a judge had the authority to conduct such a trial, and the sentencing statutes could be applied in a constitutional manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge initially set bail at $ 250,000, to be paid in cash; the trial court later reduced bail to $ 50,000, to be paid in cash. Petitioner's motion to modify was denied. In his request for special action relief, petitioner argued that Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 22, Ariz. R. Crim. P. 7.2, and Ariz. R. Crim. P. 7.3 prohibited &quot;cash-only&quot; conditions of bail. The appellate court rejected this argument; it held that Arizona law did not prohibit a &quot;cash-only&quot; condition on bail. The appellate court, in its analysis, first addressed the meaning and scope of the pertinent Arizona statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3967, and rules 7.2 and 7.3. The appellate court determined the statute was clear and definitive, expressly authorizing a trial court to impose a deposit of cash as a required condition of bail. The rule of lenity did not apply because the statute was not ambiguous. Turning next to the constitutional argument, the appellate court noted that there was no basis for concluding that the drafters of the state's constitution intended to foreclose a cash-only restriction. The judge acted within his legal authority in denying the motion to set a secured appearance bond.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee sought review of a decision by respondent, the Industrial Commission of Arizona (ICA), that denied the employee's claim for temporary partial disability (TPD) benefits. The employee's TPD compensation benefit was reduced to zero due to the application of an amendment to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1044(A) that required that 50 percent of retirement benefits received during the period of TPD be considered as wages able to be earned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the amendment to &sect; 23-1044(A), the employee was forced to retire because of a work-related injury. After the amendment was enacted, the employee became eligible for TPD benefits, but the amendment reduced the employee's benefit to zero. Because the employee did not have a vested right to TPD benefits prior to the amendment, the court rejected the employee's contention that the amendment was erroneously applied retroactively. The court also determined that the amendment did not waive or assign workers' compensation benefits in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 23-1025(A) or 23-1068(A) (Supp. 2004). The court concluded that the amendment to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1044(A) violated Ariz. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 8 and was therefore void because the amendment reduced the amount of compensation to which the employee would have otherwise been entitled and the amendment was not approved by Arizona voters. Because the ICA decision was based on the application of the unconstitutional amendment, the ICA award was set aside.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, the &quot;distinct strong odor&quot; of alcohol emanating from defendant's position in the driver's seat became even stronger when he attempted to speak to the deceased front-seat passenger. The accident occurred in broad daylight when defendant crossed the centerline and collided head-on with the oncoming van.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Pima County, Arizona, convicted defendant of aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) with a suspended or revoked driver's license and one count of aggravated driving with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .08 or more with a suspended or revoked driver's license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1381 was unconstitutional and violated her due process rights. The appellate court noted that because the statute provided fair notice of what constituted a punishable BAC level, it should not be declared void for vagueness simply because it might be difficult for the public to determine how far they could go before they were in actual violation. While results from a test administered after a significant period of time or which were subject to other factors creating scientific inaccuracy may inject evidentiary problems, those were matters for the fact finder to resolve. The statute's terms were unambiguous and precise in identifying the prohibited conduct --having a BAC of .08 or higher within two hours of driving a vehicle. Defendant lacked standing to bring an overbreadth claim as she did not allege that the statute substantially infringed upon protected First Amendment freedoms or that she was a member of a class of innocent defendants. Elimination of the affirmative defense provision did not render it unconstitutional as the State was not relieved from proving that defendant's BAC was .08 or greater within two hours of driving.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner life insurance company filed a petition with the probate court to deposit disputed annuity policy benefits with the probate court. Appellant wife and appellee husband's estate filed competing claims for the annuity proceeds. The estate eventually moved for summary judgment. The Maricopa County Superior Court, Arizona, ruled in favor of the estate, but it denied the estate's attorney fee request. The parties cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband applied for an annuity, which named the wife as the beneficiary. Three years later, the wife filed a pro per petition for marital dissolution. The couple jointly filled out a section describing community property and debts. The annuity policy, however, was not addressed. The wife attempted to argue that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-2804(A) (1995) was inapplicable because the husband had made an affirmative decision to retain her as the policy's beneficiary by not removing her as the beneficiary after entry of the dissolution decree. She also asserted that she was entitled to a community property share of the proceeds pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-318(B) (Supp. 2004). The policy was not omitted property under &sect; 25-318(B). Section 25-318(B) did not apply when a decree effectuated an explicit property settlement agreement that disposed of all of the parties' marital assets. Also, the automatic revocation mandated by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-2804 (1995) could not be avoided by spousal inaction. Pursuant to &sect; 14-2804, the husband's designation of the wife as the beneficiary under the annuity policy was automatically revoked upon entry of the dissolution decree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the probate court's decision awarding the annuity proceeds to the husband's estate. The appellate court also affirmed the probate court's decision denying the estate's request for fees, but the appellate court reversed the probate court's decision denying court costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated DUI and aggravated driving with an alcohol concentration of .08 or more in his body within two hours of driving a motor vehicle. The trial court placed defendant on probation for two years on each count, to run concurrently. The trial court also sentenced defendant to four months of incarceration as a condition of probation on the first count. On appeal, defendant asserted that due process required law enforcement to provide DUI suspects their own breath samples for independent testing. The court found that the record failed to show either that defendant was totally unable to obtain a breath sample and have it tested through another source, or that any difficulties were created by the State. In support of his contention, defendant merely asserted that the manufacturer of a particular machine, the Intoxilyzer, did not sell the machine to private persons. Moreover, the record failed to show that defendant even attempted to obtain independent testing of his breath. Thus, the practical difficulty that defendant identified in obtaining an independent breath sample failed to create a due process violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed a judgment of the Arizona Tax Court that granted summary judgment in favor of defendant Arizona Department of Revenue (ADOR) and upheld the ADOR's adoption, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-14156(3) (Supp. 2004), of a 25-year valuation table for depreciating personal property at electric generation plants, and that denied the taxpayer's post-trial motion. The taxpayer owned an electric generation plant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that the ADOR should have adopted a 15-year valuation table for depreciating personal property rather than the 25-year table adopted by the ADOR. The tax court found that the ADOR did not act arbitrarily in adopting the 25-year table. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that the tax court erred by applying the arbitrary standard of review rather than a de novo standard of review. The court held that the tax court did not err by employing the arbitrary standard of review. The court noted that a valuation challenge could encompass a claim under the &quot;obsolescence provision,&quot; Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-14156(A)(4), which would have required the de novo standard of review but that the taxpayer did not raise any issues to the tax court concerning the obsolescence provision. Rather, the only issue raised by the taxpayer was the ADOR's adoption of the 25-year table. The court found that the record reflected that ADOR selected the 25-year table based on a rational basis and after due investigation and that the taxpayer presented no evidence contesting that the ADOR engaged in the investigation or disputing that the selection of the 25-year table had a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile admitted to attempted unlawful use of means of transportation, unlawful use of means of transportation, simple assault, and probation violations. The Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona entered a disposition committing appellant to the Arizona Department of Juvenile Corrections (ADJC) for a minimum of six months. Appellant challenged the disposition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to disposition in this matter, appellant had a number of referrals to juvenile court for various offenses with a range of offense levels. The juvenile court not only ordered commitment, but directed appellant to attend school, and it also ordered appellant to attend programs for substance abuse and anger management. Appellant submitted two contentions on appeal: (1) the disposition was unlawful; and (2) the commitment violated his constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Appellant contended that the juvenile court's error in attempting to direct ADJC as to the terms of confinement required the appellate court to vacate the entire disposition. The appellate court agreed that the juvenile court could not direct the ADJC to provide specific services to a juvenile during commitment. This error did not, however, invariably require that the commitment decision be vacated. The juvenile court clearly stated that the only option for appellant was commitment, a determination supported by the record. The defect in the disposition was remedied by deleting the directions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the juvenile court's disposition, as modified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of burglary in the third degree and possession of burglary tools. The Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, sentenced him to aggravated prison terms of 11 years and 4 years, respectively, to be served concurrently. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before imposing defendant's sentence, the trial court found four aggravating circumstances, including defendant's history of prior felony convictions, and one mitigating circumstance. Defendant argued that the judicial determination of aggravating circumstances denied him the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee. Because several of defendant's convictions occurred within 10 years preceding the date of his current offenses, the trial court was required, under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-702(C)(11) (2001), to consider them as aggravating factors, which exposed him to maximum sentences of 12 and 4.5 years, respectively, based solely on the facts reflected in the jury verdicts. Because the sentences imposed by the trial court did not exceed these maximums, the three additional aggravating factors were not facts legally essential to the punishment; thus, defendant had no legal right to have a jury determine their existence. Hence, the trial court did not violate defendant's jury-trial guarantee when it considered additional aggravating factors not found by the jury, weighed them against the sole mitigating circumstance, and imposed aggravated sentences within the authorized ranges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-360.07(B) required the Commission, upon a challenge to a decision of the Siting Committee concerning a certificate of environmental compatibility, to balance, in the broad public interest, the need for an adequate, economical, and reliable supply of electric power with the desire to minimize the effect on the environment and the ecology of Arizona. However, that balancing was not required in every case. It was only required when a party requested that the Commission review the Siting Committee's written decision concerning a certificate of environmental compatibility (CEC) within 15 days of its issuance. However, even if the statute did not require that the balancing occur in the present case, one of the conditions placed in the CEC itself did require the statutory balancing. But, the appellate court found that the testimony introduced at the Commission hearing constituted substantial evidence of the need for the power from the fourth unit when balanced with the desire to minimize the environmental and ecological costs to Arizona. Thus, the Commission's decision authorizing the construction of the fourth unit was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2314, and the Arizona Forfeiture Reform Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-4301 to -4315 (1999) The Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, granted a partial summary judgment and awarded attorneys' fees and costs for the State.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner moved to Arizona, where she bought a home and a restaurant. Although the property owner claimed that she had divorced her husband, the State maintained that they were still married. The property owner was functioning as a drug enterprise's banker. The complaint alleged that the property owner participated in the transfer of an organized crime family's proceeds to Arizona. The property owner claimed that the forfeiture proceedings at issue violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, U.S. Const. amend. V. The appellate court determined that the forfeiture statutes were civil in nature, not criminal. Moreover, because the forfeiture was foreseeable, it was not a violation of the Excessive Fines Clause. The double jeopardy provision of Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 10 was interpreted in a parallel manner to its federal counterpart. The appellate court further concluded that Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 16 was not violated because the forfeiture was triggered only by racketeering conduct as defined in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2301(D)(4). Finally, the award of attorneys' fees and costs was based upon the actual expenditure of government resources; therefore, it was not punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the parents' son, a security guard, was not 21 years old, and could not legally purchase a handgun himself, he asked the parents to purchase a gun for him so that he could receive an increase in pay. The mother purchased a gun for him. Despite the son's use of marijuana in the past, the mother believed that he was no longer using marijuana. Later, plaintiff and the son were smoking marijuana and the son accidentally shot plaintiff in the head. Plaintiff sued the parents, alleging they were liable for his injuries because they purchased the gun that was used in the shooting and had given it to the son, knowing he was a drug abuser. The trial court denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and granted the parents' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court found that plaintiff failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the parents knew or should have known the son was using marijuana when they purchased the gun. Plaintiff also failed to show that, at the time the parents gave the son the gun, they knew or had any reason to believe that he was an &quot;unlawful user&quot; within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 922.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers requested additional tax credits that would have been available under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1086 (repealed 2004). A hearing officer of defendant Arizona Department of Revenue (ADOR) denied the claim, the ADOR's director sustained the denial, and the taxpayers appealed. The Arizona Tax Court granted summary judgment for ADOR. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">2000 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 405 created enhanced tax credits and other benefits for persons who owned vehicles powered by alternative fuel. Taxpayers could obtain a new 100 percent tax credit for the cost of alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) conversions plus additional credits. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1086 was amended to allow a minimum $ 30,000 tax credit for the conversion of a vehicle over 12,000 pounds in weight. The taxpayers ultimately bought four used motor homes for conversion. Unforeseen costs to the state, however, forced a moratorium on the program. Nevertheless, the taxpayers filed their income tax return and received the full cash value of those tax credits. They later amended their return to request additional credits. The appellate court noted that the taxpayers failed to prove: (1) the existence of a contract, and (2) an unconstitutional impairment of that contract. The enactment of the statutes did not create a contract. Further, no due process violation occurred because the tax provisions did not create vested rights. The later version of the law, however, did allow recovery of 100 percent of costs, and it allowed the taxpayers to retain profits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said his two companions pulled a man out of his rental car and beat him; defendant and the companions drove off in the car. Before dying of his injuries, the victim told police he had been assaulted by three men who stole his car. Defendant and two other men were seen in rental car. Blood was found on defendant's shoe, on the companion's clothes, and on concrete blocks found at the murder scene. The appellate court held that, as the evidence had been sufficient to convict defendant of the crimes, the trial court properly denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal. Instructions concerning reasonable doubt and the elements of felony murder were proper. As the victim had been staggering, bleeding, slipping in and out of consciousness, and asking for medical help, the trial court properly found that he had been under the stress of a startling event; his statement was thus admissible under Ariz. R. Evid. 803(2) as an excited utterance. Since police did not know a crime had been committed when they questioned the victim, his statement was non-testimonial hearsay outside the scope of Crawford and its admission did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment confrontation rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were married in Virginia and at the time marriage between first cousins was valid in Virginia. The parties moved to Arizona where marriage between first cousins was void per Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-101. However when they moved to Arizona, the law also provided that marriages valid by the laws of the place where contracted were valid in Arizona per Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-112(A). Later, &sect; 25.112(A) was amended to add a phrase excepting marriages that were void and prohibited by Ariz. Code &sect; 25-101. The court held that under a conflict-of-law analysis of whether the out-of-state marriage was valid in Arizona did not apply Virginia law. If the plain language of the amendment were applied the legislation had a retroactive effect on the marriage. The court held that marriage was a substantive right and appellee's right to have her marriage recognized had &quot;vested.&quot; Had the legislature chosen to nullify existing marriages (thus having the retroactive effect described) it could have expressly stated so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Pima County, Arizona, convicted defendant of armed robbery, aggravated robbery, six counts of kidnapping, and six counts of aggravated assault, and sentenced him to a combination of consecutive and concurrent, presumptive and aggravated prison terms totaling 30.5 years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that the trial court violated Blakely by aggravating his sentences using factors not found by the jury. The appellate court agreed, finding that without additional findings of fact, the presumptive sentences for the aggravated robbery and dangerous nature, armed robbery convictions were 3.5 years and 10.5 years, not the aggravated sentences of 7 and 20 years the trial court imposed. The aggravated sentences, therefore, violated Blakely. Further, the appellate court could not say that a jury would have found the same aggravating factors as the trial court. The trial court's finding of &quot;significant emotional harm to multiple victims&quot; was an inherently subjective determination, and, of the five aggravating factors found, only three were among the aggravators listed in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-702(C). The appellate court could not conclude that the Blakely error was harmless and did not contribute to the sentences, particularly because, in addition to relying on the presence of accomplices, the trial court also weighed four additional aggravating factors not found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions and presumptive sentences were affirmed, but his aggravated sentences were vacated and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

There was no ambiguity in &sect; 13-901.01(B) that would permit the &quot;indicted for&quot; language to be applied solely to existing indictments. The use of the past tense &quot;has been&quot; as a modifier for the phrase &quot;convicted of or indicted for&quot; indicated a clear intent to include all prior convictions or indictments for a violent crime as disqualifying a person from the scope of &sect; 13-901.01. This statute could not constitutionally permit the fact of an indictment to serve as a disqualifying or enhancement factor for purposes of sentencing. The portion of &sect; 13-901.01(B) that disqualified an otherwise eligible defendant from mandatory probation for a drug offense based solely on a finding that she had been indicted for a violent crime was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each offense was a class 2 felony and dangerous crime against children punishable by a prison term of 10 to 24 years without the possibility of probation, early release, or pardon, and each sentence had to be served consecutively, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3553(C). Defendant was sentenced to the minimum and mitigated sentence, 20 consecutive 10-year terms of imprisonment. The legislature's designation of possession of child pornography as a more serious offense than the act of indecent exposure and its refusal to distinguish between commercial and non-commercial sexual exploitation of minors was rationally related to furthering the State's interest in protecting children. Defendant's constitutional guarantees of equal protection were not violated. Defendant claimed his sentence was disproportionate, because he was convicted of possessing child pornography, not of producing or selling it. But he supported the industry, as he provided an economic motive for its creation and continuation. There was no inference of gross disproportionality in his sentence. The federal and state constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment were not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona), which required him to submit to DNA testing. Defendant claimed that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-610(O)(1) (Supp. 2003), which authorized DNA testing of juveniles adjudicated delinquent for sexual offenses, did not apply to attempted sexual offenses and that the ordered test violated his constitutional right to privacy under the Fourth Amendment and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted to committing attempted public indecency to a minor, in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-1001 and 1403(B), and the juvenile court adjudicated him delinquent of the admitted charge, placed him on probation, and ordered him to submit to DNA testing pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-610(O)(1) (Supp. 2003). Defendant argued that the word &quot;attempt,&quot; as used in &sect; 13-610(O)(1), only applied to homicide offenses and did not apply to the remaining offenses listed within &sect; 13-610(O)(1). The court held that &sect; 13-610(O)(1) mandated DNA testing of a juvenile adjudicated delinquent for attempting to commit any offense listed in that subsection, including a felony sexual offense listed in Ariz. Rev. Stat. ch. 14. The court rejected defendant's argument that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-610 was unconstitutional as applied to him because the DNA testing required by &sect; 13-610 served the government's special needs to identify perpetrators of past and future crimes and to deter a known class of offenders from re-offending. The primary purpose of &sect; 13-610 was not simply the advancement of a generalized interest in law enforcement without individualized suspicion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee crawled under a conveyor belt, and his right arm became caught, resulting in serious injury. Witnesses testified that the employee did not appear intoxicated that morning, but an expert testified that the employee's blood alcohol content at the time of the accident was 0.176. On appeal, the employee argued that the ALJ erred by determining that the employee's use of alcohol rendered his claim noncompensable pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1021(C) (amended 1996). The employee denied that intoxication more than slightly contributed to his work-related injury; however, there was sufficient evidence presented to support the ALJ's finding. The employee contended that &sect; 23-1021(C) and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1021(H)(2) (amended 1999) were unconstitutional as applied in this case because of the introduction of the concept of fault at the compensability stage of an industrial claim was inconsistent with Arizona case law and the no fault aspect of workers' compensation claims. The appellate court did not believe, however, that the legislature was precluded from regulating employment-related risks and determining that unnecessary risks were noncompensable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant water company challenged a decision of appellee Arizona Corporation Commission that denied its application for rehearing seeking review of the conditions imposed by the Commission on a proposed merger between the water company's parent company and a foreign corporation. The water company had sought a declaration that the Commission's Affiliated Interests Rules, Ariz. Admin. Comp. R. 14-2-801 to 14-2-806, did not apply to the merger.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The water company appealed the Commission's decision that imposed conditions on the proposed merger. The court noted that pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-254 (2001) the Legislature had given the superior court direct jurisdiction over all appeals from Commission orders except for a single class of appeals, which involved public service corporations and related to rate making or rate design as provided by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-254.01(A). The court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction because the Commission's order and the conditions it contained did not constitute rate-making or rate-design. The court noted that process of rate-making and/or rate-design had been characterized as one in which the Commission set rates and determined fair value of property and reasonable rates of return. The court concluded that the Commission's order and conditions did not set rates or determine the fair value of the water company's property or a reasonable rate of return on that property. The court rejected the argument that a Commission order could be directly appealed to the court as related to &quot;rate making or rate design&quot; merely because it affected rates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court had to determine whether monies given to a political party by a corporation for operating expenses fell within the constitutional prohibition of Ariz. Const. art. 14, &sect; 18. The phrase &quot;influencing any election&quot; could be reasonably construed in differing ways, and the monies contributed by corporations to political parties for operating expenses were not necessarily prohibited by the constitution. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 16-919 and 16-920 allowed labor organizations and corporations to spend money on non-partisan activities aimed at their own members, stockholders, and families. Monies contributed to the party were partisan and not limited to shareholders, members, or their families. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-901(5)(b)(v) provided for the exclusion of payments by a political party, not monies contributed to a political party. The legislature intended to preclude corporations and labor unions from utilizing treasury monies for contributions to political parties. The federal and Arizona's right to &quot;freely speak&quot; did not infringe upon the legislature's ability to completely ban corporate and labor contributions to parties whether designated for operating expenses or not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real party in interest defendant was convicted of sexual assault, sexual abuse, kidnapping, second-degree burglary, and first-degree murder in the Pima County Court (Arizona). As petitioner State was not seeking the death penalty, the sentencing options were life in prison or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years. Before sentencing, respondent judge entered orders resulting in the State's petitioning for special action relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentencing judge found the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Blakely v. Washington applied to defendant's sentencing and concluded that before he could impose life on the murder charge, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstances alleged. The appellate court was presented with two issues: whether Blakely required a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that certain aggravating circumstances existed before an Arizona trial judge could sentence a first-degree murder defendant to life rather than life with the possibility of parole and whether Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703.01(Q), which required judges to consider the aggravating circumstances in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-702 in choosing between those sentencing alternatives, applied retroactively to offenses committed before the statute's effective date. The appellate court denied relief on the latter question and affirmed the judge's orders that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703.01(Q) could not be applied retroactively. Because there was no presumptive or aggravated prison term for first-degree murder Blakely did not apply, and defendant was not entitled to a jury trial on the aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court granted partial relief by vacating those portions of the judge's orders compelling the State to prove and a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating factors alleged in the State's notice. The judge was directed to conduct sentencing proceedings consistent with the opinion and the Arizona Supreme Court's decision in Viramontes.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3884(1). In denying defendant's motion to suppress, the trial court ruled that the ranger had authority to stop and detain defendant's vehicle, not in his official capacity as a ranger, but as a private citizen. The court held defendant's erratic and dangerous driving constituted a breach of the peace for purposes of &sect; 13-3884. Because the ranger's actions in stopping and detaining defendant were those of a private citizen, the Fourth Amendment's requirement of probable cause was not implicated. Even if the citizen's arrest had been unlawful, the evidence would not have been suppressed. The exclusionary rule did not apply to the actions of private citizens. Driving a vehicle while intoxicated constituted a misdemeanor amounting to a breach of the peace within the meaning of &sect; 13-3884(1) and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to dismiss or to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court committed reversible error by permitting the amendment of the allegation of prior felony convictions. Nevertheless, nothing in the record showed that defendant objected to the amendment. Reviewing for fundamental error, the appellate court concluded that the claim was meritless. Defendant also contended that the State was required to prove the prior convictions beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court determined, however, that a heightened burden of proof was not applicable. Prior convictions for sentence enhancement need only be established by clear and convincing evidence. Turning to the sufficiency of the evidence, the appellate court noted that, to prove a prior conviction, the State must submit positive identification establishing that the accused was the same person who previously was convicted, as well as evidence of the conviction itself. That was done here. Defendant objected to the admission of the documents on the ground that, inter alia, the State failed to show that the convictions were final. The appellate court rejected this argument as summarily waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two officers stopped defendant for speeding. As one of the officers approached defendant's truck, defendant stepped out wearing a fanny pack around his waist.

Defendant argued that his conduct was lawful because a fanny pack fell within the luggage exception in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3102(F) (2001). The municipal court found that a fanny pack was not luggage but that the word &quot;luggage&quot; as used in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3102(F) was unconstitutionally vague. The superior court found that the municipal court erred in determining that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court ruled that a fanny pack was different from luggage for the purpose of applying the exemption from punishment for carrying a concealed weapon pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3102(F). Also, the use of the word &quot;luggage&quot; did not render the statute unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, festival owner/organizer and her husband, appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in Yavapai County (Arizona) that granted summary judgment for defendant county in the organizer's action which asserted both federal and state claims against the county based on a county ordinance that required event sponsors to be nonprofit organizations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organizer had been permitted to sponsor an art and craft festival at a county courthouse plaza until 2000, when the county adopted an ordinance that required event sponsors to be nonprofit organizations. The organizer filed suit claiming the ordinance violated the First Amendment, as well as Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 6. She argued that the courthouse plaza was a traditional public forum and the presentation and sale of arts and crafts at the festival was expressive conduct entitled to constitutional protection. The trial court entered judgment for the county. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that because the ordinance was not content-based, it did not need to be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, but needed to be narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest. The court concluded that avoiding competition with local merchants was a valid purpose, but the ordinance's limitation of event sponsors to non-profit organizations was neither significantly related to that purpose nor narrowly tailored to achieve it. The court held that ordinance was unconstitutional to the extent it limited sponsors to nonprofit organizations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court judgment and held that the county ordinance was unconstitutional to the extent it distinguished between nonprofit and for-profit sponsors. The court remanded the case for further proceedings as to whether plaintiff was damaged by the unconstitutionality and for a determination at trial of the amount of any damages. The court awarded costs to plaintiff festival organizer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's legal parents were divorced. The father, who was the primary residential parent, married the stepmother. The father was killed in a traffic accident, and the child began living with the mother. Although the trial court found that the stepmother had been a caring and supportive step-parent, it held that she was not entitled to visitation under &sect; 25-415(C) because she did not show that the child viewed her in the same sense as he viewed the mother. The appellate court agreed that the trial court improperly required the stepmother to prove that she stood in the place of either the father or the mother in order to establish in loco parentis status. To determine in loco parentis status under &sect; 25-415(G)(1), the trial court should have considered only whether the child viewed the stepmother as a parent and whether they had formed a meaningful parental relationship that had endured for a substantial period of time. The legislature clearly intended to authorize in loco parentis visitation by a non-parent, and there was no requirement that the petitioning party be of a different gender than a legal parent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant appealed a decision by the Industrial Commission of Arizona that affirmed respondent employer's denial of benefits. The claimant sought further review and asked the instant court to decide whether Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1021(D) (Supp. 2003) violated Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 8, by depriving workers of compensatory benefits for injuries caused in whole, or in part, or contributed to by necessary employment risks and dangers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent insurance carrier denied claimant's benefits, which he protested. At a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ), evidence showed the employer maintained a certified drug-testing policy in compliance with Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 23-493 to -493.11 (1995 &amp; Supp. 2003), and had certified its policy with the Industrial Commission, triggering the applicability of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1021(D). Applying the statute, the ALJ found the claim noncompensable because the claimant failed to prove his use of controlled substances was not a contributing cause of his injuries. The claimant, challenging the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1021(D), bore the burden of overcoming the presumption that the statute was constitutional. The appellate court would declare it unconstitutional only if it conflicted with Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 8. Because the statute abrogated claims for injuries partially contributed to by necessary risks of employment, it impermissibly conflicted with the constitution. Because the evidence suggested necessary risks of working on drywall stilts partially contributed to the accident, &sect; 23-1021(D) was unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Pima County, Arizona, granted the County's motion for summary judgment. The developer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the developer contended the ordinance was preempted by state statute and resulted in an unconstitutional taking of its property. The appellate court found that, although mislabeling it as the exhaustion doctrine, the trial court correctly applied the doctrine of primary jurisdiction and acted within its discretion in exercising jurisdiction to hear some, but not all, of the developer's claims. Contrary to the developer's assertion, the appellate court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3-914 authorized county ordinances not in conflict with the Arizona Native Plant Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 3-901 to 3-934. The ordinance in question did not conflict with the Act simply because it was a zoning ordinance; although the Act did not prevent the destruction of native plants on private property, neither did it confirm or confer an inalienable right to do so. The appellate court also ruled that the ordinance was not a regulatory taking of the developer's property, as it was able to make beneficial use of its land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The treasurer, who was not a party to the foreclosure action, argued that the purchaser filed the foreclosure action before expiration of the three year redemption period in violation of Ariz.

The parties, by stipulation, asked the trial court to resolve the legal issue of whether the treasurer was required to issue a deed pursuant to a foreclosure judgment if the treasurer believed that the foreclosure action was premature. The trial court rejected the stipulation and ruled on the validity of the default judgment, finding that the foreclosure was premature. The appellate court found that the treasurer had standing to question the foreclosure order, which was not binding on a non-party; the treasurer had an interest in determining whether he was required to issue the deed when he had reasonable grounds to believe that the foreclosure was improper. However, the trial court erred in treating the purchaser's petition as a motion to vacate the default judgment; it was unnecessary to vacate the judgment in order to determine whether the purchaser was entitled to an order directing the treasurer to issue the deed.</SPAN></P>

The officers approached defendant and conducted a pat-down search for weapons. The officers felt marijuana stems during the search. A search incident to arrest was conducted, and the officers found cocaine. On appeal, defendant challenged the admission of the evidence as the forbidden fruit of an unlawful, warrantless search. The appellate court determined that the investigative stop of defendant as a material witness passed the Brown test of reasonableness. The stop was related to a specific and known crime, and the stop was of an identified eyewitness. Moreover, a public interest was furthered by stopping defendant. The interference with defendant's liberty was only minimally intrusive. The officers were legitimately concerned for their safety in conducting the pat down search when the marijuana was discovered.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, granted the contractor summary judgment, finding that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-552(B) (2003) did not apply and the buyers' claims were barred. The buyers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the buyers contended the second exception under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-552(B) (2003) for a latent defect not discovered until the eighth year was applicable to save their claims from dismissal. Although the appellate court agreed with the legal conclusion of the trial court that the knowledge of the seller was imputed to the buyers to determine application of &sect; 12-552(B), it also found that genuine issues of material fact regarding the knowledge of the seller precluded summary judgment. Whether the seller's observations of unevenness in the floors before he sold it to the buyers constituted discovery of a defect, particularly in light of the contractor's alleged representation that the unevenness was normal settlement, was a question for the fact finder. Further, summary judgment granted in the contractor's favor on the buyers' negligence claim was improper, as the contractor's summary judgment motion focused on Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-552 (2003) and the negligence claim was not fully briefed prior to the argument. Because the successful party in the instant action was yet to be determined on remand, the appellate court declined to award the buyers attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner sought and obtained the city zoning commission's approval of a conditional use permit to construct a storage facility. The city council affirmed the approval decision. A local interest group opposed to the construction of the facility circulated petitions requesting that the city council place the matter on the ballot. Sufficient signatures were collected. The trial court, in denying declaratory and injunctive relief to the property owner, concluded that the city council acted in a legislative capacity when it approved the conditional use permit and that such legislative action was subject to referendum action under Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 1, &sect; 1(3). The court reversed, finding the approval decision to be administrative. The zoning commission was guided by objective criteria and standards set forth in Avondale, Ariz., Zoning Ord. &sect; 108(B)(2), (3), (5) in considering the grant or denial of a conditional use permit. The city council's involvement in hearing an appeal under Avondale, Ariz., Zoning Ord. &sect;&sect; 103(A)(2), 108(B) did not make the permit process a legislative act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, denied defendant's motion to exclude the testimony of two accomplices as being tainted by consistency provision in their plea agreements and did not advise the accomplices that the consistency provisions were unenforceable. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, first-degree burglary, and kidnapping. He appealed, claiming error in the admission of the accomplices' testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One accomplice testified that she, defendant, the other accomplice, and another woman drove the victim to a field. Both accomplices testified that defendant then shot the victim and directed each of them to shoot her as well, which they did. The accomplices admitted that they told police multiple versions of the events of the murder and that they knew that any variation in their trial testimony from the version given in a videotaped interview would cause them to lose the benefit of their plea agreements. The appellate court noted that, under Fisher, consistency provisions in plea agreements were unenforceable, and testimony tainted by such provisions was inadmissible. Defendant had standing to raise this issue, because his right to a fair trial was at stake. The error was not harmless, as the accomplices were the only eyewitnesses to testify. On retrial, the accomplices could testify if the taint were removed by not enforcing the consistency provision, by disclosing the terms of the agreement, and by properly instructing the jury. But, the State could not use their trial testimony or any statements they made after entering their plea agreements and before the taint was removed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose out of a collision between his vehicle and another vehicle.

He challenged the admissibility of the test used to detect marijuana in his body and the State's expert's opinion testimony regarding defendant's alleged impairment. The appellate court found that the trial court was not required to conduct a Frye hearing regarding the admissibility of the test because defendant failed to show either that the challenged evidence was a novel scientific method or was a formerly accepted method newly fallen into disrepute in the scientific community.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The problem began when the victim ended her dating relationship with defendant, and defendant would not stay away. She requested and obtained an injunction against harassment against defendant, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1809(A). That injunction order remained valid and in effect at all pertinent times. On appeal, defendant argued the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss and contended the harassment statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and violated his First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Criminal liability under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2921 was based on the &quot;manner&quot; in which certain communication was conveyed and the underlying purpose for the communication. Because the statute only criminalized communications made with a specific, deliberate purpose, the statute did not apply to pure First Amendment speech and instead regulated, at most, a blend of speech and conduct. Defendant's repeated entreaties to the victim that they resume their relationship did not contain any such particularized political or social message warranting First Amendment protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff affected utility brought suit before the Maricopa County Superior Court, Arizona challenging the Arizona Corporation Commissions' ratemaking rules. Plaintiff cooperatives and plaintiff council filed several suits. The suits were consolidated. The superior court granted and denied motions for summary judgment, and vacated decisions approving certificates of convenience and necessity (CC&amp;N). The parties appealed and cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission created the Retail Electric Competition Rules, Ariz. Admin. Code 14-2-1601 to 14-2-1616, to change the provision of electric generation from a system of regulated monopolies to a competitive one. Affected utilities could not offer competitive services other than as a part of their standard offer service. The rules also provided procedures for recovery of stranded costs. On appeal, the parties raised several issues concerning the viability of the rules under Ariz. Const. art. 15, &sect;&sect; 3 and 14. The Commission conceded that the superior court correctly ruled that article 15, &sect; 14 required the Commission to determine the fair value of property owned by the electric service providers, and consider that finding in setting rates. The appellate court determined, however, that the superior court erred by vacating the rules decisions in their entirety. The Commission only lacked constitutional or legislative authority to promulgate certain rules; for instance, those requiring divestiture of competitive generation assets affecting rates. Some of the rules could be severed from the rest. Finally, the superior court did properly vacate the CC&amp;N decisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed that portion of the judgment vacating the rules decisions in their entirety. The appellate court also reversed the decisions promulgating some of the rules. Other rules were to be submitted to the attorney general. The remaining portions of the rules decisions were affirmed. The judgment vacating the CC&amp;N decisions was affirmed. The award of attorneys' fees was affirmed. The matter was remanded for adjustments.</SPAN></P>

The court initially held that neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel precluded the homebuilders from bringing the instant action. The court then held that the county was authorized, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-861(A), (C)(1), to adopt individual building design criterion promulgated by a national organization or association organized and conducted for the purpose of developing codes in enacting its ordinance. The court further held that the county's ordinance did not unconstitutionally infringe on the homebuilders' right to privacy under Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 8 because the ordinance was proper exercise of the county's police power, and that the county's ordinance did not violate the homebuilders' equal protection rights under Ariz. Const. art.

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court in Coconino County (Arizona) entered convictions for one count of sexual assault and two counts of molestation of a child, all dangerous crimes against children under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604.01 (2001). Defendant appealed from his convictions and sentences. The State cross-appealed the trial court's sentencing of defendant to concurrent sentences for the sexual assault count and one of the molestation counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because only the court's resolution of the sentencing issue raised by the State merited publication, the court addressed and affirmed in a separate memorandum decision defendant's convictions. The State asserted that, under &sect; 13-604.01(K), the trial court was required to impose consecutive sentences for defendant's convictions for sexual assault and molestation of a child. The court agreed, stating that, when the two sentences of &sect; 13-604.01(K) were considered together, the sentencing discretion granted to the trial court by the first sentence was limited by the second sentence. Specifically, if defendant was convicted of child molestation or sexual abuse along with another offense that was not a dangerous crime against children, the trial court had discretion to order that the sentences be served concurrently if only one victim was involved. If, however, defendant was convicted of any &quot;other&quot; dangerous crime against children, the sentence for each such offense had to be served consecutively to any other sentence imposed. Therefore, the court reversed defendant's sentences for sexual assault and molestation of a child and remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court reversed the sentences for defendant's convictions for sexual assault and molestation of a child.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A company related to the developer purchased property in the town, which was in the heavy industrial zone, to maintain a mobile medical waste treatment system after the town's planning and zoning administrator orally stated that the proposed use would be permitted. However, the company was required to apply for a conditional use permit (CUP), which was eventually denied. Reversing and remanding, the court held that the developer had a personal stake in the town's denial of the company's CUP application and that the administrator's initial decision that the proposed use was permitted and the later decision of town staff that a CUP would be required were not, as a matter of law, final, and thus not ripe for judicial review. However, the trial court erred in denying the town's judgment as a matter of law motion on the developer's substantive due process and equal protection claims because it was clear that the developer could not have had a &quot;reasonable expectation of entitlement&quot; to have the CUP application granted, the town did not unconstitutionally deprive it of any interest, and the record did not reflect that the town treated the developer differently from other applicants.</SPAN></P>

The corporation moved for summary judgment on the ground that the newly enacted statute of limitations, Ariz. Rev.

On appeal, the court determined that the city had no unassailable right to enforce its zoning and sign codes. The legislature could retroactively restrict or modify the city's enforcement authority. The court further found that the two-year limitation period prescribed in &sect; 9-462.02(C) began upon the city's discovery of the zoning or sign code violations. The city had no vested rights in enforcing its zoning and sign codes. If the legislature had intended the new statute of limitations to only have prospective application, it could have so specified or otherwise indicated that any preexisting claims were preserved. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to consider the documents the city had proffered as evidence of the legislature's intent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Ariz. Rev.

The men alleged that the statutes violated their fundamental right to marry and their right to equal protection under the laws. The court exercised its discretion to accept jurisdiction based on the issue of first impression raised, but the court denied the men the relief sought. The court held that the fundamental right to marry protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 4 did not encompass the right to marry a same-sex partner. The State had a legitimate interest in encouraging procreation and child rearing within the marital relationship and limiting that relationship to opposite-sex couples. Because the State's prohibition against same-sex marriages rationally furthered a legitimate State interest, the prohibition did not deprive the men of their constitutional rights to substantive due process, privacy under Ariz.

The court affirmed, stating that the issue in the case was whether the operator was immune form liability because it had met all of the conditions required by &sect; 12-553. The document that the rider signed contained sufficient information to have been considered a release under &sect; 12-553(E)(2). The release in question contained an acknowledgment that the rider knew of the inherent risks associated with riding a horse. The court further stated that &sect; 12-553 was designed to protect equine owners and agents from lawsuits. That was a legitimate state interest and &sect; 12-553 furthered that interest by immunizing equine owners from liability when their riders have signed a release. Accordingly, &sect; 12-553 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Further, &sect; 12-553 did not violate the anti-abrogation clause, Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a special action to challenge a decision from respondent judge in Maricopa County Superior Court (Arizona), which denied defendant's motion to compel real party in interest State to copy certain documents under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 15.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with numerous crimes involving sexual acts with children. Several videotapes and photographs were seized from defendant's possession by police. Defendant wanted the State to copy the materials for use in his defense. After the trial court denied defendant's motion to compel, he filed a special petition action. In vacating the trial court's decision, the court determined that the trial court abused its discretion by denying defendant's motion. Defendant was entitled to a copy of the materials under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 15.1 (Supp. 2002). There was nothing in Rule 15.1 that made an exception for contraband. The State failed to demonstrate any good cause for an order protecting it from compliance with Rule 15.1. There was no showing that defendant or his attorney would have used the material in violation of Ariz. R. Crim. P. 15.4. Defendant had no burden of proof when seeking production. Finally, the fact that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3553 did not provide immunity for defense counsel's possession of such materials did not mean that they were exempt from disclosure under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 15.1.</SPAN></P>

The court also noted that the trial court was permitted to issue an order imposing safeguards on the copying and use of the materials.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a special action, petitioner school district challenged respondent judge's ruling that the district's board violated Arizona's open meeting laws in selecting a site on which to build a high school and that the district could not use funds from the Arizona School Facilities Board (SFB) to pay severance damages in a condemnation action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge ruled that the district's board violated Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-431.01(A) in meetings held by improperly conducting its site selection process in executive sessions. On review, the district court contended the judge abused her discretion in so ruling, noting that she did not explain the basis for it and asserting that the interpretation by the coalition (the real parties in interest who originally brought the suit) of the statute was erroneous. The appellate court determined that the statutory language in question was susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation; based on the facts of the case, the appellate court concluded that the judge did not abuse her discretion in finding that the board violated the open meetings law. However, because the appellate court found no merit to the coalition's arguments that the district's board's ratification of its selection of the site was either untimely or ineffective, the judge abused her discretion in denying the district's motion for reconsideration. The appellate court concluded that the district was not prohibited from using SFB funds to pay severance damages in a condemnation action to acquire the site.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence and argued that the officer lacked reasonable suspicion to stop her vehicle because she had not violated any laws. The State countered that defendant had violated Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-729(1) by briefly traversing the shoulder line. The trial court granted the motion to suppress. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that under &sect; 28-729(1), a driver was required to remain exclusively in a single lane only &quot;as nearly as practicable&quot; under the circumstances. That language demonstrated an express legislative intent to avoid penalizing brief, momentary, and minor deviations outside the marked lines. The State did not dispute that defendant otherwise drove safely on a dangerous, curved road apart from her alleged isolated and minor breach of the shoulder line. Under such circumstances, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found that defendant committed no violation and implicitly found that the officer had lacked a reasonable basis for the stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle for the driver's failure to signal before a turn. One of the officers approached defendant, the front seat passenger in the vehicle, who was not wearing a seatbelt. The officer asked defendant for identification, and defendant responded that he lacked any written identification. The officer then arrested defendant pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1595(C) for failure to provide evidence of identification when he was not wearing his seatbelt. The trial court found Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1595(C)&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague for failing to give notice to passengers in motor vehicles of the type of identification that had to be produced under the statute. The appellate court ruled that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1595(C) was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to provide reasonable notice to passengers or others of what evidence of identity was required to avoid violation of the statute. The statutory definition of &quot;evidence of identity&quot; imposed upon drivers under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1595(B) (1998) could not be similarly imposed upon passengers under Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real party in interest contended that Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 22, and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3961(A), implementing a voter-approved proposition, unconstitutionally precluded bail for sexual conduct with a minor when the proof was evident or the presumption great that the party charged committed the offense. The party argued that the provisions violated his constitutional right to bail and, since his alleged criminal conduct occurred prior to the effective date of the provisions, constituted unlawful ex post facto laws. The appellate court first held that, since there was no absolute right to bail and the provisions did not totally abolish bail for the party's offense, no cruel and unusual punishment was inflicted by denying bail upon a proper showing of sufficient indicia of guilt. Further, the provisions did not change the definition of the crime or quantum of punishment, and thus the provisions were procedural rather than punitive, precluding any claim of ex post facto unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Arizona Department of Revenue (ADOR) and 15 counties appealed from the Arizona Tax Court's judgment that ADOR violated the Uniformity Clause, Ariz. Const. art. 9, &sect; 1, and the Equal Protection Clause, Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 13, in applying former Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 42-793 and 42-793.01 (1997) (repealed) (now Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-14403) to a regional telecommunications company and to 6 incumbent local exchange carriers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The main issue was whether the property of the company and the local carriers, as comparison taxpayers, was functionally equivalent. The appellate court held that the U.S. West decision did not preclude the tax court from granting the company relief because of the nature of the company's claim and because of the changes in the telecommunications industry since the company brought its last challenge. The company challenged ADOR's use of the &quot;market value&quot; method under former &sect;&sect; 42-793(A)(1) and -793.01 for valuing its class 3 property, which included intraLATA (Local Access and Transport Areas) toll calls, vertical services including such features as caller ID and call waiting, and access services between telecommunications networks. That method, which was different from the &quot;historical cost less depreciation&quot; method applied to the local carriers pursuant to &sect; 42-793(A)(2), resulted in the company's higher valuation. However, the company produced substantial evidence that it was a direct competitor in the same industry as other telecommunications companies and that its class 3 telecommunications property was functionally identical to that of the local carriers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax court's ruling with respect to the company's discrimination claim was affirmed. The tax court's rulings with respect to the local carrier's discrimination claims was reversed and remanded for further consideration of functional equivalency. In addition, the company was awarded its attorney fees and costs on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the president contended the city's pawnbroker transaction fee under Phoenix, Ariz., City Code &sect; 10-151(A) was an unconstitutional &quot;tax&quot; in violation of the Ariz. Const. art. IX, &sect; 6. Alternatively, he argued that the state legislature preempted local control over pawnshops, therefore, the transaction fee ordinance was invalid, as it exceeded the limited scope of local regulation allowed by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-1632 (2003). Finally, he contended that, at the least, the fees were unconstitutionally excessive, because they were not in reasonable proportion to the services rendered. The appellate court disagreed on all of defendant's points, holding first that the charges were fees and not taxes. Further, the fee was assessed by the governmental entity that had been delegated regulatory authority over pawn transaction reports pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-1625 (2003). Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-1626(B)(6) (2003) did not evince an intent to preempt the city's transaction fee ordinance. Even assuming that the transaction fees covered all of the city's intended costs, they were not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, eight school districts, claimed that Ariz. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1 was violated because the Arizona Legislature failed to fund the Building Renewal Fund (BRF), a component of the Students FIRST legislation, according to the statutory formula for fiscal years 1999-2003, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-2031 (Supp. 2002). The Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) agreed with the districts. Appellant State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the districts showed that they had capital facilities needing repairs and renovation, they did not link those needs to their pupils' scholastic performance. They showed instead that district officials had a more difficult situation than they would have if there were sufficient funds available to improve their facilities not directly linked to pedagogical success. While the districts complained about the lack of funding of the BRF to the extent of the statutory formula, they did not complain that BRF expenditures were directed in the first instance to those facilities &quot;necessary and appropriate to enable pupils to achieve designated academic standards,&quot; nor had they challenged the School Facilities Board (SFB) guidelines. The facilities about which they complained were either new construction excluded from the BRF or primarily administrative and as such, were not required to meet the State's academic standards. There was no doubt that the public schools in Arizona needed adequate funding for students to achieve the academic standards declared by the legislature. However, the school districts had not shown that they had current unmet needs related to academic achievement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded. The award of attorney fees to the school districts was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, dismissed indictments against defendants for sexual exploitation of a minor, in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3553(a)(2) (Supp. 2002), by finding that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad because it encompassed expression protected by the First Amendment. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred by ruling that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3553 (Supp. 2002), which prohibited the creation and possession of child pornography, was constitutionally overbroad. The appellate court noted that the statute did not encompass material in which an actual child was not involved. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3556, by using the term &quot;participant,&quot; implied the existence of an actual person as opposed to a fictitious character. By permitting an inference that the participant was a minor, the legislature reinforced that its intent in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3553 was solely to prohibit material using actual minors. Even though the punishment for violating &sect; 13-3553 was severe, this did not provide support for invalidating the statute. The term &quot;simulated&quot; modified the conduct which was depicted, not the participant. The statute proscribed conduct related to the material only where it involved actual children actually participating in real or simulated sexual or exploitative acts. The appellate court did not know if the materials at issue could arguably fall within any definition of having serious literary, artistic, scientific or educational value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rulings by the trial court finding the statutes dealing with sexual exploitation of children to be constitutionally overbroad were reversed, the orders dismissing the indictments were vacated, and those case were remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The State moved to dismiss. The Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) dismissed all of the claims against the State, citing a lack of jurisdiction. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court held that the owners had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before the Arizona Department of Revenue (ADOR). Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-1516(4) provided tax credits and other benefits for people who converted their new vehicles to alternative fuel vehicles. The statute was called the April Law. In December 2002 (the December Law) the Arizona Legislature amended the April Law. The owners did not only contest the amount of tax credits that they had received; they also challenged the requirements imposed by the December Law to keep those credits. The appellate court held that, because the owners complained about government benefits for which the legislature had provided a mandatory administrative remedy, the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies applied and the appellate court rejected the owners' attempt to circumvent the administrative process by the construction of their complaint. If the owners had not been satisfied by the ADOR ruling, they could have appealed the decision to the State Board of Tax Appeals, which was independent of ADOR. Only if the administrative appeal was unsuccessful, could the owners then have filed an action in superior court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part. The superior court's dismissal of the owners' action for public records was reversed and the matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appeared evasive, made inconsistent statements about where he had been staying, and refused consent to search the car. The county officer, who had a trained narcotics detection dog in his cruiser, promptly conducted a dog sniff search. The dog alerted to the presence of drugs, and the officer found marijuana in the trunk. The court found no error in the denial of defendant's motion to suppress, holding that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1594 authorized the county officer to stop defendant for a traffic violation committed outside the county officer's presence. Moreover, a dog sniff of a lawfully detained vehicle was not a search for Fourth Amendment purposes, and the continued detention of defendant for the purpose of conducting the dog sniff was sufficiently brief to be permissible.</SPAN></P>

Trial proceeded, and defendant was convicted of aggravated assault, misdemeanor assault, and disorderly conduct with a deadly weapon. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the morning of trial, defendant attempted to accept a plea offer made the night before. The district attorney indicated she would call her supervisor and the victims for approval of the offer.

On appeal, the court held that the trial court's refusal to consider any plea negotiated except on an all or none basis, merely because the jury panel was gathered, improperly read a plea cut-off date into Ariz. R. Crim. P. 17.4(a) and foreclosed plea negotiations. Under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 17.4, defendant had a right to have any plea agreement reached addressed on the merits by the trial court. Only the district attorney's office had the right to terminate plea bargaining. Refusing to accept a conditional or partial plea also did not address the concern about the prospective jurors' time. The court held that the proper remedy was to vacate the convictions and sentences and to allow the parties to proceed with the plea negotiations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the extreme DUI charge on the ground that the 2001 amendment to &sect; 28-1382(A), which reduced the alcohol concentration limit, was unconstitutional. The motion was denied, and defendant was found guilty as charged. The court concluded that, having the amendment to &sect; 28-1382(A) become immediately effective, pursuant to an emergency clause, without a grace period or specific notice to the public, did not violate due process. The court held that, because the amendment was passed with an emergency clause, it became effective the date it was signed by the governor and filed with the secretary of state. The court held defendant's conduct in operating a vehicle under the influence could not be construed as a passive act and did not involve conduct or circumstances so presumptively innocent as to fall within the exception to the traditional rule that ignorance of the law was no excuse. The court held that defendant was on notice of the existence of the laws regulating driving under the influence and could not avoid prosecution by asserting that the State failed to inform him of the particulars of the amended statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowner was convicted of possession of a narcotic drug for sale and possession of drug paraphernalia. Appellee State filed a civil, in rem complaint seeking forfeiture of the house. The Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) entered summary judgment in favor of the State and forfeited the owner's interest in his house, in which police had found a large amount of drugs, cash and several guns. The homeowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, the owner argued that the trial court erred by allowing the state to exact an excessive fine. He contended the forfeiture of his house amounted to a punitive fine wholly out of proportion to the crimes for which he was convicted. The appellate court applied the Austin and Bajakajian analyses to in rem forfeiture under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2314 to determine if it too had a punitive element. Because &sect; 13-2314(G) had a deterrent purpose, it was not solely remedial. Since the owner's house was not the instrument of his crime, and because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2314(G) had both retributive and deterrent aspects, the Court of Appeals of Arizona, Division Two, Department A, found that the civil, in rem forfeiture of the house was punishment, at least in part. However, the legislature considered possession of a narcotic drug for sale a very serious crime. Comparing the value of the house to the offense, the forfeited amount (or value) was not grossly disproportional to the crime committed. The appellate court concluded that the forfeiture of the owner's house, although subject to review under the U.S. Const. amend. VIII, did not amount to an unconstitutionally excessive fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was prosecuted as an adult and, after a bench trial, was found guilty by the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) of possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court had personal jurisdiction over the juvenile, even though the State violated the directive of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-501(D) because, despite the lack of notice, the juvenile was well aware of the allegation that he was a chronic felony offender. Moreover, he received a hearing pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-501(E) at which the State had to prove, and the superior court had to find, that he in fact was a chronic felony offender as defined in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-501(G)(2). The State satisfied its burden that the juvenile was a chronic felony offender because it was not required to introduce the juvenile court minute entries into evidence for the superior court to make the factual finding. In addition, by not objecting at the time, the juvenile waived any argument that the State's evidence was inadequate.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-501(E) was not constitutionally flawed under the Apprendi rule because it was not a sentence enhancement scheme. The superior court properly denied a motion to suppress the gun because the officers could have reasonably perceived an immediate danger to their safety that warranted lifting a mattress and temporarily seizing the gun.</SPAN></P>

A jury found defendant guilty of aggravated assault for shooting the police officer, in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1203(A)(1) (1989). Defendant was then retried in the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) on bystander assault charges using the doctrine of transferred intent and was found guilty of five counts of aggravated assault. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over defendant's objection, the trial court instructed the jury on transferred intent, permitting the State to argue that defendant's intent to shoot the police officer could be transferred to serve as the intent for the assaults on the bystanders. Defendant argued that the court erred by instructing the jury on transferred intent. The appellate court concluded that the intent to shoot and cause injury or death could not have been transferred to have provided the intent to have placed the bystanders in reasonable apprehension of imminent physical injury, and the jury instruction had therefore been erroneous. The assault conviction against defendant for the shooting of the officer was for the form of assault defined in &sect; 13-1203(A)(1) (1989) as &quot;intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causing any physical injury to another person.&quot; In contrast, the bystander assault charges were based on the apprehension form of assault defined in &sect; 13-1203(A)(2) (1989) as &quot;intentionally placing another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent physical injury.&quot; It could not have been presumed from the act of firing a shot at the officer that defendant intended to scare any of the bystanders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After real party in interest, pursuant to a plea agreement, pleaded guilty to reckless manslaughter, respondent trial court judge entered presentence orders regarding the constitutionality and burden of proof under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-702 and -702.01. The judge sua sponte vacated its order to allow petitioner State of Arizona to seek review in the instant special action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plea agreement set forth the minimum sentence of 3 years, presumptive sentence of 5 years, and maximum sentence of 12.5 years for reckless manslaughter. The judge entered an order that the State would have to prove to a jury and beyond a reasonable doubt any aggravating circumstances alleged under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-702(C). After the State petitioned for relief from that order, the judge ruled that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-702 and -702.01 were unconstitutional facially and as applied to real party in interest. The court granted the State's petition for review in a special action and held that the statutes were not unconstitutional. Reckless manslaughter, a violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1103(A)(1) and (B), was a class two felony, the sentence for which was provided to be 5 years under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-701. The court held that such was a presumptive, not a maximum, sentence. The court further held that the trial court could order a sentence within the 3- to 12.5-year range without running afoul of the Fifth or Sixth Amendments, as such would not result in a sentence greater than the maximum prescribed by statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted relief, reaffirmed its prior order vacating the judge's orders, and vacated the judge's orders. The court directed that further proceedings could proceed in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An amendment proposed mid-trial changed the original charge from an assault committed by a knowing touching of an officer with the intent to injure, insult, or provoke to an assault committed by intentionally placing the officer in reasonable apprehension. After overruling defendant's objection to the amendment, the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, convicted defendant of aggravated assault. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court violated the Sixth Amendment's notice requirement when it permitted the State to amend the assault charge after the close of the state's case-in-chief. The appellate court determined that the amendment changed the nature of the originally charged offense, as the amended charge specified that defendant intentionally placed the officer in reasonable apprehension of imminent physical injury. Assault committed in this fashion required a showing of defendant's intent to create fear of injury in the officer, and merely showing an intent to provoke or insult would not have sufficed. As &quot;reasonable apprehension&quot; assault was a different offense from &quot;knowing touching&quot; assault, the appellate court held that the mid-trial amendment from the one to the other changed the nature of the offense, was prejudicial per se, and was therefore impermissible under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 13.5(b). As such, the trial court violated the Sixth Amendment by permitting the State to amend the charge, thereby depriving defendant of his right to sufficient notice of the charges against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother, on her own behalf and that of her minor son, filed a personal injury lawsuit against defendant city seeking damages for injuries the son suffered while playing in a city park. The Superior Court of Pinal County, Arizona, granted the city's motion for summary judgment. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son was injured when, while riding his bicycle under a soccer goal, he tried to reach up to grab the crossbar; the crossbar broke and both he and the bar fell to the ground. On review, the mother contended, inter alia, that Arizona's recreational use immunity statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-1551 did not apply to this case. Finding that Ariz. Rev. Stat. 13-1551(C)(3) specifically included parks in its definition of premises, that installing soccer fields, including goals, in a park did not change the park's recreational character, and that soccer goals were the type of apparatus one would expect to find on a park field, the appellate court ruled that the statute applied. Future, the mother did not present sufficient evidence to create a material issue of fact on whether the city knew or should have known, even by regular inspections, about the goal's allegedly defective condition and, thus, knew or should have known that the goal posed an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily injury to children in the park. The mother failed to raise material issues of fact to preclude summary judgment on her attractive nuisance and gross negligence causes of action.</SPAN></P>

However, the instant court found that &sect; 23-54 was not vague as the applicable ordinances and rules reasonably informed employees of such facilities as to the limits of their permitted activities and the prohibitions regarding live sex act businesses found in &sect; 23-54 did not conflict with any other city ordinance or State law regarding sexually oriented businesses. The instant court also found there was no realistic danger that &sect; 23-54 would significantly jeopardize recognized First Amendment protections of nude or erotic dancers/performers; thus, the ordinance was not overbroad.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-2301(D)(4), 13-2314(G), 13-3413, and 13-4301 through 4315, after the State found a total of 862.5 pounds of marijuana at the premises.

</DIV>

Because the owner timely filed a notice of appeal from an appealable order, the appellate court concluded that it had jurisdiction. The legislature could not have divested the owner of that substantive right or the appellate court to hear his appeal because of his failure to have complied with a statute that conflicted with a rule promulgated by the Supreme Court of Arizona. The State disclosed the witness's name on July 6, 2001, and the fingerprint evidence on July 10, although the owner moved to produce reports of &quot;fingerprint comparisons&quot; in March 2000. Trial began on July 12. The State claimed the witness had not been a surprise witness, as his name was disclosed in the police reports, and the owner repeatedly discussed the witness's prior criminal history before trial with the prosecutor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, two juveniles, pled guilty to separate crimes of possession of marijuana and theft. Appellants challenged the judgment of the Maricopa County Superior Court (Arizona), which entered dispositions requiring the two juveniles to participate in the Maricopa County Juvenile Drug Court program as a special term of standard probation. The juveniles' appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the juveniles argued that participation in Drug Court violated fundamental constitutional rights. The juveniles argued that involuntary placement in Drug Court did not promote rehabilitation and was not in fact reasonably related to the purpose of juvenile probation. Further, the juveniles contended that the facts of their respective cases did not support their placement in Drug Court. The appellate court held that the purposes of the Drug Court were directed towards rehabilitation and based upon the record. The juveniles' constitutional rights were not violated. Both juveniles were already on standard probation, and both juveniles' parents indicated willingness to have their children in the program. Furthermore, both juveniles initially wanted to participate. Therefore, the trial court's disposition was not an abuse of discretion. The court also found that the Drug Court procedures did not violate due process, the juvenile's protection against self-incrimination, or equal protection. Requiring Drug Court participation as a special term of probation was rationally related to rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant clients challenged a decision from the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which dismissed their negligence action against appellee attorneys after the clients failed to produce an expert opinion certificate, as required by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2602(A) (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clients retained the attorneys to represent them in a case against a corporation. Later, the clients filed a negligence action. However, the claim was dismissed, as the clients failed to file an expert witness certificate, as required by &sect; 12-2602(A). The clients contended that &sect; 12-2602 was unconstitutional. In affirming, the court determined that &sect; 12-2602 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 13.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2602 did not implicate a fundamental right or discriminate against individuals based on a suspect class. First, &sect; 12-2602 had been amended so as not to require an expert opinion. Moreover, it did not restrict the choice of experts, require service of an expert affidavit with the complaint, and did not mandate dismissal. The court also found that &sect; 12-2602 did not implicate a suspect class. Because &sect; 12-2602 was rationally based and furthered a legitimate state interest, it was constitutional. Additionally, the court determined that the Separation of Powers Clause, Ariz. Const. art. 3 was not violated. Nothing in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2602 was in conflict with or engulfed the Arizona Supreme Court's rulemaking power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant adult-oriented business sought an injunction against the enforcement of Ariz. Rev.

The Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) denied injunctive relief, holding that the statute did not violate Arizona's constitution. The business appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business contended the greater scope of art. II, &sect; 6 protected the non-obscene, sexually explicit materials and live performances encompassed by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-1422 and 11-821. The appellate court held that the application of &sect; 13-1422 to an adult theater, as defined in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-821, did not violate Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 6 or 13. The appellate court further held, that the application of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1422 to an adult arcade, adult bookstore or video store, and adult motion picture theater, as they were defined in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-821, did violate Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 6. The closing-hours requirement of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1422 was valid and enforceable as applied to an adult theater and invalid and unenforceable as applied to an adult arcade, adult bookstore or video store, and adult motion picture theater. Accordingly, as to the valid, enforceable application of &sect; 13-1422, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's granting of declaratory judgment in favor of the city and denial injunctive relief to the business. The invalid portions were severable from the remainder of &sect; 13-1422, and the remaining valid portion remained in force.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's granting of declaratory judgment in favor of the city and state and denial injunctive relief to the business was affirmed. But, as to the invalid, unenforceable application of Ariz. Rev.

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 15-816 and 15-816.01 (2002), and equal protection rights. The student appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student voluntarily transferred to another school and was found ineligible to play sports for one year. The student argued that the transfer rule was invalid, as it conflicted with Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 15-816 and 15-816.01(A), which established an open enrollment policy in Arizona schools. The appellate court found that, while a student had a right to a public education, participation in interscholastic athletics was not a constitutionally protected right. The open enrollment statutes did not protect a transferring student's right to participate in interscholastic athletics. The association's bylaws did not prohibit the application of the open enrollment policy and were not an improper encroachment on the legislature's powers. Because the student was not a member of a suspect class, nor had he been deprived of a fundamental right, the rational basis test was the appropriate test to determine whether the transfer rule violated equal protection rights. By establishing objective eligibility standards, the transfer rule acted to deter athletically motivated transfers. The judgment enjoining enforcement of the restitution rule was a judgment in the student's favor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county board of supervisors considered and approved a county-initiated rezoning of a parcel of land owned by realty company and the convenience stores.

Stat. &sect; 11-829(F). The realty company first contended Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-829(F) was not a delegation of authority to property owners, but merely constituted the legislature's withdrawal of a portion of the counties' zoning power. The appellate court determined that nothing in the legislative history suggested the Arizona legislature adopted Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-829(F) intending to completely withdraw counties' zoning powers or to enact a total prohibition on county-initiated downzoning. Instead, the legislative history indicated that the legislature's purpose in adopting the subsection was protecting property values through the owner consent provision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, companies that owned personal property and did business in Arizona at multiple locations, appealed the summary judgment entered by Arizona Tax Court against them based on the conclusion that the Arizona Constitution allowed the legislature to exempt from taxation a maximum of $ 50,000 per year of personal property of a taxpayer used for agricultural, trade, or business purposes, regardless of the number of locations owned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies contended that Arizona law should have been interpreted to have allowed a $ 50,000 annual exemption for property at each location. On the basis of Ariz. Const. art. 9, &sect; 2(6), the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the tax court. Article 9, &sect; 2(6) limited the power of the legislature to extend to each taxpayer more than one annual tax exemption up to $ 50,000 of agricultural, trade, or business property, regardless of the number of locations at which the taxpayer put such property to use, and the appellate court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-11127 (1999) was unconstitutional, because it purported to grant exemptions to each &quot;assessment account&quot; or location, allowing multiple exemptions for multiple locations. The appellate court declared former Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-280 (1997) to have been automatically revived to take the place of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-11127. The tax court did not abuse its discretion by denying the companies additional time to conduct discovery pertaining to their Uniformity Clause argument. Because the companies did not prevail, their request for attorney fees pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-348(B) (Supp. 2001) was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city councilman appealed from an injunction against harassment issued by the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) that precluded him from initiating &quot;in person&quot; contact with appellee chairman of a citizen's committee. The chairman petitioned for an ex parte injunction against the councilman to prohibit &quot;harassment,&quot; pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1809(R) (Supp. 2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues were whether an injunction against harassment that restricted protected political speech was unconstitutional and could the statute that authorized injunctions against harassment be given an interpretation that rendered it constitutional? The appellate court answered those questions in the affirmative. The plain language of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1809(R) (Supp. 2000) required a finding that the councilman engaged in a &quot;series of acts&quot; of harassment that were &quot;directed at a specific person.&quot; One of the two reported incidents concerned a conversation between the councilman and another person. The committee chairman overheard part of that conversation in which the councilman denounced the committee's efforts and allegedly used words such as &quot;bigot,&quot; &quot;fascist,&quot; and &quot;homophobe&quot; to describe him. The councilman's communication did not satisfy the definition of harassment. The appellate court also held that &sect; 12-1809 was not unconstitutional in all its potential applications, as long as its definition of harassment, conduct that &quot;served no legitimate purpose,&quot; was construed to exclude pure political speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to call three witnesses to testify that defendant committed similar acts of sexual misconduct against them. The State claimed the three were victims who had the right to refuse defense interviews under the Victims' Bill of Rights, Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 2.1(A) and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4433. Only one of the witnesses' claims resulted in criminal charges against defendant. Defendant moved to compel interviews with the witnesses, and the trial court granted the motion. The appellate court had to address the issue of whether victims' rights attached to witnesses in the prosecution of a defendant for an offense against a third person. The court found that the witness who's claim resulted in criminal charges against defendant had the right to refuse an interview as a continuation of her rights that were implemented pursuant to her status as a victim in her own case, not from defendant's arrest or prosecution in the instant case. However, the court found that the remaining two witnesses' rights to refuse to be interviewed had not yet arisen, because defendant had not been charged for any criminal acts he might have committed against those two prospective witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's granting of defendant's motion to compel interviews with three witnesses was reversed as to one witness and affirmed as to the other two witnesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1321(G) and (K), a department of transportation, motor vehicle division (MVD), administrative law judge (ALJ) suspended appellee motorist's license for 12 months for driving under the influence (DUI). The Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) vacated the suspension of the license because it held that the police had lacked probable cause to stop the motorist. The MVD appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue, one of first impression in Arizona was: did the alleged unconstitutionality of a law enforcement officer's stop of a vehicle invalidate the State's subsequent suspension of the motorist's driver's license, pursuant to &sect; 28-1321, based on the motorist's refusal to submit to a breath test after having been arrested for DUI? The ALJ implicitly answered the question in the negative. The superior court ruled otherwise. The MVD contended the superior court erroneously considered whether the stop of the vehicle had been lawful, arguing that &sect; 28-1321(K) expressly limited the scope of issues for administrative review. The appellate court found that there was nothing in &sect; 28-1321 or its underlying rationale that suggested any intent to incorporate all the procedural protections available to a DUI criminal defendant into a civil license suspension. Rather, the legislature had apparently intended such hearings to be narrowly focused, inter alia, on the question of whether a police officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the motorist had been driving while under the influence regardless of the circumstances of the underlying stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court's order was reversed and the ALJ's license suspension order was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 36-3701 to -3717 (Supp. 2001). Petitioner raised several evidentiary issues and also argued that the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner also argued that the Act violated the due process rights of persons committed thereunder by not requiring a finding of serious difficulty in controlling behavior, in accordance with Crane.

The appellate court vacated the commitment order, because there was no specific finding at the commitment hearing that petitioner had serious difficulty controlling his behavior. The court then asked whether due process, according to Hendricks, required an additional finding of volitional incapacity? The appellate court held that based on Crane, it was not enough that Arizona's Act required a finding of dangerousness linked with the existence of a mental disorder. To pass constitutional muster, the Act had to also require proof of serious difficulty controlling behavior, which it did.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury of the Pima County Superior Court, Arizona, found defendant guilty of two counts of unlawful sale of a narcotic drug. After finding he had three prior convictions and had committed these offenses while on release for a separate felony offense, the trial court sentenced defendant to concurrent, presumptive, 17.75-year prison terms, including a two-year mandatory enhancement, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604(R). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in: (1) responding ex parte to a jury question; (2) finding, instead of permitting the jury to find, that he was on release at the time he committed his offenses; and (3) finding that his out-of-state convictions constituted historical prior felony convictions. The instant court found no merit to defendant's first and third claims. In answering the jury's question, the trial court neither explicitly nor implicitly commented on the evidence. The instant court was unable to conclude that defendant suffered any prejudice; thus, any error the trial court might have committed was harmless. Regarding defendant's out-of-state convictions, the trial court did not err in imposing an enhanced sentence, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604(D), based on defendant's having had two or more historical prior felony convictions. The trial court erred, however, in failing to submit defendant's release status to the jury. The instant court agreed that Apprendi v. New Jersey required that any fact, other than the fact of a prior conviction, exposing a defendant to a punishment greater than that otherwise permissible had to be determined by a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court vacated defendant's sentence enhancement. However, because the trial court found neither aggravating nor mitigating factors, it did not need to vacate the presumptive sentences the trial court imposed on defendant's unlawful sale convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tax payer filed a special action in the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) that challenged the Arizona Tourism and Sports Authority (TSA), Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5-802 to -877 (Supp. 2001), as an unconstitutional &quot;special law,&quot; as it benefited only one county in the state. The superior court concluded that the TSA legislation did not violate any constitutional provision. The tax payer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues were whether legislation creating and implementing the TSA was an unconstitutional special law favoring only one of the state's counties and whether the TSA funding mechanism violated the constitutional debt limitation. The appellate court held that the population classification used in the TSA legislation was sufficiently elastic, as it allowed entry and exit from the class upon requisite changes in population, and, after severing language from Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 5-866 that authorized the TSA to pledge all monies received by it to pay and secure bond obligations, did not violate Ariz. Const. art. 9, &sect; 5, as it was not an unconstitutional special law favoring only the one county. The appellate court also held that the TSA did not violate the constitutional state-debt restriction by pledging specified transaction privilege taxes and income taxes to pay and secure bond obligations. However, the TSA could not constitutionally pledge income taxes paid by a sports team's employees or their spouses on income unrelated to professional football. Likewise, the TSA was prohibited from pledging monies from the state's general funds to pay and secure bond obligations.</SPAN></P>

The ALJ based his finding on the employee's argument that the &quot;definitive factor&quot; for determining the Act's applicability was the existence of a scheme or plan or periodic need for extra short-term employees in the usual course of the business of the employer, and that for a part of the year during which his injury occurred, the employer hired workers 25 percent of the time. The court rejected the ALJ's reasoning, finding that the determinative question was whether the employer customarily or regularly employed at least one worker, or whether he hired extra labor only occasionally and unpredictably, and that the record did not reveal a hiring plan for short-term labor by the employer that was anything but occasional and unpredictable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Concluding that the employer was not an employer covered by the Act, the court set the award aside.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona), which convicted her of four kidnappings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the perpetrator entered the victims' home in an attempt to steal drugs. They forced the victims' to move about within the house and tied them up. The defense was duress, but defendant testified that she had not attempted to escape from the crime scene, the perpetrator had twice given her his gun, she returned it to him, and she admitted to a police officer that she assisted the perpetrator because she was stupid. The appellate court found that: (1) because the absence of duress was not an element of kidnapping, the legislature could constitutionally impose upon the defendant the burden of proving it; (2) refusal to give a jury instruction that erroneously treated lack of duress as an element of the crime was not an abuse of discretion; (3) refusal to permit evidence of the perpetrator's previous suicide attempt was harmless error, because of the overwhelming evidence of guilt and lack of duress; and (4) refusal to grant a mistrial based on the bullet was not an abuse of discretion, as the trial court gave a cautionary instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, appellants, a ranch and a land investment company, appealed rulings of the Pinal County Superior Court, Arizona, denying their requests for declaratory and injunctive relief against placing two referenda, both initiated by appellee proponent, on the November 2002 general election ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue the instant court addressed was when, for purposes of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-142, did the 30-day time period commence for filing a referendum petition challenging a county rezoning ordinance: (1) when the ordinance was enacted and executed by a county board of supervisors; or (2) only later, when the county's elections director obtained the ordinance and provided it to the proponent. Appellants argued that the referendum petitions had not been timely filed, while the proponent contended otherwise. The instant court held that the referendum petitions were untimely filed were void. It found untenable the proponent's argument that a duly enacted and executed county ordinance was not available for purposes of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-142(C), (D), unless and until the county elections director obtained a copy of the ordinance and provided it to the proponent. The ordinances were legally available upon their enactment. The proponent's reliance on inaccurate advice from the county elections director did not extend the time period for filing the petitions or otherwise excuse noncompliance with the statutory requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's rulings in both cases were vacated. Because the proponent's referendum petitions in both cases were untimely filed and were void, the instant court directed entry of judgment in favor of appellants on their complaints. The instant court denied the investment company's request for an award of attorney's fees in both the trial court and on appeal pursuant to the private attorney general doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father appealed the order of the Superior Court in Yavapai County (Arizona) that he pay appellee mother $ 484 per month in child support. He also appealed the court's failure to allocate the federal tax exemption for the parties' minor child. In calculating the father's gross income for child support purposes, the court imputed additional income to the father based on his previous 80-hour workweek.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not articulate any reasons for attributing 16 additional hours to the father's weekly schedule. Interpreting the applicable sections of the Arizona Child Support Guidelines, Appendix to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-320 (1996), the appellate court concluded that the phrase &quot;full-time employment&quot; could have encompassed more than 40 hours per week, if part of a regular schedule. The appellate court further concluded, however, that, because the father was not working below &quot;full earning capacity&quot; at the time of trial, the trial court erred by attributing additional income to him based on the 80-hour workweek he once worked. The trial court also erred by failing to allocate the tax exemption. However, the appellate court refused to construe Guideline 4(a) as imposing an hourly limitation of 40 hours per week on the amount of earned income generated from full-time hourly employment, because that construction would have fostered a situation in which children of parents with comparable gross incomes would have received inconsistent child support awards depending on the parent's type of employment rather than ability to pay, a result unfair to children and parents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's child support order was vacated, and the case was remanded for proceedings consistent with the appellate opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician was certified to perform both general and thoracic surgery. A patient filed a complaint with the board, the gist of which was that the physician had failed to take proper diagnostic measures when treating her for a condition that the a clinic three months later diagnosed as cancer. She also alleged that the physician's office had refused to provide her copies of her medical records. The board scheduled an interview with the physician, who appeared without counsel. The board then censured the physician, who appealed the decision. The decision was ultimately remanded. Upon remand, the physician once again challenged the decision to censure him. The court of appeals held that the board failed to provide due process of law, and the physician was entitled to a new hearing that satisfied the requirements of due process. Upon remand, if the board undertook to establish that the physician's conduct was negligent, and thus unprofessional under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1401(25)(11), it must establish a deviation from an articulated standard of professional care, establish that the deviation resulted in actual harm, and provide reviewable findings on both points.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court Of Pima County (Arizona) sentenced him to concurrent terms for the drug offenses and a consecutive term for weapon charge. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that: (1) the trial court improperly permitted a witness to refer to the fact that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent; and (2) his convictions for both the drug offenses and for possession of a deadly weapon during a felony drug offense violated federal and state double jeopardy principles and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-116. The appellate court held that because the officer here did not state or imply that defendant had invoked his right to remain silent, the trial court did not commit error, much less fundamental error. Because defendant's convictions occurred in a single trial, the appellate court was only concerned with the prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense. With the exception of possession of drug paraphernalia, the drug offenses were greater offenses than the weapons offense by reason of felony classification. As a result, the weapons offense was not a lesser-included offense as defendant claimed and there was no violation of double jeopardy principles. The statutory provisions were not composed of the same elements, and were not the same offense. The consecutive sentences were permissible under &sect; 13-116.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought special action review of the decision of the Maricopa County Superior Court (Arizona) that upheld a provision of the Citizens Clean Elections Act (Act), which permitted certain fine surcharges to be distributed to political candidates, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-954(C) (Supp. 2001). Petitioner received a parking ticket and was fined $ 27, which included a 10 percent surcharge pursuant to the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act established a system of campaign finance whereby certain candidates could receive campaign funds in exchange for agreeing to limit campaign contributions and expenditures. The appellate court held that, based on the Supreme Court holdings of Buckley, Abood, Keller, and United Foods, &sect; 16-954(C), the authorization of a surcharge on civil and criminal fines to finance state elections, imposed an unconstitutional restraint on the exercise of free speech. In the case at bar there was no compelling interest to promote speech when the individuals paying the surcharge and the political speech they funded had no connection. The appellate court found the surcharge was more akin to a regulatory fee than to a general tax because it was imposed upon a specific group of individuals, placed in a special fund, and geared toward a specific purpose: political campaigns. The participating politicians directly benefit from the funds. The surcharge created an involuntary association of those forced to pay the surcharges, and the speech that was being supported was not germane to the purpose of the association. The secretary of state and treasurer were enjoined from enforcing &sect; 16-954(C).</SPAN></P>

ADOR argued in its cross-appeal that its assessment properly encompassed the railroad's entire gross receipts from transportation services between Clifton and smelters in Arizona, and that the tax court erred by holding otherwise. ADOR contended that non-apportionment of taxes on these gross receipts did not unduly burden interstate commerce and that the railroad failed to establish that any portion of those receipts was subject to multiple taxation. The appellate court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-5062(A) could not constitutionally be applied to tax the railroad's gross receipts from shipping goods from Clifton to other points in Arizona via connections in Lordsburg, New Mexico. Neither Arizona statutory law nor Arizona case law provided authorization for allocating gross receipts from the transportation business between services performed within and without Arizona.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant had pled guilty to solicitation to possess narcotics, the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, placed defendant on mandatory probation pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-901.01. The State then filed a petition to revoke defendant's probation, alleging probation violations. Defendant informed the trial court that he wished to reject probation, which the trial court allowed him to do. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a condition of probation, defendant was to serve a 60-day jail term, to be determined later. When the trial court accepted defendant's rejection of probation after he was found to be in violation, the State argued that the trial court should at least impose the 60-day jail term. The trial court disagreed, terminated defendant's probation unsuccessfully, and released defendant from custody. At issue on appeal was whether a defendant, who had violated his probation under Proposition 200, 1997 Ariz. Sess. Laws 2897, could then choose to reject any further probation. The appellate court held, in accordance with Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-901.01(E) (2001), that such a defendant could not reject probation, and the trial court was required to continue the defendant on probation and impose appropriate additional conditions. The trial court erred by accepting defendant's rejection of probation and by terminating his probation as unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated the order terminating defendant's probation, and remanded the matter to the trial court to reinstate probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner flood control district (FCD) sought special action relief from the denial by the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) of its motion for summary judgment on a counterclaim filed by real parties in interest (RPIs). The controlling issue was whether the period within which an inverse condemnation action must be commenced after accrual was the one-year period for actions against public entities, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-821 (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relying on &sect; 12-821, FCD contended that the RPIs' counterclaim was time-barred, as it was not brought within one year of accrual. The counterclaim was filed December 31, 1998. If the one-year limitations period of &sect; 12-821 applied to inverse condemnation actions, then the counterclaim was time-barred, if it accrued before December 31, 1997. RPIs contended that the applicable limitations period was the 10-year period for commencing an action to recover lands in the possession of another.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-526(A). According to the RPIs, the 10-year period was mandated by the Arizona Supreme Court's decision in Water District. The appellate court concluded that the RPIs' reliance on Water District was misplaced and that &sect; 12-821's one-year limitations period was reasonable, as it regulated, rather than abrogated, the time within which an action had to be filed against a public entity. Section 12-281 (in its present form) was relatively new, and the issue presented was one of first impression. Section 12-821, which barred all actions against the state or its political subdivisions not brought within one year of when the cause of action accrued, superceded Water District.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee and the beneficiary were beneficiaries of two trusts, their aunt's and their mother's. After their mother's death, the trustee filed a civil complaint against the beneficiary for his alleged financial exploitation of their mother. Inter alia, she sought an order forfeiting the beneficiary's inheritance from both trusts. The probate court directed her to distribute the trust funds unless she obtained a provisional remedy in the civil action that allowed her to hold the funds until resolution of that matter. The motion for a provisional remedy in the civil action was denied however the court released the trustee from any liability resulting from her trusteeship. The beneficiary asserted that the provision contravened his statutory right to bring an action against the trustee six months from the date of the final accounting under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-7306(B), 14-7307 (1995). The appellate court held that the statutes did not restrict a court's ability to release a trustee and the evidentiary hearing on the petition was the beneficiary's opportunity to litigate those issues. Approval of the trust's payment of fees to its attorney was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Based on State v. Berge, 130 Ariz. 135, 634 P.2d 947 (1981), the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) granted appellee's motion to suppress evidence seized from his home, finding invalid the warrant that authorized the search. The state dismissed the case and appealed pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4032.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">U.S. Customs &quot;sniffer&quot; dogs alerted to a package from Amsterdam that was addressed to appellee. The package contained a little over two pounds of hashish. Other than the package, the officers had no information suggesting that appellee unlawfully possessed drugs or was involved in drug-related activities. The package was delivered several days after a warrant was issued. The warrant was executed, and in searching the residence, officers found paraphernalia for growing marijuana, hallucinogenic mushrooms, and a pound of marijuana. They also found the unopened package of hashish. Challenging the trial court's order granting appellee's motion to suppress, the state contended that, inter alia, Berge was no longer good law in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983), and case law from other jurisdictions, both federal and state, decided since Gates. The appellate court conceded that some of the cases were persuasive. But the state's supreme court reached a different result in Berge. Having concluded that Berge remained good law in Arizona notwithstanding Gates, the appellate court was compelled to follow it.</SPAN></P>

Instead of using an attorney obtained by the county attorney, the sheriff directed an administrative employee, who was also a licensed attorney, to represent him in the appeal. The sheriff contended that the county board of supervisors (Board) possessed the authority to employ counsel in that manner and delegated it to him by ratifying a merit system rule, which he claimed permitted an agency to choose its own counsel in appeals to the commission. The appellate court held that the rule allowed only employees who brought a claim before the commission to represent themselves or secure lay or legal representation in appeals. Absent authorization by the board, county officials had to use counsel obtained by the county attorney to represent their interests in commission appeals. Neither the board nor the county attorney authorized the sheriff to use the administrative employee as counsel before the commission in the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The Maricopa County Superior Court, Arizona, committed her to the jurisdiction of the psychiatric security review board (PSRB) pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3994 (2001). Petitioner sought review, arguing that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues on appeal were whether Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3994(A), (F), and (G) (2001) required a mandatory 120-day period of confinement, and if so, whether a 120-day confinement period was constitutional. The appellate court held the statute was constitutional, but did not reach the issue of whether an initial 120-day confinement, without the prospect of release, for a GEI defendant guilty of a crime involving death or serious physical injury, would or would not be constitutional. Petitioner claimed that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3994 violated her due process rights because it did not allow her or anyone else to seek a release hearing on her behalf prior to the expiration of the initial 120-day confinement period. The State contended that although the legislature chose to prohibit the defendant from requesting a release hearing within the first 120 days, it did not intend to limit the medical director's ability to request a hearing. The appellate court concluded that the statute allowed the medical director to request a release hearing within the 120-day period referenced and did not preclude the medical director from requesting a release hearing at any time.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that realistically, service of process on counsel in a case such as the one at bar may not have in fact apprised a parent such as the mother of the pendency of termination proceedings, but, nonetheless, it was a means reasonably calculated under the circumstances to notify the parent and to protect her rights, as opposed to attempted service on a person who disappeared or service by publication. The court did not find the application of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-863 and Ariz. R. Civ. P. 5(c)(1) to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the specific intent required by the offense could be shown through direct or circumstantial evidence. The offense of exhibition of speed went beyond the mere speed that a person was traveling; it also prohibited the quick acceleration of a vehicle for the purpose of drawing public attention to the swiftness of one's vehicle. There was no constitutional infirmity with respect to the portion of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-708(A) criminalizing an exhibition of speed or acceleration on a street or highway.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not err in not permitting defendant to cross-examine the victim regarding the specific nature of the victim's prior felony conviction. Evidence that the witness had been convicted of a felony was to be admitted if the court determined that the probative value of admitting the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. That the court did not admit evidence of the nature of the prior conviction did not damage defendant's ability to argue that the victim was not credible. The trial court's instruction on criminal street gangs said &quot;any criminal act&quot; when it should have said &quot;any felony act.&quot; This error was harmless. No reasonable possibility existed that the jury based its criminal street gang decision on crimes other than felonies. The trial court clearly erred when it found the Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604.02(B) allegation proved, for the record reflected no evidence to support the allegation. The error was not harmless. A jury trial was not required on the Ariz. Rev.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1101(1) (2000), was unconstitutionally vague, as it failed to adequately distinguish first-degree murder from second-degree murder and thus allowed for arbitrary and discriminatory application of the statute. The appellate court found that the statute, as applied to the defendant, resulted in harmless error and affirmed. In a prior case, the court determined that the statute, while constitutional on its face, was unconstitutionally vague because of the judicial construction of the statute by the Arizona Supreme Court to the effect that premeditation could be &quot;as instantaneous as successive thoughts of the mind.&quot; The court found however that the offending &quot;instantaneous&quot; language was not introduced into the case in any way, and the defendant was convicted solely using the constitutional portion of the statute. Therefore, the defendant was not prejudiced by the application of a vague statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by indictment with possessing a dangerous drug for sale and possessing marijuana for sale. Defendant requested a bifurcated trial. Petitioner, State, filed an allegation of serious drug offense (significant source of income) pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3410(A). The respondent judge found &sect; 13-3410(A)&nbsp;unconstitutional and dismissed the allegation. The State challenged that ruling in a special action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that based on the transcript of the hearing below and the ultimate dismissal of the allegation, it appeared likely that the respondent judge found &sect; 13-3410(A)&nbsp;unconstitutional based on the grand jury issue raised in defendant's motion; that the state could pursue the serious drug offense allegation only by way of a grand jury indictment and not merely by filing an allegation, as the state had done. That motion was based strictly on a purported similarity between &sect; 13-3410(A) and the federal crime of continuing criminal enterprise (CCE), 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 848. An indictment or information could not be brought against an accused under &sect; 13-3410 unless that person had already been convicted of &quot;a serious drug offense.&quot; The court found no constitutional infirmity in the legislature's enactment of &sect; 13-10 to define not a substantive offense but, rather, an enhanced penalty for conviction of serious drug offenses when additional facts were proven. Those facts need not be alleged in the charging document provided that the notice of them given the defendant comported with Arizona's traditional notice requirements for alleging sentence enhancements.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that: (1) the statutory definition of premeditation, as judicially construed, lacked sufficient specificity to provide an adequate standard by which a fact-finder could differentiate between the two degrees of murder, and the appellate court concluded that the statute was void for vagueness; and (2) defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed because the defect in the statute did not infect the proceedings against defendant as he was unable to show prejudice or harm.</SPAN></P>

The employee failed to overcome the presumption that she had at-will employment status. The policy manual did not satisfy the statutory prerequisites for maintaining a viable action for breach of contract under the EPA. The manual clearly confirmed the at-will status of all employees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Scottsdale, Ariz., Rev. Code &sect; 18-11 was unconstitutional because it contained a mandatory presumption that shifted the burden of proof from the State to the defense. The pertinent language in Scottsdale, Ariz., Rev.

It relieved the prosecution of the burden of proving an element of the offense: that the owner of record was also the person in control of the property and therefore liable for the violations. The ordinance created a mandatory evidentiary presumption that impermissibly removed the burden of proof from the State in violation of due process. The ordinance was therefore facially invalid and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court had no basis for questioning the trial court's reasons for vacating its prior order. However, the trial court's ultimate ruling that the issue of grandparent visitation was left in the discretion of the mother was vacated. The court was unable to conclude as a matter of law that the grandparents did not carry their burden of rebutting the presumption of parental primacy or could not do so if given the opportunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that Ariz. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 13-3401, which defined &quot;dangerous drug&quot; to include gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), it nonetheless failed to give him notice that his action, i.e., ingesting gamma butyrolactone (GBL) was illegal. The defendant ingested GBL, a legal product, purchased in fact from a health-food store, without knowledge or notice that it would be converted in his body to its proscribed metabolite GHB. The court on appeal held that there was nothing facially vague about Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1381(A)(3) but when applied to these facts it was void for vagueness. The defendant could not be held strictly liable for violating &sect; 28-1381(A)(3) when, through a bodily process unknown to a person of average intelligence and common experience, that substance would be transformed into a prohibited substance. The fact that a violation of &sect; 28-1381(A)(3) was a strict liability offense also influenced the court's determination that the statute failed to give defendant adequate notice such as to fulfill the requirements of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' billboard was a non-conforming sign under Tempe, Ariz., Ordinance 808. The city filed a declaratory action contending that repairs made to the billboard exceeded the permissible scope of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-462.02 and the ordinance. The ordinance's blanket prohibition against making any alterations to non-conforming signs could not be interpreted in harmony with the opposite mandate of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-462.02(A). Because the statute controlled over the ordinance, the conflicting language of the ordinance was invalid. The repairs fell within the permissible parameters of Ariz. Rev.

An alien couple challenged the statutes as violative of equal protection. The appeals court held that the statutes were subject to strict scrutiny, because the absence of a five-year moratorium made them more restrictive than federal laws.

Stat. &sect; 13-604(R), for a total of five and one-half years in prison. The defendant appealed the sentences imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the sentences imposed violated the Apprendi doctrine. Under Apprendi, it was unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increased the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant was exposed. Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum was required to be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court held that absent waiver, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was on pretrial release and a jury had to so determine before a sentence could be enhanced pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604(R) (2001). The additional finding by the trial court that the defendant was on release status exposed the defendant to a maximum sentence on each count which exceeded the statutory maximum for the offense. Therefore, the plain language in Apprendi required that the defendant's release status be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court held the proper remedy was a remand for a new trial on the enhancement issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence enhancements were vacated. Because the State was not at fault for the need for a retrial, the case was remand for a new trial on the sentence enhancement issue.</SPAN></P>

Two juveniles argued that these statutes violated the separation of powers doctrine. The legislature did not exceed its constitutional authority by empowering the executive branch to select which sentencing scheme the court could use to punish a juvenile offender. The prosecutor's decision did not curtail the exercise of a court's discretion in choosing an appropriate punishment from among the legislatively authorized options. The legislature has not relinquished its power to decide the range of punishment available to the court. These statutes did not violate the separation of powers doctrine, or did they deprive petitioners of their due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The statute that the juvenile had pled guilty to was declared unconstitutional. The Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, vacated the judgment of delinquency, probation violation, and original plea agreement, and reinstated the charges that were previously dismissed. Upon reconsideration the superior court vacated the reinstatement of the previously dismissed charges. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>

The plea agreement contained a provision that if one of the parties was allowed to get out of the agreement, then the juvenile would again be considered accused of all the charges originally in the petition and any charges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. The appellate court found that the juvenile court erred in its decision of the motion for reconsideration because when the juvenile court granted defendant's motion to vacate his delinquency adjudication, it permitted him to withdraw from an agreement that he had not completely performed, and that triggered the provision in the plea agreement that reinstated all of the charges that were dismissed in the plea agreement.</SPAN></P>

Appellee political parties intervened to challenge the constitutionality of statutes governing the selection of party leadership. The Maricopa County (Arizona) Superior Court entered judgment for the non-conforming faction, and the conforming faction appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the challenged statutes,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 16-824 to 828 (1996), governing the selection of party leadership, were constitutional, but that the non-conforming faction needed to comply with them only prospectively. The appellate court held that because adherence to the challenged statutes was mandatory, not permissive, it could not avoid deciding whether the statutes were constitutional. The challenged statutes did not restrict the ability of political parties and their members to endorse, support, or vote for particular persons; they did not limit a party's access to the ballot; they did not determine a party's policy; and, while they affected a party's structure for some purposes, they did not regulate a party's internal governance. Therefore, they did not unconstitutionally burden associational rights under the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, but rather served the state's important regulatory interests. However, as the challenged statutes were passed in 1979, the non-conforming faction was aware of the law and the trial court erred in excusing it from complying with those statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That portion of the judgment upholding the constitutionality of the challenged statutes was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute prohibited state funding of abortions unless it was necessary to save the mother's life.

The court of appeals held that the statute was not unconstitutional because: (1) there was nothing to suggest that the framers of the constitution intended the right to privacy under the state constitution to create a right of citizens to subsidized abortions to which they were not entitled under the United States Constitution, even if state citizens had a greater right to privacy under the state constitution; (2) the statute did not discriminate on the basis of sex, nor did the classification impinge upon the exercise of a fundamental right, and the statutory scheme was rationally related to a legitimate government purpose; and (3) eligible individuals were not special or exclusive simply because the state did not provide medically necessary abortions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Pima County Superior Court (Arizona), which convicted defendant of first degree murder and sentenced him to a prison term of natural life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred by failing to apply the special sentencing procedures in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703 to determine whether to impose natural life or a life sentence with the possibility of release in 25 years, and by considering natural life the presumptive sentence for first degree murder. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred by considering natural life in prison the &quot;presumptive&quot; sentence under &sect; 13-703. The instant court found no reversible error regarding the conviction. However, because the trial court stated that natural life was the &quot;presumptive&quot; sentence for first degree murder, the instant court remanded for further proceedings regarding the sentence. The trial court's oral pronouncement of sentence did not mention the term &quot;presumptive&quot; but it did not negate the possibility that the trial court believed that the natural life term was to be imposed in the vast majority of such cases in the absence of an imbalance between mitigating and aggravating factors. If this were true, the trial court might have exercised its sentencing discretion improperly. Only the trial court could clarify its intent and correct the record if necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, but it remanded to the trial court for a period of 14 days so that it could clarify the ambiguity created by the use of the term &quot;presumptive&quot; in the sentencing minute entry and, if appropriate, make any necessary corrections, or, if necessary, order that it would resentence defendant without considering the natural life sentence the presumptive sentence.</SPAN></P>

She contended the ordinance constituted class legislation at its worst and unconstitutionally discriminated against her because it selectively applied only to restaurants, while excluding bars and bowling alleys. The owner did not claim to be a member of any suspect class and the law did not recognize any fundamental, constitutionally protected right to smoke in the same area in which one chose to eat. The appellate court had no difficulty concluding that the ordinance was rationally and reasonably related to furthering some legitimate governmental interest. Significant scientific evidence suggested that smoking or exposure to second-hand smoke posed serious and substantial health risks. The ordinance was a reasonable, legitimate means of safeguarding the general health, safety, and welfare of the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alleged that Ariz. Rev.

Appellant also alleged that the State failed to prove that he had uttered a &quot;true threat&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 13-1202(A)(1). The appellate court affirmed the delinquency adjudication. Section 13-1202(A)(1) did not require the State to prove that an accused acted with &quot;wrongful intent&quot; by threatening to cause physical injury to another or seriously damage property. However, one violated &sect; 13-1202(A)(1) only by communicating a &quot;true threat.&quot; An accused expressed such a threat if, under the circumstances, a reasonable person would have foreseen that his words would have been taken as a serious expression of an intent to inflict bodily harm, and his statements were not the result of mistake, duress, or coercion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applied for a managed underground water storage facility permit.

Appellee corporation claimed that the section of the riverbed running through its property was its private property and could not be disturbed. The instant court held that the consent of streambed owners was not required before appellant could make beneficial use of an existing natural watercourse to move its appropriated water and for water storage purposes pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45-811.01 (1994 &amp; Supp. 2000). Appellee corporation's title to the land adjacent to the Hassayampa River was taken subject to existing water rights. Appellant's proposed diversion of CAP water was not a taking. The trial court's interpretation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45-173(A) (1994 &amp; Supp. 2000) and Ariz. Rev.

He appealed, arguing that the Arizona filing deadline for independent presidential candidates was unconstitutional because it unfairly and unnecessarily burdened independent candidates such as himself. The appellate court reversed. Mootness presented no reason to avoid the issues raised.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-341 (Supp. 2000) was deemed unconstitutional. The June 14 deadline imposed on independent candidates by &sect; 16-341 impermissibly burdened the association rights of independent voters.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant suffered a compensable industrial injury while working for an uninsured employer. Respondent approved a settlement between claimant and respondent's special fund stipulating that claimant was entitled to $ 560 a month for permanent partial disability. Subsequently, claimant was convicted of several felonies and sentenced to prison. The special fund suspended claimant's disability compensation. Appellant, claimant's wife, filed for divorce and requested that the trial court order claimant to pay a reasonable sum from his workers' compensation award for child support. The trial court issued an order of assignment directing claimant's &quot;other payors&quot; to send the amount of $ 560 per month to the court clerk. The trial court's judgment found that the special fund was in compliance with the order of assignment by paying 50 percent of claimant's compensation benefits for child support. However, the instant court concluded that because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-1131(C) did not apply to claimant's benefits, the special fund was obligated to pay the full $ 560 for child support unless and until claimant successfully moved to modify the order of support and the order of assignment.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 13-205(A) (West Supp. 2000), the affirmative defense statute, violated the Due Process Clause of the Arizona Constitution because it relieved the State of the burden imposed on it by the Due Process Clause to disprove the justification defense beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court rejected appellant's constitutional challenge to &sect; 13-205(A) because appellant failed to demonstrate that the Due Process Clause of the Arizona Constitution, unlike its federal counterpart, prohibited the State from placing the burden of proving the affirmative defense of justification on a criminal defendant. Appellant also argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the use of deadly force in defense of a third person. The appellate court found that a portion of the instruction subtly misstated the standard for the use of deadly physical force by impermissibly suggesting that only actual deadly force, and not apparent deadly force, could justify appellant's use of deadly force.

Even though only one-third of the property was listed as a single parcel in the records of the county assessor's office, appellant's residential use of the property rendered the entire parcel a &quot;developed&quot; parcel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a proceeding regarding the validity of the incorporation of appellant town, a preliminary injunction was entered prohibiting appellant from exercising governmental authority, including incurring attorneys' fees. Nearly two years later, appellant moved to modify the preliminary injunction to be allowed to incurring attorneys' fees. The Superior Court, Pima County (Arizona) refused to grant the modification, and appellant town appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, appellant maintained that the trial court erred in refusing to modify the preliminary injunction and allow the appellant to obligate itself to pay an attorney. Appellant claimed that due process allowed it to pay an attorney even if its incorporation was found to be invalid. The court rejected appellant's arguments. The court held that no violation of the appellant's alleged due process rights occurred. Appellant's due process argument was not within the scope of a motion to modify a preliminary injunction. It did not stem from new legal or factual issues affecting the continuing propriety of the preliminary injunction but required a reexamination of the bases of the original ruling. Additionally, U.S. Const. amend. XIV applies to persons, not municipalities, and, therefore, the appellant had no Fourteenth Amendment right to assert. The court was satisfied that the appellant was and would continue to be adequately represented. Appellant's attorney provided representation for it in 13 separate lawsuits, and appellant took no action for nearly two years to obtain any relief from the restraint on its acquisition of debt for attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city refused to consent to allowing defendants to incorporate into new municipal corporations, as provided by state law. Defendants challenged the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-101.01(1966), which required plaintiff's consent. The court found the statute was constitutional because it did not violate equal protection, procedural or substantive due process, the right to self-determination or the First Amendment, nor did it have an adverse impact on the right to vote. There was no constitutional right to vote for municipal incorporation. Ariz. Const. art. 13, &sect; 1, gave the legislature plenary power over the methods and procedures for municipal incorporation. The Arizona legislature granted the right to petition and vote for incorporation, but made an election contingent upon the consent of a neighboring municipality. Protecting the interests of existing cities concerning the formation of new political subdivisions, bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After two plaintiffs sustained industrial injuries, their employers' workers' compensation carriers, defendant insurers, accepted plaintiffs' claims and paid them benefits.

Plaintiffs then made claims against defendants for their share of what defendants received. Defendants refused to pay, and plaintiffs filed declaratory relief actions. The trial courts granted defendants' motions for summary judgment, and plaintiffs appealed. The appellate court agreed with the trial courts that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1023(C) did not permit an order compelling a workers' compensation lienholder to pay, from the amount it was paid on account of its statutorily prescribed lien, an equitable share of the attorney's fees and costs incurred by the plaintiffs in a third-party tort action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a special action, plaintiffs appealed a judgment of the Maricopa County Superior Court (Arizona), which denied their challenge to a City of Mesa zoning referendum and denied their motion for new trial and to amend the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought to compel defendant city clerk to disqualify invalid signatures on a referendum attempting to overturn a zoning change on two grounds: first, because the attachment of a zoning map to the petition was insufficient to meet the requirement of a &quot;legal description&quot; of the property pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-121(E); and second, because petition signatures obtained by nonresidents of Mesa were invalid pursuant to state and local laws. The instant court agreed with the trial court that the requirement of a legal description was met by the inclusion of a particular zoning map authorized by the Mesa zoning code and attached to the petition. Nothing inherent in the context of &sect; 19-121(E) required a &quot;legal description&quot; to be interpreted to mean a hypertechnical recitation of property boundaries having no meaning or relevance to the citizens considering the petition. The trial court also properly rejected the challenge to the validity of the referendum petitions based on the Mesa nonresidency of circulators who were otherwise qualified to register to vote in Arizona, as a local residency requirement for petition circulators would have been unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The requirement of a legal description was met by the inclusion of a particular zoning map authorized by the city's zoning code and attached to the referendum petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to five counts of child molestation and one count of sexual abuse and was sentenced to prison. Appellant was required to serve at least two-thirds of his sentence before becoming eligible for release. Prior to his prison release, he was screened to determine his status as a sexually violent person. The screening psychologist opined that he suffered from a paraphilia that predisposed him to commit sexual acts to such a degree as to render him a danger to the health and safety of others and that made him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence. A jury found that appellant was a sexually violent person, and the trial court ordered appellant to be civilly committed to the state hospital. The appellate court reversed. Application of the Sexually Violent Persons Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-3701 through 36-3716 (Supp. 2000), to appellant was a collateral rather than direct consequence of his guilty plea; therefore he need not have been informed of this prospect at the time of his plea. However, the appellate court held that the act was unconstitutional, because the act did not require volitional impairment; thus it escaped a saving interpretation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporations operating multi-location businesses throughout Arizona brought an action challenging appellee counties' decisions that appellants were entitled pursuant to Ariz.

The appellate court was to interpret the term &quot;taxpayer&quot; in &sect; 42-280 so that it conformed to the grant of authority set forth in Ariz. Const. art. 9, &sect; 2(6). The term &quot;taxpayer&quot; in art. 9, &sect; 2(6) and &sect; 42-280 plainly referred to a person or entity that owned personal property used for agricultural, trade, or business purposes and who paid tax on such property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in a drive-by gang-related shooting. The jury convicted appellant of all charges. Seeking review, appellant argued that the trial court improperly permitted the prosecutor to use a peremptory strike to remove a juror based on religion in violation of Batson and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 12. Appellant contended that by referring to the Pope and the Bishop in his reasons for seeking to strike that juror, the prosecutor had proffered a theory according to which no Roman Catholic could sit on a case in which the death penalty was being sought. The court affirmed, holding that although the juror's religious views were intertwined with other factors, including her employment by the Catholic Diocese, her religious membership was not the basis for striking her from the jury panel, and her opposition to capital punishment was a legitimate basis for exercising a peremptory strike.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the juror in question was dismissed because her opinions may have prevented her from impartially applying the law, not because of her membership in the Catholic Church. The court remanded the conviction for misconduct involving weapons for resentencing, because the jury never made the required finding of dangerousness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee had been judicially granted visitation with her grandchildren under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-409. Appellant wife's new husband petitioned to adopt the children, and the trial court granted appellee's petition for continuation of visitation. Appellant husband was allowed to adopt the children, and appellants petitioned to terminate appellee's visitation. The petition was denied by the trial court, and appellants sought review. Section 25-409 did not unconstitutionally infringe upon a parent's right to control the rearing of their child, was rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in fostering relationships between grandparents and grandchildren, and did not violate due process because it gave weight to the visitation decisions of the child's parent. The statute superseded the statute providing that, upon adoption, the adopting parent would have the same relationship with the child as if the child were born to that parent in lawful wedlock. The statute did not offend equal protection when it provided that all visitation would terminate upon the child's adoption but provided an exemption to this in the case of a stepparent adoption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was affirmed because the statute allowing appellee to continue to have visitation with appellants' children after the children's adoption by appellant father was constitutional, superseded the statute giving an adopting parent the rights of a natural parent, and did not impermissibly distinguish between two-parent adoptions and stepparent adoptions.</SPAN></P>

Appellee moved for dismissal, claiming the action was barred by the one-year statute of limitations in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-541. The trial court granted the motion, and this appeal followed. The court reviewed de novo the trial court's dismissal based on its application of a statute of limitations. Because appellant based her cause of action, in part, on that common law liability, the one-year statute of limitations in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-541(5) did not apply. The court therefore concluded that the two-year statute of limitations in Ariz. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of stalking, threats and intimidation, criminal damage, attempted aggravated assault, and aggravated assault. Appellant sought review, arguing that the stalking statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the stalking statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2923, was unconstitutionally vague because it designated essentially the same proscribed conduct as both a class 3 felony and a class 5 felony. The court therefore reduced the stalking conviction to a class 5 felony, and remanded for resentencing. The court also remanded for a hearing to determine whether appellant was aware of the consequences when he admitted at his sentencing hearing to having prior felony convictions and to having committed the instant offenses while on release. The court affirmed the remaining felony convictions, and also held that the misdemeanor charges were properly decided by the jury. Finally, the fact that appellant was shot while committing one of the offenses was not a mitigating factor.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1595(B); and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1595(B) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was stopped by a Phoenix police officer for making a left turn without using a proper turn signal. He had no driver's license, nor could he provide documentary identification. The statute did not expressly state whether evidence of identity needed to be documentary or whether verbal evidence could suffice. The court found the legislature required that an unlicensed operator's &quot;evidence of identity&quot; contain the operator's name, date of birth, address, physical description, and signature. The legislature was demonstrably attempting to require an operator who lacked a driver's license to provide a source of functionally equivalent identification. The court found appellant's argument that an operator could satisfy the statutory requirement by answering a series of questions and providing a signature made literal but not common sense. The statute contemplated a single, tangible, documentary piece of evidence whose contents satisfied the entire statutory list. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1595(B) was sufficiently definite to provide notice to Arizona drivers that they must carry evidence of identity in a form comparable in content and reliability to a driver's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Evidence of identity needed to be documentary not verbal when motorist was stopped by police. Uncorroborated verbal responses did not satisfy the concern to provide a source of verification of driver's identity. Because a person of ordinary intelligence could understand the identification requirement, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Phoenix police officer responded to a call of shots fired near a canal. Upon a search of the area, the officer encountered appellant on a street walking from the direction of the canal.

Appellant was arrested and charged with violating, inter alia, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3111 (Supp. 1999). Appellant moved for dismissal based on an opinion from Division Two of the court of appeals holding that &sect; 13-3111 was unconstitutional.

The limitation of the statute's application only to counties with a population of more than 500,000 persons was palpably arbitrary. The appellate court remanded for a new disposition, concluding that commitment to the Arizona Department of Juvenile Corrections would not have been unwarranted in this case, as appellant had been a member of a gang since the age of 11 and was heavily entrenched in the gang culture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Adjudication vacated and case remanded to the juvenile court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion. Limitation of statutory provision prohibiting minors from carrying or possessing firearms only to counties with a population of more than 500,000 persons was palpably arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a sex offender on probation, claimed the Superior Court in Yuma County (Arizona) erred in revoking his probation. He claimed the probation conditions violated U.S. Const. amend. I and denied him equal protection, and that the revocation of his probation violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was a participant in a sex offender supervision program. His probation was revoked because he initiated, established, and maintained contact with minors. He claimed that the probation regulations were overbroad and that they violated his constitutional rights. A reasonable relationship clearly existed between the requirement that appellant not have unsupervised contact with children and the goals of rehabilitation and protecting the public. There was no evidence of selective enforcement of regulations. State's alleged failure to pursue all violations was not a sufficient basis for a successful equal protection claim. Appellant's claim that it was fundamentally unfair for the trial court to conclude that he violated his probation when he had received permission to attend the retreat was rejected. Petition to revoke was premised on specific acts committed on the retreat.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Reasonable relationship existed between regulations and probationary goals. Appellant did not show that regulations were enforced in a discriminatory manner. There was no fundamental unfairness; revocation was based on specific acts that were not authorized as part of retreat.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted after being found in a methamphetamine laboratory and having a glass pipe found in his apartment. He appealed, contending that his convictions for possession of chemicals and equipment for the purpose of manufacturing methamphetamine and for possession of drug paraphernalia were lesser-included offenses of manufacturing methamphetamine. On appeal, the court vacated appellant's possession of chemicals and equipment conviction because it was a lesser-included offense of manufacturing methamphetamine because appellant could not have committed the offense of manufacturing methamphetamine under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3407(A)(4) without possessing the chemicals and equipment to do so under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3407(A)(3). However, the appellate court affirmed appellant's possession of drug paraphernalia conviction, as it was not a lesser-included offense, because the drug paraphernalia offense under Ariz. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State appealed from a declaratory judgment by the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona), which held that the Consumer Lenders Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-601 to -638 (1999), did not apply to appellee company. Appellant State also appealed the trial court's dismissal of its counterclaim and denial of its request for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee company provided money to customers in the form of a sale and lease-back transaction which required the customer to transfer title to his or her vehicle to the company and the company would have leased the vehicle back to the customer.

Appellant State counterclaimed and alleged the transactions were usurious under the Consumer Lenders Act. The trial court concluded the transactions were not consumer loans within the meaning of the Consumer Lenders Act and that appellees had effectively shut down all operations shortly after the counterclaim was filed. The court concluded that appellees' transactions were consumer loans in which vehicle title transfers served as security devices, and not bona fide sales.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of the trial court's summary dismissal of his petition for post-conviction relief. Petitioner claimed that he had rejected a favorable plea agreement because his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to properly explain the relative merits of the plea offer in comparison with the potential sentence that he faced if convicted of the charges. The court held, first, that petitioner suffered a constitutionally significant injury when he rejected the favorable plea agreement as a result of his counsel's ineffective assistance. Second, petitioner's rejection of the favorable plea agreement was not relieved by his receipt of a fair trial. Third, the trial court could, without violating separation of powers, fashion a remedy for the deprivation of petitioner's right to effective assistance, including, if warranted under the circumstances, ordering respondent to reinstate the original plea offer. Consequently, the summary dismissal of the petition for post-conviction relief was reversed, and the case was remanded for a hearing on the merits of the petition, and if necessary, for the determination of appropriate relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary dismissal of the petition for post-conviction relief was reversed, because petitioner had presented a colorable claim that his counsel's ineffective assistance caused him to reject the plea agreement and proceed to trial.

Appellant asserted that &sect; 11-7-6(A) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted in municipal court of using the warehouse of his moving business as his personal residence in violation of Mesa City Code &sect; 11-7-6(A). The trial court affirmed the conviction, finding that &sect; 11-7-6(A) was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Appellant challenged that decision. On appeal, the court affirmed. Although the evidence was sufficient to conclude that appellant had violated &sect; 11-7-6(A), which prohibited the residential use of property zoned for an industrial purpose, the trial court made no findings of fact, and thus the court was forced to address the facial validity of &sect; 11-7-6(A). The court held that the language of &sect; 11-7-6(A) clearly conveyed to the reader that the prohibition was that one could not set up a residence on industrially zoned property, and that a person of ordinary intelligence could distinguish at what point he had set up a residence from merely performing incidental activities that could also be performed in the home. Also, police officers testified that &sect; 11-7-6(A) was necessary to ensure public safety. Thus, the court held that &sect; 11-7-6(A) was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was affirmed; appellant violated the city zoning regulation prohibiting residential use of property zoned for an industrial purpose.

Appellant State charged him with custodial interference under Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-1302 (Supp. 1999). The lower court held that this statute required an ongoing court proceeding concerning custody before a person could be charged with custodial interference. However, a common-sense reading of the language of &sect; 13-1302(A)(2) compelled the court to hold that pending custody proceedings were not a prerequisite to a prosecution for custodial interference. By its own terms, the statute covered any act of custodial interference that took place before the entry of a court order regardless of whether there was a pending court action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the ruling of the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona), which upheld the decision of the Arizona Corporation Commission to grant certificates of convenience and necessity to appellees pursuant to Ariz. Admin. Code R14-2-1101 through R14-2-1115, and rejected appellant's argument that this violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, 11 telecommunications companies, applied to appellee state corporation commission for competitive certificates of convenience and necessity (CC&amp;Ns) in order to enter the Arizona local exchange and &quot;intraLATA&quot; markets. Appellant telephone company intervened in each application. The appellee commission granted competitive CC&amp;Ns to each of the telecommunications appellees without inquiring into the fair value of their investments in property held within the state and determining a reasonable rate of return on those investments, or imposing a carrier-of-last-resort obligation on them, as it did on appellant. The district court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, because appellant had yet to apply for a competitive CC&amp;N of its own, so its claim based on disparate treatment was not ripe for review. The court reversed in part and remanded, holding that appellee commission was required to ascertain the fair value of property owned by all public service corporations when setting their rates, under Ariz. Const. art. 15, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court judgment was affirmed in part, because appellant's equal protection claim was not yet ripe for review. The judgment was reversed in part and remanded, because appellee commission was required by the state constitution to determine fair value rate bases for all public service corporations in the state before setting their rates.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff agency appealed a summary judgment which was granted to defendant based on a finding that defendant did not have a substantial nexus with the state under the Commerce Clause. The appellate court reversed and remanded with directions to grant judgment to plaintiff agency. The substantial nexus was established by defendant's salespersons' and trainers' trips to the state which were intendced to, and did, result in additional sales of defendant's products.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Maricopa County Superior Court (Arizona), affirming his Phoenix Municipal Court conviction for violating the City of Phoenix's neighborhood preservation ordinance due to the condition of defendant's premises. Defendant appealed pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-375 (1990), alleging the unconstitutionality of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued a Phoenix ordinance violated substantive due process. He invoked the fundamental right to privacy, identifying &quot;the sanctity and privacy of the home&quot; as the interest at stake. The court viewed defendant's request as seeking protection of a right to keep an accumulation of debris in his yard. A right that not only was not fundamental but did not exist. The court held safeguarding the general health, safety, and welfare of the community and protecting aesthetic values by avoiding visual clutter were proper goals for municipal government. The court found the ordinance adequately restricted its scope so as to target only conditions that the city could have legitimately regulated. Consequently, the ordinance's means of achieving its objectives were reasonable. The ordinance passed rational basis scrutiny and was facially constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because safeguarding the general health, safety, and welfare of the community and protecting aesthetic values by avoiding visual clutter were proper goals for municipal government.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minor appealed adjudication of the Cochise County Superior Court (Arizona), which found appellant delinquent for knowingly abusing a teacher or other school employee engaged in the performance of duties, in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-507.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole question presented on appeal was whether, by repeatedly telling a teacher's aide to &quot;f--- off,&quot; appellant knowingly abused a school employee, in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-507. The court vacated the delinquency adjudication, disagreeing with the State's contention that the terms &quot;insult&quot; and &quot;abuse&quot; were essentially synonymous or that &quot;to insult&quot; was necessarily also &quot;to abuse.&quot; The court concluded that the 1989 amendment to &sect; 15-507, which expressly deleted &quot;insults&quot; from the statute reflected legislative intent that insulting words alone would no longer qualify as criminal abuse under the statute. Appellant did not call the aide names, did not make an obscene gesture, and did not intimidate her. Although appellant's behavior was insolent and offensive, his words did not attack, injure, disparage, revile, or denounce the aide personally. Therefore, trial court erred as a matter of law in finding appellant responsible for violating &sect; 15-507.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Adjudication vacated; trial court erred in finding that appellant knowingly abused a school employee where appellant, although he used vulgarity, had a rude attitude, and talked back to the employee, did not attack, injure, disparage, revile, or denounce the employee personally.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that by invoking the statute to appoint the doctor, the trial court impermissibly gave statutory protections to appellees that the legislature intended only to extend to parents. The court disagreed. It found no reason why the legislature would allow the trial courts discretion to order supervision for parent visitation, but deny such relief for grandparent visitation. The court also found that the order was neither vague nor ambiguous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Arizona allowed a deduction from income for dividends received from corporations doing more than half of their business in Arizona.

The trial court certified the class and petitioner Arizona Department of Revenue appealed, seeking to avoid the high cost of giving notice to potential class members and seeking appellate court jurisdiction because legal issues of statewide importance were involved. The court affirmed that taxpayers could bring a class action because Ariz. R. Civ. P. 23 applied to tax actions. However, class certification did not negate the requirement of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 42-124, 42-129(E), and 42-1118(E), that each taxpayer must individually exhaust their administrative remedies by filing an individual refund claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with two counts of reckless second degree murder. The jury in the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) however, found him guilty of two lesser-included counts of reckless manslaughter. Defendant appealed, raising two issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant accidentally shot his girlfriend, when she was eight and one-half months pregnant. Although she died shortly after arriving at the hospital, her daughter was delivered alive. But the fatal injury to the mother had so decreased the blood supply to the baby that the infant died the following day. Defendant's appeal raised an issue of first impression: whether a newborn child who died from injuries inflicted while the child was in utero was a &quot;person&quot; within the meaning of Arizona's homicide statutes. Defendant contended that because the injury was inflicted on a fetus, the victim was not a &quot;person&quot; within the meaning of the homicide statutes. The judgment was affirmed. Because the infant was undeniably a &quot;person&quot; at the time of her death a day after the shooting, it was irrelevant that the injuries that led to her death were inflicted while she was still in utero.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that Arizona's homicide statutes applied to the killing of a child born alive, even if the death resulted from injuries inflicted before birth and also that the trial court did not err in defining reasonable doubt as mandated by its supreme court, the convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed conviction for drug charges in Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) alleging that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-206&nbsp;unconstitutionally required clear and convincing proof of entrapment and unconstitutionally eliminated requirement for jury instructions concerning presumption of innocence and government's burden of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of drug charges and alleged that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-206, governing the defense of entrapment, was unconstitutional since it required defendant to prove the defense by clear and convincing evidence and improperly limited jury instructions. The court held that the affirmative defense of entrapment was not of constitutional dimension and requiring proof of the defense by clear and convincing evidence was not unconstitutionally onerous since it did not lessen the government's burden to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the presumption of innocence and the government's burden of proof were fundamental constitutional guarantees which were violated by requiring the court to instruct the jury only on the defense of entrapment, even where the defendant admitted every element of the offenses as required by the statute. The unconstitutional subsection of the statute was severable from the remainder of the statute, however, and did not require a finding of invalidity with regard to the entire statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction was reversed; requiring proof of entrapment defense by clear and convincing evidence was not unconstitutional but, even though defense required defendant to admit every element of offenses, defendant was nonetheless entitled to jury instructions concerning presumption of defendant's innocence and government's burden to prove offenses beyond reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence that the victim had allegedly falsely accused a boy of attempting to sexually assault her on a prior occasion, or in denying a motion for mistrial after a police officer testified that he had terminated his interview with the defendant after the defendant requested a lawyer. The court did not commit reversible error by denying the defendant's requested jury instruction on self-defense with respect to an aggravated assault charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an award of the tax court of fees to attorneys who successfully represented appellee taxpayers and those similarly situated on a refund claim. The factual background of the case concerned the pre-1991 exemption in Arizona from state income tax of the amount of money state and local government employees paid into retirement plans. In 1989, the United States Supreme Court invalidated a similar tax provision because no exemption was afforded federal employees. In that year, five taxpayers, who were federal employees and who were appellees in the case, sued defendant, seeking a declaration that the Arizona tax scheme violated 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111. After years of legal proceedings, the Arizona governor ordered refunds. Appellees asked that their attorneys be awarded 20 per cent of the refunds. The tax court ruled that the common fund doctrine applied and that appellees' attorneys were entitled to an award of reasonable fees. The court was persuaded that the recovery at issue properly constituted a common fund for purposes of shifting attorney's fees under the common-fund doctrine, and it affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because the tax court did not err in awarding fees under the common fund doctrine, and the fee award was reasonable. Additionally, defendant did not have standing to assert the due process rights of the non-party taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his two convictions from the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, for aggravated driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, alleging his blood sample was illegally obtained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of aggravated driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Defendant appealed these convictions alleging his blood sample, demonstrating an over the legal limit of alcohol content, was illegally obtained by force. The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that a warrant for the blood sample had been properly obtained. The court held that reasonable force was permissible to overcome resistance to execution of a search warrant for the removal of blood.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions, as reasonable force to obtain a blood sample was proper because there was a valid search warrant authorizing the procedure.</SPAN></P>
