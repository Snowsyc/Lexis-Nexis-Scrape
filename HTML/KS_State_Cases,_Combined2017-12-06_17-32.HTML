</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Wyandotte District Court (Kansas) that convicted him of statutory rape in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3502(a)(2) and aggravated indecent liberties with a child in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3504(a)(1), arguing that the district court erred in permitting a witness to testify on the truthfulness of the victim's testimony and that the statutes under which he was convicted were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the victim, defendant's teenage daughter became pregnant, she admitted that her father had impregnated her. The victim had an abortion, and testing of the fetal issue revealed that defendant was the father and that the fetus was the product of an incestuous relationship. At trial, the victim recanted her statement and denied having sexual intercourse with her father. Despite her recantation, defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court held that the district court did not err in permitting the forensic interviewer who interviewed the victim to opine about why a child might recant an allegation of sexual abuse because the witness only gave her expert opinion as to why a hypothetical child might recant and did not render an opinion about the victim's credibility. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statutory rape and aggravated indecent liberties statutes were unconstitutional because they prohibited all unmarried adolescents from engaging in consensual intimate activity without regard to maturity level. The legislature had a legitimate goal of protecting children from adult sexual predators, and both statutes were rationally related to achieving that goal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of an order from the Pawnee District Court (Kansas), which upheld an order from appellee, the State of Kansas, Department of Agriculture, Division of Water Resources (DWR), terminating the property owner's water rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner's water right was declared abandoned and terminated on the ground that no beneficial use of water had been reported for the years 1985 through 2003. The trial court upheld the order. On appeal, the court found that the water use reports from 1985 to 2003 did not show any water usage and failed to state due and sufficient cause for the nonusage, as required by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 82a-732(a) (Supp. 2007). The form provided by the DWR chief engineer put the property owner on notice that it was required to provide the amount of water usage to the DWR each year, and if no water was used, it had to provide a reason for the nonusage. The DWR followed the procedures outlined in the statutes in terminating the water right, and the property owner's due process rights were not violated. Kan. Admin. Regs. 5-7-1(d) required the property owner to show due and sufficient cause for any nonuse established by the verified report. The property owner had the burden of proof to show lawful and beneficial use of the water, or due and sufficient cause for nonuse, which it failed to do. There was substantial evidence to support the termination of the property owner's water right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant challenged a judgment of the Shawnee District Court (Kansas) affirming the denial of disability benefits by appellee Kansas Public Employees Retirement System (KPERS).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant suffered from back problems during his employment as a school teacher and coach in a public school district. His teaching contract was not renewed due to a decline in student enrollment and budget constraints. KPERS denied the claimant's request disability income benefits, which he filed after his termination, because he did not have a total disability at the time that he left his employment and because he failed to provide timely written notice of his claim. The Kansas Administrative Procedure Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-519(a), authorized KPERS to consider and rule on a motion for summary judgment. The court looked to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-621(c)(4), (c)(5), when considering the propriety of the summary judgment. The claim was untimely because the disability plan unambiguously required the claimant to give written notice within 180 days of disability. However, to establish that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, KPERS had to show that it was not prejudiced by the claimant's late disability claim. The hearing officer was obliged to resolve all facts and inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in favor of the claimant as the nonmoving party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court, set aside the order for summary judgment in favor of KPERS, and remanded the case for further administrative proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner church appealed from an order of the Kansas State Board of Tax Appeals that denied its application for exemption from ad valorem taxes for its pickup truck, arguing that the Board of Tax Appeals erroneously determined that it was not entitled to a personal property exemption under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201 because the church used the truck to further its religious activities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Church members picketed at various sites including churches, military funerals, government offices, and political conventions using signs expressing the church's message in acrimonious language and asserting that God was punishing the United States because of its acceptance of homosexuality. The church used a pickup truck to transport its signs to various locations and claimed an exemption from taxation for the truck under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201. The Board of Tax Appeals held that, because signs labeling public figures and institutions as &quot;fag,&quot; &quot;dyke,&quot; &quot;whore,&quot; &quot;pervert,&quot; or &quot;Nazi&quot; conveyed no religious message and served no religious purpose, the truck used to transport such signs was not used for a strictly religious purpose and was not exempt. On review, the court held that the Board of Tax Appeals violated the Establishment Clause in indulging in an analysis of the protest signs and labeling them nonreligious. Nevertheless, the property was not exempt because there was an obvious political component to the church's activities where they picketed at political events. Because the truck was used for political activities and not merely religious ones, it was not exempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Douglas District Court, Kansas, convicted defendant of aggravated burglary. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, the sentencing instructions, and his sentence. The appellate court held that aggravated burglary did not require proof that defendant knew the victim was present in the building at the time it was burgled. The evidence showed that the victim arrived during the ongoing commission of the crime and that defendant had assembled in the kitchen the items being stolen and had opened the door from the house to the garage in order to transport them to his truck so he could carry them off and thereby permanently deprive the victim of them. Defendant's intent to commit a theft could be inferred from the surrounding circumstances. The district did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on simple burglary as a lesser-included offense because there was no evidence that he was alone in the home throughout the crime. As defendant pled guilty to the two prior burglaries, there was no need for a jury to make this determination for Apprendi purposes. The assessment of attorney fees against defendant was improper as the necessary financial inquiry required by the recoupment statute was not made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed, but the assessment of attorney fees was vacated and remanded for consideration of defendant's financial circumstances in order to determine the appropriateness of assessing attorney fees against him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a probation condition imposed by the Dickinson District Court (Kansas) requiring defendant to submit to nonconsensual, suspicionless searches performed by community corrections or law enforcement officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentencing judge's comments and ultimate order during sentencing provided that either community corrections or law enforcement officers could conduct searches at any time for potentially any reason. The sole issue on appeal was whether the condition of probation relating to searches was constitutional. Generally, conditions of probation were not per se presumptive, and such conditions were a matter within the discretion of the sentencing court. The appellate court noted that probationers did not enjoy the same level of freedom and Fourth Amendment protections as ordinary citizens. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4610 set forth a nonexclusive list of acceptable conditions of probation; however, there was no search condition contained on the list. The appellate court concluded that the condition imposed in this case was unconstitutional because probationer searches in Kansas were generally required to be supported by reasonable suspicion. This ruling was in keeping with case law that recognized that Kansas had not gone as far as California in authorizing probationer/parolee searches.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the district court's decision, and the matter was remanded with directions to the district court to vacate the challenged condition of probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners operated housing units for homeless people and people of low income. The owners argued that BOTA erroneously interpreted and applied the law pertaining to their applications when it determined that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201 Ninth and Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1(b) did not apply to allow an exemption for the subject properties. The court determined that because the subject properties in this case were primarily low income housing facilities, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201b Fourth was the applicable exemption statute. Nevertheless, based on the plain meaning of &sect; 79-201b Fourth and the strict construction that had to be given to exemption statutes, the owners were not entitled to a statutory tax exemption due to their failure to meet the requirements of &sect; 79-201b Fourth. Moreover, the owners did not fit within the charitable purposes exemption under art. 11, &sect; 1(b)(2) because they failed to show that the services they provided were free of charge or so nearly free of charge as to make the charges nominal or negligible.</SPAN></P>

The checkpoint was organized, managed, and controlled by the Jackson County Sheriff's Department. An oral agreement for assistance between the requesting sheriff and city police qualified as a &quot;request for assistance&quot; under &sect; 22-2401a(2)(b).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the employer for 23 years. She had a history of lower back problems. In 2002, she re-injured her back on the job and again in an automobile accident a few days later while returning from medical treatment for her back. It was undisputed that the 2002 injuries were compensable. An administrative law judge (ALJ) found that she was permanently and totally disabled, but that her disability award should be reduced under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-501(c) because of her 35 percent preexisting functional impairment. The Board upheld the ALJ's decision. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 44-501 applied to the employee as written. The sole medical testimony established and measured the extent of the preexisting functional impairment. The employee herself testified that she was able to return to work because of the employer's accommodations to her many work restrictions. The employee's reduced benefits were due to the fact that only a portion of her disability was attributable to her job-related injury. The second sentence of &sect; 44-501(c), as applied to the employee, met the rational basis test and did not violate her right to due process under Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kansas Board of Tax Appeals (BOTA) granted judgment in favor of appellee county appraiser by denying appellant taxpayers' claim for an exemption from ad valorem tax on equipment utilized in their tree harvesting and sawmill operation pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201j(a) (Supp. 2007). The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers argued that BOTA misconstrued and applied the operative statute and that its order was otherwise arbitrary and capricious. The appellate court agreed with BOTA that the taxpayers' harvesting operation was farming. Its task was to determine where the farming operation ended and a processing or manufacturing operation began. The taxpayers' sawmill operation did not constitute farming and the associated machinery and equipment was not exempt under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201j(a) (Supp. 2007). A sawmill was simply not a farming operation. A sawmill was a processing or manufacturing establishment. There was nothing arbitrary or capricious about BOTA's reliance on the fact that the line between farming and processing or manufacturing was crossed by the lumbering activities at the sawmill in arriving at its decision not to exempt the machinery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The appellate court noted that the buyers had to show that the car was not fit for the purpose for which cars were used; that the air conditioner did not work when it left the dealership's control; and that the air conditioner caused injury. There was no evidence in the record on appeal that the air conditioner was tested at the time the car was sold. An air conditioner was not a major component of a car that was 10 years old with over 135,000 miles on it, and did not fall within the implied warranty of merchantability. The district court ruled in the buyers' favor, affirming the small claims court decision by reaching the same conclusion and awarding the same amount of damages. Because the district court was incorrect, the buyers were not entitled to attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and father claimed that the termination of their rights to their child was improper. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that the Kansas Revised Code for Care of Children did not violate equal protection through the use of a lower evidentiary standard under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-2269(a) (Supp. 2006) than that found in the Indian Child Welfare Act. There was substantial evidence supporting the trial court's finding of unfitness, given the testimony that the mother and father failed to address, including sexual abuse allegations, plus neither the mother nor the father made substantial progress on the case plan regarding their living conditions, they delayed in getting parenting evaluations, and they had 26 months to make the proper changes and did not. The child in this case made no request to be heard personally and the trial court had ample information about her emotional well-being from other witnesses. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining to bring the child in for a personal interview under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-2262 (Supp. 2006).</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3504(a)(3)(A) and one count of sexual exploitation of a child in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3516(a)(2) (1998 Supp).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's aggravated indecent liberties charges were based on his lewd fondling or touching of two child victims; the sexual exploitation of a child charge was based on defendant's possession of pictures on a computer depicting a child under 18 years of age engaging in sexually explicit conduct. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to sever his charge of sexual exploitation of a child from the aggravated indecent liberties with a child counts because none of the conditions precedent of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3202(1) were met, as the crimes were not the same or of similar character, the State did not show that the crimes were based on a common scheme or plan, and they did not arise out of the same act or transaction. Misjoinder of the charges did not constitute harmless error because the highly inflammatory evidence used to prove the charge of sexual exploitation of a child was sufficiently prejudicial to deny defendant a fair trial. The evidence the State used to prove the charge of sexual exploitation of a child could have led the jury to conclude that because defendant possessed pictures, he was disposed to commit other lewd crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sedgwick District Court, Kansas, convicted defendant of an aggravated weapons violation under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4202 and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4201(a)(2) (Supp. 2006) for carrying a &quot;dangerous knife&quot; concealed on his person. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the knife in question was a &quot;pocket knife&quot; under the statute and not a prohibited item. He next urged that the term &quot;dangerous knife&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. Finally, he contended the district court erred in determining the knife was dangerous. The appellate court disagreed with defendant on all of his points, finding first that the knife in question had a 3.5-inch straight serrated blade, similar to a steak knife; the blade was concealed in a comb that was about 7 inches long. The district court did not err in concluding this knife was not an ordinary pocket knife under the statute that would be legal to carry concealed on one's person. The appellate court also found that a person of common intelligence would have understood that this knife would qualify as a dangerous knife under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4201(a)(2) (Supp. 2006), and that the term &quot;dangerous knife&quot; as used in the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The knife defendant was carrying readily conveyed the notion that it could easily cause great bodily harm or death. It, therefore, was dangerous, and the statute prohibited one from carrying it concealed on his or her person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant received from a friend another man's driver's license number, social security number, birth date, address, bank statements, a credit report printout, and other documents on the same day. Since defendant used only one person's identity, he argued that two of his convictions had to be overturned because he was being punished three times for the same crime. The appellate court concluded that defendant's convictions were proper. Defendant used the victim's stolen identity at three different stores over a two-day period. Defendant's acts were separated by time, distance, and business establishments. A credit account was opened at two stores, and an application for credit was filled out for the third. Each new retail store gave a fresh impulse to defendant to use the victim's identity. There was no need for a jury instruction about common scheme. The jury's findings of aggravating sentencing factors were substantial and compelling. The trial court's use of aggravating sentencing factors not listed in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4716(c)(2) (Supp. 2004) did not deprive defendant of due process. Defendant's criminal history was not a jury question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washington District Court, Kansas, concluded that appellant adoptive mother had committed physical abuse against one of her children and that the child's siblings were likewise children in need of care under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-1502(a)(11) (Supp. 2005), which authorized protection for children residing with another child who was physically abused. The mother and appellant adoptive father challenged the adjudication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adoptive mother said that the child had taken too long in the bathtub and was generally being defiant. All three of the children had special needs, and they had been adopted after the children had been removed from their biological parents. On appeal, the adoptive parents claimed that there was insufficient evidence to find abuse and that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. A review of the records, however, revealed substantial evidence in support of the district court's conclusion that the child sustained bruising all around his left ear from the adoptive mother striking him with a 1-inch-thick wooden paddle. As to the constitutionality of the statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-1502(a)(3) (2005) provided sufficient guidance to satisfy constitutional standards. The statute used words commonly understood to forbid the conduct found in this case. In addition, the statute provided sufficient protection against arbitrary enforcement. The statute was not so vague that a citizen would be unaware that a person could not strike a child on the head with such a paddle. The statutory standard for physical abuse was sufficiently clear.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with possession of amphetamine and drug paraphernalia. The Lyon District Court (Kansas) granted defendants' motions to suppress evidence that a police officer had found in one defendant's car. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to a 2006 amendment, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2501(c) authorized a police officer to make a search incident to arrest for the purpose of discovering the fruits, instrumentalities, or evidence of &quot;the crime.&quot; In 2006, the latter phrase was amended to read &quot;a crime.&quot; In the case at hand, the arrest in question was for a traffic violation, but the officer's search of the car was for evidence of any crime. The trial court had expressed the view that under the 2006 amendment, the legislature intended to broaden the scope of a search to encompass a search for a crime other than that which brought the arrestee into custody but did not intend to encompass a search for any crime. However, the appellate court held that an application of the plain meaning of the word &quot;a&quot; in the amended version of &sect; 22-2501(c), along with the other words in that statute, resulted in an officer being authorized to search the person arrested and the area within such person's immediate presence for the purpose of discovering the fruits, instrumentalities, or evidence of any unspecified crime. Such a reading was constitutional and was consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in New York v. Belton.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's rulings on the motions to suppress were reversed. Both cases were remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient and defendant physician filed an interlocutory appeal to challenge a decision from the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas), which granted a motion for a new trial in a medical malpractice case after a jury found that the physician was 54 % at fault and awarded the patient damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to complications suffered by the patient based on a failure to perform a urinalysis prior to surgery, a medical malpractice case was filed. As a result of a postverdict telephone poll of the jurors, defense counsel sought a new trial after a verdict in favor of the patient. The trial court recalled the jury, and the motion was ultimately granted based on juror misconduct. This interlocutory appeal followed. In reversing, the appellate court held that review of the order granting a new trial was within the permissible scope of the interlocutory appeal because the three certified questions were the lynchpins for this order. Next, the expert testimony was properly allowed because Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-3412 did not require that the witness devote any specific or percentage of his time to the professional practice of the healing arts at issue. However, the district court erred in sua sponte ordering a jury recall under Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 181. The recall was not warranted based on a sole affidavit. The questioning of the jurors by the district court improperly invaded their mental processes. Finally, the collective testimony of the jurors did not support a finding of a quotient verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was reversed, and the case was remanded with directions to reinstate the verdict of the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, there was insufficient evidence to prove criminal sodomy. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the victim testified that the normal routine at her home was that from 3:30 p.m. until 5:00 p.m. there would be fondling and oral sex; defendant put his mouth on her vaginal area virtually every day that contact occurred. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3501(2) only required that there was oral contact with the female genitalia in order to satisfy the definition of sodomy; vaginal penetration was not required. As such, there was sufficient evidence for a conviction of sodomy. Further, the information which was in place at the time of the trial contained all of the elements of the crime, and the jury heard sufficient evidence to support convictions for indecent liberties with a child. Contrary to defendant's assertion, his convictions were not multiplicitous as the abuse occurred at hundreds of times at different times and in different places over the course of several years. Given the victim's testimony regarding the repeated and ongoing nature of the abuse, there were many acts which could have served as the basis of defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a no contest plea to a third felony charge of driving under the influence (DUI), and two other charges were dropped. The Jefferson District Court, Kansas, sentenced defendant to one year in county jail for the DUI, plus 30 days because of the presence of a minor. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that the additional 30-day sentence enhancement imposed violated his constitutional rights under Apprendi, that the trial court erred in ordering him to reimburse Board of Indigents' Defense Services (BIDS) for his attorney fees, and that the trial court erred in assessing the BIDS application fee in the journal entry of sentencing. The appellate court found that the fact that a child under the age of 14 was in defendant's truck was used to enhance the sentence beyond the statutory maximum but was not proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. While defendant pled no contest, he did not plead guilty; he neither stipulated to the presence of a child under the age of 14 in his vehicle, nor did he consent to the trial court finding such a fact. As such, the 30-day sentence enhancement was improper. Further, the trial court erred in ordering defendant to pay court-appointed attorney fees as it did not explicitly consider any of the factors listed in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4513 (Supp. 2006). And the record on appeal did not indicate defendant was ever ordered or otherwise directed to pay the BIDS application fee to the clerk of the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2003, appellant was committed to the SPTP at a hospital.

He was informed that he would have to retake several &quot;Core Phase&quot; classes. In May 2006, appellant sought habeas corpus relief. He alleged that his property, privileges, and job were taken and that more restrictive living conditions were imposed on him without due process of law. The trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss the action. On appeal, the court determined that because appellant's complaint involved an agency action and was controlled by the Kansas Act for Judicial Review and Civil Enforcement of Agency Actions (KJRA), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-603(a) (Supp. 2006), he brought his action in the wrong forum. The trial court correctly held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was ordered to complete the county community corrections residential center program as a condition of his probation. Defendant was allowed to leave the center, and defendant was declared absent without leave when he failed to return to the center. The parties did not dispute that defendant was ordered to attend the center as a condition of probation for his conviction of attempted robbery. Defendant argued that because he had been placed on house arrest, he was no longer in lawful custody. Defendant asserted that once he was released and placed on house arrest, he was not expected to return to the center to stay. The appellate court ruled that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to set aside defendant's plea to aggravated escape from custody. Although defendant was no longer residing at the center, he was in the custody of the center until he was released from the program. The program officials had not evidenced an intent to abandon or give up defendant, nor was defendant free to go on his way. Also, the journal entry of sentencing imposed Board of Indigents' Defense Services fees, but did not specify the amount of the fees.</SPAN></P>

The lab report concluded that three of the four baggies contained methamphetamine. Defendant claimed the trial court's reliance upon Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3437 to admit the incriminating results of lab tests performed on substances found in his possession denied him the right under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to confront his accuser He argued that his right of confrontation was violated because he was not able to cross-examine the technician who prepared the lab report. The instant court concluded that, because of the testimonial nature of the lab report and the trial court's discretion under &sect; 22-3437(3) to admit it into evidence over defendant's objection and without the testimony of the technician who prepared it, that portion of the statute violated the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause when applied to a defendant in a criminal case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a trial for voluntary manslaughter and criminal possession of a firearm, the Sedgwick County District Court (Kansas) denied defendant's motion to discharge the jury panel based upon alleged discrimination in the county's jury selection procedure. Defendant appealed his convictions and the denial of his motion for a downward departure from his presumptive sentence imposed under the Kansas Sentencing Guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the county employed a random, race-neutral procedure for obtaining a pool of prospective jurors, defendant contended that the county did not enforce jury service, which resulted in a disparity in the representation of African-Americans on juries. However, the appellate court observed that the fact that a certain segment of the community honored the county's jury summons slightly better than another segment did not establish a program of systematic discrimination, even if the segment of the community which failed to honor the summons was predominantly from one minority group. Although the district court had failed to impose sanctions, as required by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43-165, on jurors who did not appear for service, this failure applied equally to the entire community, and there was no evidence that lower income individuals were more likely to fail to appear for jury duty without excuse than higher income individuals. Also, there was no showing of racial discrimination in the State's exercise of its peremptory challenge against one of the three African-American jurors, as there was evidence that the juror had been rejected because of her unemployment and youth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's judgment was affirmed in part, with respect to the jury selection issue, and the appeal was dismissed in part for lack of jurisdiction as to the sentencing issue.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed, stating that it was unclear whether the trial court used the Troxel presumption, and if it did, whether it gave deference to the parents' opinion on grandparent visitation. As a result, the appellate court reversed and remanded to the trial court to apply the Troxel presumption that fit parents acted in the best interests of their children and that their opinion on grandparent visitation should be given special weight. Moreover, the trial court was ordered to explain whether it would have imposed the same grandparent visitation had it applied the Troxel presumption. If it would have not made the same visitation order, the trial court was to establish a new visitation. Because it was unclear whether the trial court applied the Troxel presumption, it was impossible for the appellate court to determine whether the trial court unconstitutionally applied Kan. Stat.

Also, the trial court did not err in admitting the results of defendant's second breath test. Although the arresting officer asked defendant to submit to a second breath test before giving the implied consent advisories, that earlier request did not taint the officer's later request after the implied consent advisories were given; the undisputed evidence established that the officer complied with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1001(h) by requesting defendant to submit to testing after he gave the implied consent advisories. Further, the results from the second breath test were not fruit of the poisonous tree of the first test. The officer performed the second breath test only because he realized that he had not given the implied consent advisories before administering the first test.

The Wyandotte District Court, Kansas, agreed and set aside the lien against the County's fee simple interest in the property. The contractor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the contractor contended the trial court erred in finding the lien fraudulent under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58-4301, arguing that the trial court exceeded its scope of authority under the statute by making findings of fact based only upon affidavits and documents submitted by the parties. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that the contractor never requested the trial court to hear testimony or to consider any evidence other than the documents the contractor attached to its response to the County's motion. The contractor was permitted to file a response to the motion, and the trial court did not restrict the documentation the contractor presented for review. Further, Kan. Stat. &sect; 58-4301(c) expressly allowed the trial court to make findings of fact. Finally, the lien made no mention of any contract or agreement between the contractor and the County. While the proposed purchase contract which never closed between the lessee and the County required the lessee to make capital improvements on the property, none of the work performed by the contractor was for these improvements.</SPAN></P>

The trial court chose to impose the presumptive high sentence of 247 months for aggravated robbery. Defendant's sentence for attempted second-degree murder remained 61 months; however, the sentences were to run consecutively. The use of juvenile adjudications in determining a criminal history score was appropriate notwithstanding the fact that such adjudications were not routinely the result of jury trials. The appellate court noted that there was no indication the Blakely decision altered the supreme court's holding in Hitt. As to whether the sentence was presumptively vindictive, the trial court originally imposed concurrent sentences with a controlling term of 494 months due to the court's decision to double the sentence for aggravated robbery. The combined sentences imposed after remand for resentencing were less than the original sentences, the fact that the two sentences were run consecutively the second time as opposed to concurrently the first time did not show vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was charged with two counts of aggravated robbery, and the district court designated the proceeding as an extended juvenile jurisdiction prosecution. The district court found that the juvenile, who pled guilty, was a violent offender as defined by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-16,129(a)(1)(B). The district court imposed both a juvenile sentence and an adult criminal sentence, which was stayed, and ordered that the juvenile could not receive more than 15 percent good time credit. The JJA argued that the district court erred by limiting the amount of good time credit that the Commissioner could award. As an initial matter, the court found that JJA and the Commissioner had standing to challenge the order concerning good time credit. On the merits, the court agreed with JJA that the district court lacked statutory authority to limit the juvenile's good time credit. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-16,130 gave the Commissioner the authority to implement a good time credit program for juveniles. The court rejected appellee State's contention that the Commissioner's power under &sect; 38-16,130 to award good time credit violated the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was injured while he was participating in an educational activity while a resident at a juvenile justice facility. He filed a negligence action against the State, the authority, and the service center. All of the claims were dismissed, and the juvenile sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-105b(d) was a prerequisite to commencement of suit, and the failure to give notice deprived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction over the claim against the service center. Further, the savings statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-518, did not permit the juvenile to refile after the limitation period had run. Next, the district court properly granted summary judgment to the State based upon the State's specific grant of immunity under the juvenile justice program exception to the Kansas Tort Claims Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-6104(u) (Supp. 2005). The statute survived an equal protection challenge since the promotion of the education of juvenile offenders had a rational basis. Finally, the delegation of duty argument was meritless.</SPAN></P>

Defendant took field sobriety tests and showed signs of impairment. The court affirmed and held that because defendant was prosecuted for DUI, failure to provide proof of automobile liability insurance, and refusal to submit to a preliminary breath test, evidence of the preliminary breath test refusal was admissible to prove refusal to submit to a preliminary breath test under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1012 (Supp. 2005). The trial court should have instructed the jury to consider evidence of defendant's preliminary breath test refusal only for the charge of refusal to submit to a preliminary breath test under &sect; 8-1012. However, defendant failed to object to the lack of a limiting instruction, and even if the trial court had given a limiting instruction, there was no real possibility that the jury would have acquitted defendant because the evidence was overwhelming that defendant was guilty of DUI. Also, as there was no impermissible form of coercion when a suspect refuses a breath test, no Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination was implicated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Crawford District Court (Kansas) convicting him of driving or attempting to drive under the influence of alcohol in violation of Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion for a new trial based on the admission of defendant's deficient breath test results into evidence; because a deficient sample breath test was included within the meaning of other competent evidence under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1013(f)(2) (2005 Supp.), and because other competent evidence was admissible under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 8-1005, 8-1006 in criminal proceedings for driving under the influence of alcohol, it was apparent that defendant's deficient sample breath test was admissible in his prosecution under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1567(a)(3). The trial court did not err by admitting the breath test results into evidence without granting defendant a continuance, even though the State provided defense counsel a copy of the results on the morning of trial, because defendant knew about the test before his trial, defense counsel conceded that the test had been an issue in the case before the State's disclosure, and defendant admitted that he was not prejudiced by the State's late disclosure of the documents. There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The order requiring defendant to reimburse the Board of Indigents' Defense Services for his attorney's fees was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court to tax a specific amount of attorney fees and to determine the amount and method of payment of such sum that defendant was able to pay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of burglary related to incidents where he stole women's lingerie from his neighbors. The Butler District Court, Kansas, sentenced defendant to 32 months' imprisonment, but than placed him on a 24-month probation and ordered restitution. In a continuation of the sentencing hearing, the trial judge found defendant's crimes were sexually motivated and ordered that he register as a sex offender. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that because Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4902(c)(14) (Supp. 2005) of the Kansas Offender Registration Act allowed the punishment for a conviction to be enhanced after factual findings by the court, rather than a jury, it was unconstitutional under the rule of Apprendi. Defendant also challenged the trial court's order of restitution. The appellate court held that Apprendi did not apply to the sentencing judge's finding that defendant's offense was sexually motivated, which was supported by the following evidence: defendant entered homes with the sole intent to steal women's lingerie in order to facilitate masturbation, had previously engaged in this behavior, and had been diagnosed with a fetish disorder. As to restitution, requiring defendant to pay for the cost of a security system installed by one of his neighbors was improper as it was a tangential cost incurred as a result of defendant's offenses. However, because the used lingerie had no readily ascertainable market value, the sentencing judge's consideration of replacement value evidence was not an abuse of discretion in the valuation of restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's ruling ordering defendant to register as a sex offender was affirmed; the order of restitution for the installation of a security system was reversed; and the restitution order in all other respects was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer discovered that it had been paying taxes on computer software erroneously. It filed an exemption application and sought a refund for the years 1996 and thereafter. At the time the application was filed, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;79-213(k) (Supp. 2002) allowed for three years of refunds. However, an amendment in 2003 limited this to one year, and the amendment had retroactive application. After the BOTA limited the refund to such, the taxpayer sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that the retroactive application of &sect; 79-213(k) violated the taxpayer's due process rights under the Kansas and United States Constitutions. There was no issue that at the time of the application, and before the statutory change, that the taxpayer was entitled to a refund for taxes paid on this tax-exempt property. Therefore, the right to a refund before the legislative change was not contingent or inchoate, but fully vested at the time of the application and before the change to &sect; 79-213(k).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the child under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act. The court disagreed, stating that although it appeared that Missouri had jurisdiction under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-1348(a)(2), the Missouri court declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that Kansas was the more appropriate forum. Therefore, a Kansas court could assume jurisdiction under &sect; 38-1348(a)(3). However, the court reversed the trial court's decision terminating the mother's parental rights. Based on the evidence presented by the State at the termination hearing, the court determined that the presumption of unfitness was a Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-414(b) presumption that was rebutted by the mother's evidence. Nevertheless, the court determined that the mother's abusive conduct towards the child's older sibling, coupled with the previous terminations of her parental rights in three children, furnished substantial competent evidence to support the determination that the child was a child in need of care. Finally, the court determined that there was not substantial evidence supporting the decision that the father was an unfit parent.</SPAN></P>

The Sedgwick District Court, Kansas, entered a determination that interest was statutorily required on deferred settlement payments that were to be paid by the Health Care Stabilization Fund. Appellant physician challenged the finding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court approved a settlement agreement reached among the parties. The physician made the argument, on appeal, that a settlement was a contract and that when a contract was silent on an issue, the logical conclusion was that the contract imposed no obligation with respect to that issue. The patients, on the other hand, pursued interest as a matter of law, pursuant to statute, rather than as a contractual obligation. The appellate court's sole focus was on statutory interpretation. The appellate court determined that &sect; 40-3403(d) was not intended to create an independent statutory right to receive interest from the Fund where the medical malpractice settlement agreement contained no contract provision for the payment of such interest. In this case, two installments for two years did not require interest at the judgment rate. The district court's ruling to the contrary was erroneous. Moreover, the statute was not in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Kansas Constitution. If a classification existed, it emanated from Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16-204 (Supp 2005) that mandated interest only on judgments; however, the constitutionality of that statute was not questioned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions in the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) of rape and aggravated indecent liberties with a child. The primary issue on appeal was whether Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3434 violated defendant's constitutional right to confrontation of witnesses under Crawford.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been babysitting, and when the child told her mother that defendant had hurt her, the child was examined and internal injuries were discovered that were typical of blunt force penetration. The child testified by closed-circuit television, and she was cross-examined. The court affirmed, and noted that the Kansas Supreme Court had upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 22-3434 despite the &quot;face to face&quot; language contained in &sect; 10 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights. Also, necessity for the closed-circuit testimony was shown as at the pre-trial hearing, there was testimony that the child might freeze if forced to testify in defendant's presence and would suffer permanent trauma resulting from the incident. Denial of defendant's motion for an independent psychological evaluation of the child was proper because the child had established a relationship with a therapist who testified; she was a neutral witness not secured by the State. However, defendant's conviction of aggravated indecent liberties with a child was reversed because the charges were multiplicitous. The court also held that photographs of the child's hymen were relevant to the element of penetration.</SPAN></P>

Notice of the tax foreclosure lawsuit was published in a newspaper. Default judgments were awarded to the county and the parcels were sold at a sheriff's sale. The property owners moved to set aside the default judgments pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-260(b)(4). The trial court denied their motions. On appeal, as to the first property owners, the court found that the trial court erred in finding that they did not meet their burden of showing that they were not properly served. The county did not conduct a proper search prior to resorting to service by publication. There was evidence indicating that the county could have discovered the correct address for service by performing a reasonable investigation. As to the second property owner, a corporation, the evidence was sufficient to prove that an employee from the corporation picked up the papers from the process server at the sheriff's office. The employee had performed similar duties on other occasions. Thus, the employee was a general agent of the corporation, and, therefore, service was proper pursuant to Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After taking cigarettes from a store, defendant was charged with theft. The district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial when it proceeded with a bench trial on his misdemeanor theft charge even though defendant did not waive a jury trial. The district court did not ignore defendant's request for a new attorney. Counsel stated he did not have a conflict in representing defendant at trial. In the drug case, defendant was not entitled to suppress his volunteered statements to police that he was planning on selling crack cocaine to make money. The evidence was sufficient to support his conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to sell after a prior conviction. Defendant was not entitled to an instruction that the jury had to find that he possessed the cocaine for a sufficient length of time to acquire a drug tax stamp under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-5208. The State sufficiently proved defendant's prior convictions at the sentencing phase by presenting his presentence investigation report.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest to one count of aggravated indecent liberties with a child, his four-year-old daughter. His presentence investigation report disclosed a 1987 juvenile adjudication for aggravated incest. Consequently, the trial court concluded that he qualified for sentencing as a persistent sex offender. He was sentenced to a controlling term of 110 months' imprisonment. On appeal, the court found no merit to defendant's claim that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4704(j) was unconstitutional under Apprendi and Gould. The court further found that aggravated incest was not listed as a per se sexually violent crime under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3717(d)(2). Defendant's juvenile adjudication for aggravated incest was not determined beyond a reasonable doubt to have been sexually motivated at the time of sentencing for the offense, as required by &sect; 22-3717(d)(2)(L). Accordingly, the trial court erred by finding that his prior juvenile adjudication for aggravated incest constituted a sexually violent crime for the purpose of sentencing him as a persistent sex offender. He was entitled to resentencing without the application of the enhancement in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4704(j).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the district court's failure to grant a mistrial was an abuse of discretion because the attorney misconduct was inconsistent with substantial justice, affected his substantial rights, and denied him his right to a fair trial. The court of appeals agreed. The State's entire closing argument was obviously planned with an impermissible theme running throughout. The use of an allegory was specifically designed to play upon a powerful motivator-the jurors' fears as parents and as guardians of the community's children. The allegory ultimately referenced the jurors' own children and was preceded by repeatedly provocative references, effectively encouraging the jury to forsake its sworn duty to reach a verdict through fair, impartial, and dispassionate deliberation. Defendant's first trial resulted in a mistrial due to a hung jury, and the critical issue of whether defendant's mental abnormality or personality disorder made it difficult if not impossible to control his dangerous behavior was disputed by his experts' testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant challenged a judgment of the Shawnee District Court (Kansas) that affirmed the administrative hearing officer's (AHO) decision that terminated claimant's disability benefits from respondent Kansas Public Employees Retirement System (KPERS) on the ground that the claimant was not totally disabled within the meaning of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-4902(32) and refused accommodated work without good cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the claimant was legally blind and could only read if objects very close to his eyes, he worked for his public employer until he suffered a work-related neck injury. The AHO and district court terminated the claimant's KPERS disability benefits. On review, the court found that the employer had offered the claimant accommodations to allow him to resume his job duties and that the claimant's refusal to accept the accommodations was equivalent to refusing employment for which he was suitably educated and trained; thus, his disability could not be deemed a &quot;total disability&quot; under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-4902(32). The court found that the claimant failed to demonstrate a legitimate basis for refusing the accommodations. However, the court held that summary dismissal was inappropriate because questions remained as to whether the claimant was denied due process of law by the KPERS's delay or failure to hold a timely post-termination hearing as required by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-4904(2) or if the claimant waived the issue of a timely hearing. The court held that the district court did not err by relying upon persuasive authority pertaining to workers compensation disability cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's finding that the claimant was not totally disabled but reversed the summary dismissal of the claimant's due process claim and remanded the case to the hearing officer for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether his due process right to a timely post-termination hearing was violated or he validly waived his right to have the hearing process initiated within 60 days of his written request.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents appealed the court-ordered reestablishment of grandparent visits between their daughter and son and the grandmother.

The court affirmed on appeal pursuant to Kan. Stat.

Thus, substantial evidence existed to support the district court's finding that the children's best interests would be served by allowing a relationship with their grandmother to continue. Additionally, the court stated that &sect; 38-129 made no distinction between nuclear families and other types of families; thus, the court rejected the parents' assertion that their decision to deny visitation, made as two fit parents in a continuing nuclear family, should have been given absolute deference by the district court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From the outset, the child was told that the stepfather was her father. The marriage between the stepfather and the mother was short lived. At that time, the mother told the child, for the first time, that the stepfather was not her father. The parents maintained that the district court erred in granting the stepfather visitation because he was no longer the child's stepfather. The ultimate issue was whether the district court erred in ordering stepparent visitation with the child. The appellate court noted that the stepfather was a stepparent within the contemplation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1616(b). The appellate court also satisfied itself that judicial tinkering with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1616 was not an impermissible invasion into the legislative domain. No reasonable basis had been established upon which an appellate court should distinguish the standards for examining a stepparent's claim for visitation from a grandparent's claim. The district court did not err in its analysis. Section 60-1616(b) was constitutional with regard to stepparent visitation when the requirements and limitations enumerated in case law and Kan. Stat.

Without a copy of the banking standards and regulations, the instant court was unable to conclude whether the accountant was justified in relying on those standards instead of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Professional Standards and the Board's administrative regulations. It was clear that the accountant submitted his director's examination report on his CPA letterhead, which included the title of &quot;Certified Bank Auditor.&quot; He signed it as a member of the bank's board of directors. Accordingly, he was acting in his capacity as a CPA when he submitted the report, and the Board was correct in finding that he should have followed the AICPA's professional standards and the Board's regulations. There was substantial competent evidence to support the Board's findings that he willfully violated Kan. Admin.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, appellants, two taxpayers, appealed a judgment of the Finney District Court, Kansas, which upheld a decision of the Kansas Board of Tax Appeals (BOTA) denying their tax grievance applications against appellee county appraiser under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-1701 for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In both cases, the appraiser misclassified the construction type of buildings owned by the taxpayers, but refused to treat the misclassifications as clerical errors within the meaning of &sect; 79-1701. The court held that the appraiser's classification errors were clerical errors. The mistakes constituted an error in the descriptions of the properties. The court found nothing in the statute limiting the term &quot;description&quot; to the legal description to the exclusion of the physical description. On the contrary, the classification of property determined the rate of assessment. The description of the property referred to the property's physical and legal description. In making mistakes in the composition of the building materials, the appraiser made errors in the descriptions of the properties. By misclassifying the types of building construction, the appraiser essentially classified the properties as containing structures with a higher market value than they really possessed. The errors caused improvements to be assessed upon real estate when no such improvements were in existence. The appraiser's errors could entitle the taxpayers to retroactive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded to BOTA for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order of the Shawnee District Court (Kansas) that denied its motion to correct defendant's sentence on the ground that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4720(b)(5) (Supp. 2004), as amended by 2000 Kan. Sess. Laws 37, only applied prospectively. The State argued that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4720(b)(5) required an appellate court to remand a case for resentencing when a defendant's primary conviction had been reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State claimed that once defendant's aggravated robbery conviction was reversed, the sentence for his attempted rape conviction no longer conformed to the sentencing guidelines and was therefore illegal. The State argued that when Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4720(b)(5) was amended, the legislature was clarifying existing law, not changing the law; thus, retroactive application of the amendment to defendant's case was appropriate. The court noted that Kansas courts have recognized the clarifying amendment exception to the presumption against retroactivity involving amendments designed purely to clarify the meaning of a prior enactment. Based on the legislative history of the amendment, the court held that the amendment was intended to clarify the existing law and that retroactive application to defendant's case did not prejudice his substantive rights and, thus, did not violate due process. The court found that application of the amendment only resulted in defendant receiving the sentence for attempted rape he would have received had it been his only crime of conviction. The court rejected defendant's claim that the State had waived or abandoned its right to seek resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court order denying the State's motion to correct defendant's sentence and remanded the case with directions for the trial court to resentence defendant for attempted rape as the primary conviction, with credit for time served.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 60-1501 (2004 Supp.) and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 (2000). The inmate appealed the dismissal by the Leavenworth District Court for failure to state a claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kansas Department of Corrections (KDOC) raised failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA); immunity under the Kansas Tort Claims Act; failure to state a claim under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-212(b)(6); qualified immunity under federal law; and immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. The trial court held the inmate to a heightened standard of pleading because KDOC had raised qualified immunity as a defense. The trial court determined the inmate had not met that standard and had failed to state a claim. Applying Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-52,138, the trial court found the inmate had not proven exhaustion of administrative remedies. The trial court should not have held the inmate to the heightened standard of pleading as a plaintiff need not overcome an immunity defense in a complaint. Only two grievances (claims Nos. 16 and 20), were exhausted, so the others had to be dismissed without prejudice. His letter was not from a member of the bar, and he stated no facts which would render it privileged. He was mistakenly not let out for the first day of a college class, but later, he refused on his own volition to attend the course.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court affirmed the district court's dismissal with prejudice of claims Nos. 16 and 20. The district court's dismissal with prejudice of the remainder of the claims, however, was reversed and remanded. On remand, the district court was directed to dismiss the inmate's remaining claims without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3506(a)(1) and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3511(a)(1). The court stated that in multiple acts cases, controlling case law required that if, as here, it was determined that factually separate incidents had been alleged, failure to give a unanimity instruction must be deemed harmless if the defendant had presented a unified defense to all of those acts. Defendant attempted but failed to persuade the court that his defense was not unified because of questions as to proper venue for some of the acts alleged. That was not persuasive because there was no objection as to venue for any of the acts, nor was the argument made at any time before the jury's verdicts. Further, rational relationships existed between both Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3506(a)(1) and Kan. Stat.

The creditor again requested the bench warrant to be issued without an affidavit. The creditor relied on Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61-3608 (Supp. 2004). The trial court denied the request, relying on Local Rule 23 for the 16th Judicial District. On appeal, the court noted that an appellate court had unlimited review over questions of statutory construction. The court presumed that the legislature did not enact useless or meaningless legislation. Local Rule 23 and &sect; 61-3608 were inconsistent and in conflict with one another. Pursuant to Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 105, the statute necessarily trumped the local rule. Local Rule 23 was therefore invalid.

Initially and on remand, the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) entered judgment in favor of SRS and upheld the constitutionality of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 38-1512 and 39-718b.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's children were adjudged children in need of care (CINC) and placed in the custody of SRS. SRS sought reimbursement of the children's expenses while they were in SRS custody. The mother argued that the recoupment statutes violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution by arbitrarily burdening the parents of CINC children with the cost of public assistance, thereby jeopardizing the success of reintegration. The appellate court determined that the rational basis test applied and found that the statutes allowing SRS to recoup from a parent of reintegrated children the expenses for care of that parent's children while in out-of-home placement did not violate equal protection mandates. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 38-1512, 39-701, and 39-718b fostered and protected the universal duty of parents to support their children, and the scheme for recoupment under these statutes bore a rational relationship to the valid legislative goals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After entering an apartment in which defendant was present, officers detected a strong odor of burnt marijuana. They observed a partially burnt marijuana cigar positioned on top of open digital scales, an open box of cigars, and a pair of scissors. Defendant waived his rights under Miranda and agreed to speak with the officers. At trial, defendant's statements to the police were admitted. On appeal, defendant raised two issues: he claimed (1) that the introduction at trial of his statements violated the confrontation clauses of state and federal constitutions and (2) that attorney fees and an administrative fee were imposed in contravention of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4513(b) (Supp. 2004) because there was no consideration of financial resources. The appellate court noted that the Confrontation Clause did not apply when a court was dealing with the admission of a defendant's confession. Defendant did not have a constitutional right to confront himself. As to the fees, &sect; 22-4513(b) permitted a defendant at any time to petition to waive all or part of the costs. Defendant failed to do this; the appellate court concluded he had not been prejudiced, and his appeal was premature.</SPAN></P>

Even if the jury had heard about defendant's medical condition and the fact that it could have caused someone to be impaired, it would still not have contradicted the uncontroverted evidence that defendant had a blood alcohol level of .20. The trial court had a legitimate interest in admitting only reliable evidence and did not abuse its discretion by prohibiting defendant from testifying about his medical condition. Further, the trial court did not infringe upon defendant's constitutional right to testify on his own behalf or present a defense; he had the opportunity to offer factual testimony or to call an expert to offer medical testimony, but did not do so.</SPAN></P>

Eighteen months later the inmate moved to correct an illegal sentence under Kan. Stat. Ann. 22-3504(1), relying on new case law. He also moved to file an out of time appeal. The Rice District Court, Kansas, denied motions, and the inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that he should have been sentenced for a level 3 offense rather than a level 1 offense because new case law held that the charge under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4159(a) had identical elements to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4161(a), a lower level offense, resulting in a lesser penalty. The court declined, however, to apply that case retroactively on collateral review. State courts were under no constitutional duty to apply criminal decisions retroactively, and a defendant had no constitutional right to a lesser sentence when two crimes had the same elements. The court reversed, however, as to the ruling that the inmate had no right to file an out of time appeal. The inmate claimed that he was not advised of his right to appeal from his guilty plea, and the district court did not make a finding on that issue. Further, the transcript from sentencing did not indicate the inmate was informed of his right to appeal by the district court as required by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3424(f). The court was obligated to remand for an Ortiz hearing to determine if the inmate was advised of his right to appeal from his guilty plea and whether he requested that an appeal be filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county argued that an appraisal that was made when the taxpayer's project originally was being financed fell within the exceptions provided in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-460(g), (h), or (i) (2003 Supp.). The court held that the trial court erred in concluding that the appraisal was inadmissible because the Kansas Rules of Evidence did not apply. Tax appeal proceedings before BOTA were controlled by the Kansas Administrative Procedure Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-501 et seq. Furthermore, the trial court had substituted its judgment for that of BOTA rather than simply examining the record to determine if substantial evidence supported BOTA's actions. In view of the fact that the taxpayer had agreed with the County's use of the cost approach; the fact of the amount the taxpayer paid for its building and lot a few years earlier; the fact of the amount for which the taxpayer insured the improvements on the property, which was more than the claimed combined value of the land and improvement; and other evidence in the record, including the appraisal, the court could not conclude that BOTA was arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious in finding substantial evidence to support the value it found.</SPAN></P>

For example, one of the runaways was described as 14 years old, 5 feet, 6 inches tall, 130 pounds, with long sandy blond hair. The other was reported as 12 years old, 5 feet, 8 inches tall, 100 pounds, dark brown shoulder-length hair, and wearing a blue, white, and gray horizontal striped shirt. On the other hand, defendant was 22 years old, 5 feet tall, 110 pounds, dark brown shoulder-length hair fashioned in corn rows, and wearing a red shirt and blue jeans. Defendant's sister, was 17 years old, 5 feet, 4 inches tall, dark brown hair just past shoulder length fashioned in a bun, and wearing a white shirt with black horizontal pin stripes and dark pants.

The board was only required to show that he was unlawfully practicing the healing arts without being licensed to do so. Further his continued use of the M.D. designation could clearly cause irreparable harm by misleading the public. The proposed injunction would not violate the dentist's rights to freedom of speech and equal protection because the use of M.D. was obviously misleading and it was used for more than commercial speech, and finally, restricting the use of M.D. was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that the use of local option sales tax revenue for public education was contrary to the Kansas School District Finance and Quality Performance Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-6405 et seq., and created unconstitutional disparities in funding. The court questioned whether the objecting districts and parents had standing to bring the action. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-907, which permitted injunctive relief against the levy and collection of illegal taxes, did not authorize a court to enjoin the distribution and receipt of revenues from a sales tax that had already been levied and partially collected. Moreover, taxpayer status and payment of the sales tax did not confer standing. As to a claim that competitive disadvantage to schools conferred standing, an evidentiary hearing was appropriate. The district court reasonably found no likelihood of success on the merits because the school finance statutory scheme preserved some degree of local autonomy at the expense of statewide equity. The court declined to consider the constitutional claims. Irreparable harm was not shown, the balance of harm was equal, and temporary injunctive relief would be adverse to the public interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of temporary injunctive relief and remanded for an evidentiary hearing and legal determination as to the issue of standing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for possession of cocaine, claiming that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence. The evidence was seized incident to defendant's arrest on a parole warrant which was later determined to be invalid. Defendant also claimed that the stipulated evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction and that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss based upon an alleged statutory speedy trial violation. The court disagreed and affirmed, stating that defendant's placement on post-release supervision was valid because the initial order had never been canceled. Thus, the arrest warrant issued by the Kansas Department of Corrections was lawful and validated the search incident to the arrest. Further, the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule provided an additional basis for upholding the search of defendant's person after his arrest. In the absence of any evidence that defendant's possession of cocaine was accidental, the stipulated evidence was sufficient to support his condition for possession of cocaine. His trial continuance was appropriate when initially granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Shawnee County District Court, Kansas, dismissed appellant church's action against appellee Kansas Board of Tax Appeals (BOTA) members. The district court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the church failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and failed to take a proper appeal under the Kansas Act for Judicial Review and Civil Enforcement of Agency Actions (KJRA), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-601 et seq. The church appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church claimed that the district court improperly dismissed its claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The appellate court noted that the KJRA was the exclusive remedy for review of agency actions, unless the agency was specifically exempted by statute. Because Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-2426 provided a process for review of BOTA's orders, a separate claim for declaratory or injunctive relief was not available. The church was required to exhaust administrative remedies before BOTA by completing the process on its pending tax exemption application and then, if necessary, seek an appeal. The church failed to establish that there was a constitutional right to voir dire of administrative board members and had not asserted any facts demonstrating actual bias on the part of BOTA members or that the existing statute for disqualification was inadequate. Without evidence of bias or prejudice, there was no reason voir dire was required. Because BOTA members were statutorily subject to the rules of judicial conduct applicable to all judges of the district court, the Board members may and would recuse themselves as they thought necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had cataract problems. He terminated his involvement in a sex offender treatment program based on his poor eyesight. As a result, he lost incentives related to the program. When the inmate was transferred to another prison, he sought a reinstatement of the lost incentives. His request for cataract surgery was denied. Thereafter, he filed an action against the wardens asserting several causes of action. The inmate sought review after the actions were summarily dismissed. On appeal, the court dismissed the action relating to habeas corpus because it was untimely under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1501 (Supp. 2003). However, the claims brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the ADA were not subject to the same time limitation. The inmate's &sect; 1983 claim failed due to the inability to demonstrate a violation of the United States Constitution or federal law. The loss of incentives did not infringe upon a recognizable property or liberty interest. Further, an excessive risk to the inmate's health was not ignored by removing him from the program. Finally, the inmate did not show a violation of the ADA because he did not request an accommodation before withdrawing from the program.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Wyandotte District Court (Kansas), which convicted him of three counts of aggravated indecent liberties with a child, three counts of aggravated indecent liberties with a second child, and one count of sexual exploitation of a child. He was sentenced to 228 months in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that defendant's flight could be considered in determining guilt. The instruction employed by the trial court was specifically disapproved by the Kansas Supreme Court, and the rationale for prohibiting such an instruction was that it emphasized and singled out certain evidence rather than leaving to the jury the significance and weight of all the evidence presented. Consequently, the court had no alternative other than to reverse defendant's conviction and remand the case for a new trial. The court further found, however, that there was more than adequate evidence to support conviction for at least six separate incidents of aggravated indecent liberties. The court disagreed that the evidence was too &quot;vague,&quot; especially because lewd fondling or touching did not require contact with the sex organ of one or the other. Finally, the court found that the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of theft, flight, and prior crimes. While the flight instruction was clearly erroneous, the admissibility of that evidence was not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operating agreement provided for preferential rights to purchase. The operator, alleging that oil and gas leasehold interests were sold in breach of such rights, brought suit on behalf of those with preferential rights. The trial court found that the sale did not fall within an exception to the preferential rights provision and granted summary judgment to the operator against the seller. The trial court dismissed the buyer from the litigation, finding it to be a bona fide purchaser. The court held that the operator was a real party in interest, pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-217(a), with standing to pursue others' preferential rights claims. The buyer was not a bona fide purchaser, however, because it had actual notice that the interests were subject to preferential rights. Under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-3404(1), the rule against perpetuities did not apply to a commercial transaction. Although the bill enacting &sect; 59-3404 dealt with various uniform laws, it did not violate the one-subject rule of Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 16 because matters of legislative merit were not tied to unworthy matters. The trial court had inherent authority to sanction the seller for discovery misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling that the operator had standing to enforce the preferential rights provision, affirmed a sanctions award, reversed the determination that the buyer was a bona fide purchaser, and remanded with instructions to determine whether there was any impediment to specific performance of the preferential rights covenant.</SPAN></P>

The state court of appeals rejected his argument that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3522(a)(2) (2002) was unconstitutional because it impermissibly discriminated between heterosexual and homosexual sodomy. The United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded to the state court of appeals for further consideration in light of Lawrence v. Texas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, then 18, performed oral sex on another developmentally disabled male, aged 14. Defendant was charged with criminal sodomy under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3505(a)(2). He moved to dismiss, arguing he should have been charged with unlawful voluntary sexual relations under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3522, which was a less severe level of felony, and that, because gay teenagers were excluded from the protection of &sect; 21-3522, the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause. The appellate court disagreed. Lawrence v. Texas was factually and legally distinguishable, as it involved two adult homosexuals and a due process, not an equal protection, challenge. The State had a compelling interest in the well-being of its children and their protection. The Kansas Legislature could have rationally determined that heterosexual sodomy between a child and an adult could be dealt with differently than homosexual sodomy between a child and an adult, as the latter could disturb the traditional sexual development of children. Defendant failed to show that &sect; 21-3522 unlawfully discriminated based on sexual orientation or gender or that his sentence was unconstitutionally disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cases were not brought to trial within the 60-day time frame set forth in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-29a06 (2002 Supp.). The court concluded that the 60-day time limit of &sect; 59-29a06 was directory and not mandatory; hence, the failure to bring each case to trial within 60 days of the determination of probable cause did not divest the district court of subject matter jurisdiction. In reaching that conclusion, the court retroactively applied amendments to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 59-29a01, 59-29a06, which provided that the time limit was directory and not jurisdictional, after determining that the legislature intended retroactive application. The court held that retroactive application would not affect vested or substantive rights and thus would not violate due process. The rights at issue were procedural, and the public had a strong interest in prompt and orderly proceedings to determine sexually violent predator status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several individuals who wanted to buy homes made payments to a company controlled by defendant. These individuals were told that the company would either loan them money or arrange for a loan. The company never made any loans or closed any real estate transactions. Defendant contended that he was not responsible for any misleading statements and that he did not act as a loan broker as defined in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 50-1001(c). The court concluded, however, that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that defendant violated Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 50-1002 by taking payments from the company's clients and promising to assist them in obtaining a loan. Because the jury was clearly instructed on the State's burden of proof, the lack of an affirmative defense instruction regarding defendant's claim that he was exempt from loan broker registration was not clearly erroneous. Including the dollar amount in the elements instruction did not cause the crime of loan broker fraud under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 50-1017 to be multiplicitous with the crime of theft by deception under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3701 (2002 Supp.). A clerical error on the jury form did not render the verdicts inconsistent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, vacated defendant's sentence because the State conceded that an upward departure sentence was erroneously imposed, and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that counsel was ineffective for not objecting at the preliminary hearing. The trial court, in denying the motion, stated that there was no constitutional right to confront witnesses at a preliminary hearing. The court affirmed the conviction, observing that &sect; 22-2902(3) authorized the admission of hearsay evidence regarding statements made by a victim less than 13 years of age. Thus, defense counsel would have had no grounds to object to the admission of the hearsay testimony at the preliminary hearing. Moreover, after a conviction, any error at the preliminary hearing was deemed harmless unless the error caused prejudice at trial. Because the victim testified at trial, the alleged error was harmless. Defendant was not denied his right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VI, because he had an opportunity to cross-examine the victim at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted of aggravated burglary, aggravated kidnapping, rape, and aggravated criminal sodomy. Defendant filed a petition for writ of mandamus against appellees, the department of corrections and a department official, complaining of a retaliatory transfer to an out-of-state prison. The Shawnee District Court, Kansas, refused to permit the filing of the inmate's writ of mandamus. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the inmate challenged the trial court's refusal to permit the filing of his petition. The appellate court found that the trial court did not err in finding that the inmate had not exhausted his administrative remedies. Contrary to the inmate's contention, the appellate court did not find that the administrative grievance procedure was legally inadequate. Nor did the trial court err in concluding that mandamus was inappropriate, as the department of corrections had discretion under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3002, art. IV in deciding whether to transfer the inmate to another state prison. The act of transferring the inmate to an interstate prison was not a legally specified duty that was properly the subject of a mandamus action, as the statutory provisions utilized broad language for interstate prison transfers and imposed no conditions or standards that restricted the department's discretion to transfer the inmate. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the inmate had no protected liberty interest to remain in a Kansas prison.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First, the court held that the case was moot as to the governor; but, because the issue was both capable of repetition and one of public importance, the court addressed the merits of the case. The press took the position that the governor-elect's transition office (GETO) was an agency of the state under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-4318(a) and that the budget task force was its subordinate group. The court disagreed. The GETO did not appear to be a state agency as the term was generally defined by the legislature. It was neither expressly created by statute nor expressly authorized by the legislature to perform some acts or duties. Even if GETO were a state agency, the task force was not its subordinate group. The task force was formed by the governor-elect, individually, and except for the assignment of certain GETO staff members to the task force, the two were not connected. Finally, if it had taken an amendment to KOMA pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-4318(a) (Supp. 2002) to make a governor's task force subject to KOMA, then it followed that an incoming governor's task force or advisory committee was not subject to KOMA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's judgment, denying declaratory relief; the court did not reach the cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3414, and simple assault. Respondent challenged the constitutionality of the aggravated battery statute and argued that the record provided insufficient evidence to support an adjudication of aggravated battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an initial matter, the court found that respondent timely filed the notice of appeal, calculated from the date of the journal entry of sentencing. The court noted that the order had to be mailed to respondent and that, therefore, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-206 (2002 Supp.), the time for filing the notice of appeal was extended by 3 days, if necessary. Respondent was convicted for shooting a victim in the leg with a pellet gun. He claimed that he had pointed and fired the gun downward and that the pellet ricocheted and hit the victim. Although finding that the pellet gun could not be categorized as a deadly weapon, the district court found that respondent's actions constituted aggravated battery under the provision that defined the crime as the reckless infliction of bodily harm upon another in a manner whereby great bodily harm, disfigurement, or death could result. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the evidence was sufficient for the aggravated battery conviction under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3414(a)(2)(B). The court also held that because &quot;reckless&quot; carried a settled legal meaning, the new &quot;reckless&quot; subsection of &sect; 21-3414 was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court instructed the inmate to file an application to proceed in forma pauperis and pay a filing fee of $ 3 pursuant to Kan.

The court affirmed the dismissal order, observing that &sect; 60-2001(b)(1) authorized a debit to an inmate's account for payment of a docket fee, even if the account lacked funds. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by dismissing the inmate's lawsuit for his refusal to pay the fee. The court further held that the docket fee requirement for inmates did not deprive an inmate of the constitutional right to adequate, effective, and meaningful access to the courts. Moreover, &sect; 60-2001(b)(1) did not violate an inmate's right to procedural due process and did not deprive an inmate of equal protection of the law. The court declined to assess costs and attorney fees against the inmate under Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 7.07(a) or under Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was injured in a car accident on August 15, 1996, and she notified the insurer. The insured was assigned a claim number and was informed that the insurer paid a portion of her medical bills. The insurer also paid her some work disability benefits before denying subsequent claims for personal injury protection benefits (PIP). The insured filed a pro se suit to recover further PIP benefits on August 13, 2001. The insurer moved to dismiss the case, arguing the insured failed to meet the two-year deadline set forth in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-3110(a). The district court agreed and dismissed the insured's suit. The key issue on appeal was what was meant by the term &quot;claim&quot; in &sect; 40-3110(a). The insured notified the insurer of her claim well before the two-year deadline of &sect; 40-3110(a). She was assigned a claim number and was paid some of her PIP benefits. Under these circumstances, the district court erred in applying &sect; 40-3110(a) as a statute of limitation governing the filing time for her later lawsuit over additional PIP benefits. The insured was correct that the applicable limitation period was five years under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-511(1) governing written contracts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the woman was a willing participant until after penetration occurred, and, thus, it was not rape. The issue of whether consent may be withdrawn after penetration was one of first impression in Kansas. The appellate court stated that, quite simply, sexual intercourse performed when one participant was under force or fear was rape. It did not matter if the force or fear existed at the initiation of the act or whether it came after consent was withdrawn. The act was rape under either circumstance. Defendant next argued that, even if rape could occur after consensual penetration, a defendant must have a reasonable time in which to act on the victim's withdrawal of consent. The appellate court disagreed and stated that, when consent was withdrawn, continuing sexual intercourse for 5 to 10 minutes was not reasonable and constituted rape. Finally, defendant contended that the State failed to prove that the woman's participation in the intercourse was because of force or fear. However, the woman testified that she verbally and physically attempted to end the intercourse. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to find defendant guilty of rape.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a notice of appeal after the 10-day limitation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3608(c), and the court ordered briefing of the jurisdiction issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who ran a club, was convicted after a neighbor complained that he heard loud noises from rock bands from 9:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. On the jurisdiction issue, the court held that suspending imposition of the sentence did not alter the effective date of sentencing for running of the appeal clock and that the appeal could be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. However, for reasons of judicial economy, the court addressed the issues raised and held that: (1) just because the club had a cabaret license to provide live entertainment for guests did not mean it had a total exemption from the enforcement of the loud noise ordinance, as the license itself made clear; (2) the exception in Ordinance 7.41.010(b)(1) referred to an authorization a particular event and therefore did not apply; (3) the measurement provisions made certain levels of noise presumptively a violation, but there could be violations without the measurements, if the factfinder determined the prohibited conduct occurred; and (4) the ordinance contained a reasonable-persons standard without leaving the door open for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and thus was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to attempted robbery, felony marijuana possession, theft, and two counts of endangering a child. The Sedgwick County District Court (Kansas) granted 36 months' probation and imposed two 16 month prison terms on the felonies, to run concurrently, and 12 month terms on each of the three misdemeanors, to run consecutive to each other and the felony prison term. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that consecutive sentences on the misdemeanors were illegal. The State contended that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4608(a) controlled. Defendant argued that &sect; 21-4608(a) did not apply because the definition of &quot;imprisonment&quot; under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4703(m) did not include sentences that were served in a county jail. The court agreed with the State. The definition statute for sentencing did not include the term &quot;imprisonment.&quot; The term &quot;imprisonment&quot; was not defined by where the sentence would be served. The term &quot;imprisonment&quot; applied to both misdemeanor and felony sentences. The trial court had authority to impose consecutive &quot;imprisonment&quot; sentences on the misdemeanor offenses under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4608(a). While reasonable persons could have differed with the decision, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences. Lastly, the trial court's imposition of an increased probation term was not a departure under Apprendi or an appealable sentence under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4611(c)(5) (2002 Supp.). Neither did it exceed the statutory maximum probation term under &sect; 21-4611(c)(6) (2002 Supp.).</SPAN></P>

He was charged with sexual exploitation of a child and eavesdropping. After his conviction, defendant sought review. In affirming the eavesdropping conviction, the court determined that a parent had the constitutional right to control children. As such, the rights of parents were superior to that of their children. However, the parents' rights were limited to situations where a parent had a good faith basis that was objectively reasonable for believing that the child's rights must have been abridged in furtherance of parental duties. Here, defendant was unable to show a reason for spying on the child in the bathroom. The court vacated defendant's other conviction. The citation error in the amended information did not require a reversal of the case. However, the court determined that the facts of the case were insufficient to support a conviction under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3516(a)(2) (Supp. 2002). Because the child was unaware that she was being taped, she was not engaged in sexually explicit conduct or an exhibition of nudity.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer also sought tax refunds. The BOTA ruled that the property was not exempt. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the contract, the taxpayer retained all title to the property and was paid on a fee-per-picture basis. There was no option to buy the property. Under Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1(b), property used exclusively for state and county purposes was exempt from property taxes. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201a,2 (Supp. 2002) provided exemptions from property and ad valorem taxes for property used exclusively by the State of Kansas or any political subdivision and provided that property that was leased without an option to buy was not &quot;used exclusively&quot; by the State or its political subdivisions. The taxpayer argued that these exemptions applied and that a lease contract was not involved. The court agreed with the BOTA that the contract was a lease, as the taxpayer gave up possession and use of the property in exchange for valuable consideration while retaining the right to retake the property at the end of the contract. The statute's definition of &quot;used exclusively&quot; also applied to Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1(b) and made sense under the simultaneous use rule, as leasing the property for profit constituted a use that was simultaneous with the government's use. The property was not tax exempt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the trial court properly reviewed the evidence to determine whether the victim of the gunshot wound suffered &quot;bodily harm&quot; or &quot;great bodily harm,&quot; as the determining factor as to the severity level of aggravated battery. Having concluded that the wound constituted &quot;great bodily harm&quot; as a matter of law, the trial court properly refused to give lesser included instructions on severity levels 7 and 8 &quot;bodily harm&quot; aggravated battery. Defendant argued that an instruction that great bodily harm meant a &quot;through and through bullet wound&quot; violated his constitutional rights by not requiring every element of the crime charged to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt and created a mandatory presumption that removed a required element from the case in violation of Apprendi. In rejecting defendant's argument, a majority of the court held that the definitional instruction did neither and that Apprendi was not applicable to the facts. Finally, there was no error in disallowing a physician's testimony on disfigurement, which was not an issue in the case, or his opinion on whether the wound amounted to great bodily harm, an inadmissible legal conclusion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The escapee did not argue or allege that his sentence of 53 months was grossly disproportionate to the crime of aggravated escape from custody, an Eighth Amendment violation. He alleged that his sentence of 53 months was more severe than the punishments administered to other individuals who escaped from facilities other than a state correctional facility. As such, the escapee could not show that &sect; 21-3810 burdened his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Without a showing that &sect; 21-3810 targeted a suspect class or burdened a fundamental right, the escapee's equal protection claim was examined under the rational basis test. The Kansas Legislature apparently believed that individuals who escaped from state correctional facilities posed a greater threat to society than those who escaped from security hospitals or county jails. Applying the deferential rational basis scrutiny, the instant court found that &sect; 21-3810 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee mother filed two petitions against appellant father, one for protection from abuse, and the other for a determination of parentage. The actions were consolidated in the Johnson District Court, Kansas, which issued judgment for the mother on the abuse petition and for past child care expenses in the paternity action, and ordered the father to pay child support. The father appealed from the district court's decisions in both cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal the father argued that although the order for protection expired by its own terms, his appeal should not be dismissed as moot since his rights under state and federal law to possess a firearm would continue to be adversely affected. The court disagreed, finding that the father was no longer a person &quot;subject to a court order&quot; with respect to 18 U.S.C. &sect; 922(g)(8) and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-3112 (2001 Supp.). The court also found that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting sole custody of the youngest daughter to the mother and denying the father visitation with his daughter. Although the district court did not find in the protection from abuse action that he had sexually abused his own daughter, it did find that he had sexually abused her two half-sisters. The court also concluded that an unwed custodial parent could recover past expenses for the child's support and education from the noncustodial parent, not just birth expenses, but that the district court erred in increasing monthly child support payments in an apparent attempt to force the father to reimburse the mother for her cost of living expenses which were not related to those of the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed as moot all issues raised in connection with the protection from abuse action, reversed the district court's order increasing the Kansas Child Support Guidelines presumed child support amount and remanded on that issue for a redetermination of the proper child support, and affirmed the judgments and orders of the district court in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the persistent sex offender statute was unconstitutional because it created a departure scheme whereby facts not found by a jury were used to exceed the statutory maximum sentence. The court disagreed, holding that defendant's sentences under the persistent sex offender statute did not violate Apprendi or Gould. There was no violation of Apprendi because enhancement of his sentences based on his prior offense fell within the Almendarez-Torres exception to Apprendi for use of prior convictions, and there was no violation of Gould because enhancement of his sentences based on his current crimes of conviction for sexually violent crimes did not violate Kan.

The mother argued that visitation was not in the child's best interest. The father did not oppose visitation. After the district court allowed visitation, the mother sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the district court erred in granting visitation to the spouse. Under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-129, visitation rights were limited only to the parents of the child's natural mother or father. Moreover, the district court erred when it concluded that one of the children would have had a substantial relationship with the natural grandparent, if the mother had not interfered. The natural grandparent had the burden of establishing that a substantial relationship existed. In addition, the district court should have given deference to the mother's decision to prohibit visitation. The court noted that the district court did not make sufficient findings under &sect; 38-129. Without the findings, the court was unable to determine the weight that should have been afforded to the parents' conflicting decisions. Finally, the district court should have articulated why the mother's decision was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The mother testified that, while the grandmother did have significant contact with the older grandchild the first two years of her life, she saw the first grandchild less since the second grandchild was born. The grandmother testified to only four or five visits with the second grandchild. The mother opposed the visitation, as appellees smoked around the children, despite her requests that they refrain from doing so, and because the grandmother belittled the mother in front of the children. The mother invited the grandmother to go on outings with them, but the grandmother refused. The grandmother also admitted to offering negative information about the mother to the children's father so that he could obtain more visitation. The appellate court reversed the trial court's grant of visitation to the step-grandfather, as he was not a grandparent under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-129.

Any alleged coercive tactics used by law enforcement officers in the initial interview with the witness were too attenuated from the second interview two weeks later to raise doubt concerning the voluntary nature of the witness's statements. During the second interview, no false documents were presented. While the witness admitted to using methamphetamine and alcohol prior to the interviews, the witness testified that the use of those substances did not hamper his understanding of the questions posed to him. Consequently, there was no evidence from which to conclude that the witness's statements were not the product of his own free and independent desire to relate the events of the murder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated indecent liberties with a child and three counts of criminal sodomy. The Saline District Court (Kansas) sentenced defendant to 88 months on the primary offense, the sentences on the lesser charges were to run concurrently, and found the primary offense was sexually motivated and departed to a post-release supervision period of 60 months. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the sentence constituted an unconstitutional departure. Defendant's guilty pleas resulted from incidents involving sexual intercourse, including vaginal and anal penetration, and oral sex with a 14-year-old female. The appellate court ruled that the trial court was within its authority to order 60 months of post-release supervision, as the pleas of guilty to aggravated indecent liberties and criminal sodomy were obviously pleas of guilty to sexually motivated or sexually violent crimes. As such, there was a factual finding in the legal proceeding below that would satisfy the requirements of Apprendi and Gould. Defendant's plea to a charge of aggravated indecent liberties was a plea to a crime that was sexually violent and sexually motivated by definition. No inference from the pleas to reach a finding of factors supporting an upward departure was necessary. Once the statutory nature of the crime was determined, the provisions of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3717(d)(1)(D)(i) (Supp. 2001) could be applied. There was no need for any evidentiary fact finding by the trial court, which was prohibited by Apprendi and Gould.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction, as the State did not prove that he possessed pure ephedrine. The court of appeals disagreed. Interpreting Kan. Stat. Ann. 65-7006(a) (2001 Supp.) to prohibit possession of only pure ephedrine would have been to include language that was not readily found in the statute.&nbsp;Section 65-7006(a) was a general statute that addressed not only pure ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, but also drug products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. Such an interpretation was consistent with the legislative intent of the statute to prohibit the use of otherwise legal drugs containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine in the manufacture of illegal substances. As a result, &sect; 65-7006(a) was not limited to the possession of pure ephedrine. In addition, a forensic chemist with the Kansas Bureau of Investigation testified that the pills recovered from the defendant contained ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. After review of all the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, a rational factfinder could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his girlfriend spent the evening at a bar drinking. When they left, defendant needed assistance getting to his car. Although the facts were in dispute as to how it was decided who would drive the car, defendant drove the car away from the bar. Defendant crashed the car into a utility pole, and the girlfriend's arm was ripped off by the seatbelt. At trial, the prosecutor referred to the accident in his opening statement as &quot;defendant's reckless stupid act of driving while intoxicated,&quot; commented on defendant's credibility, and talked about how defendant lied. Defendant did not object to the remarks. The appellate court held that, while the State could argue that the jury should arrive at a single finding of fact based upon the state of the evidence, it could not comment on defendant's credibility. Due to the overwhelming evidence at trial, however, that defendant did drive the car while intoxicated, the prosecutor's remarks did not likely affect the outcome of the trial and were not reversible error. Defendant was not entitled to an instruction on voluntary intoxication, as the charge of aggravated battery was a crime of general and not specific intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State had agreed to dismiss rape charges and recommend a concurrent sentence on the aggravated range of the appropriate grid box.

The offense had an aggravated range of 64 months' imprisonment under the sentencing grid. The trial court imposed an upward departure and sentenced defendant to 162 months' imprisonment. The appellate court held that upward durational departures were unconstitutional and the trial court erred in imposing an upward departure sentence. Defendant also complained that a conviction for larceny should not have been included in his criminal history score because the crime was committed when he was 16 years old. He argued that this conviction violated his equal protection rights. The subsequent change in the jurisdiction of the juvenile court was not retroactive.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his sentencing by the Geary District Court (Kansas) following his conviction of two counts of forgery. He argued the trial court erred in taking judicial notice of his presentence investigation (PSI) report filed for conviction under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4714(f) (2000 Supp.). He claimed, inter alia, that his California conviction for burglary should have been categorized as a nonperson felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to two counts of forgery. In return, the State agreed to dismiss the remaining charges in both cases. Defendant's PSI report showed he had nine prior convictions. He had convictions for a California burglary which was a person felony, as well as some other nonperson felonies and misdemeanors. Prior to sentencing, defendant filed an objection to his criminal history, stating his California conviction of burglary was a nonperson felony. The State responded that he had failed to object when the PSI report, including the California conviction, was filed and the court could then take judicial notice of the earlier PSI report. The appellate court held the trial court took judicial notice of the PSI report in the prior case and found defendant's criminal history score to be accurate. The trial court did not err in taking judicial notice of defendant's previously filed PSI report instead of requiring the State to produce evidence to establish the disputed portion of the criminal history by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court since defendant did not allege any violations of his due process rights in connection with his juvenile proceeding.

He also asserted the trial court unconstitutionally imposed an upward durational departure sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was on suicide watch at a detention center, screaming obscenities and urinating on his cell floor. Several members of the staff attempted to deliver medication to defendant when he threw a cup of toilet water on a deputy's arm and chest. At trial, defendant objected to the trial court's jury instruction, arguing it removed the necessary element of intent to actually touch a person. The appellate court held the jury instruction, that it was possible that defendant's intention to throw the liquid without any companion intention to hit someone other than himself could equal battery, misstated Kansas law. Thus, the instruction was error. The trial court's omission of the standard general intent instruction aggravated the error. The appellate court also noted that even if the conviction had been upheld, the sentence would have been vacated since it required a jury determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved a proposal for the distribution of ad valorem tax refunds mandated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) had first ordered that whenever possible an attempt should be made to distribute the refunds to customers who paid the taxes. That order stated, however, that the energy group's distribution plan was approved with clarification. The order stated that the parties should retain the refunds in commission-approved accounts, pending final disposition by issuance of a final order no longer subject to any appeal or petition for review. Subsequently, the KCC modified its order to provide that all refunds be distributed to only to low-income residential gas customers. On appeal, the energy group argued that the KCC erred by reversing a final order that had been in existence for more than one year, and when it refused to give a refund to the customers who paid the charges. The appellate court held the first order of the KCC was not a final order and the KCC had the authority to modify it. Moreover, there was no statute prohibiting the KCC from ordering distribution of the ad valorem tax refund to low-income individuals.</SPAN></P>

The Saline District Court (Kansas) accepted the plea, found defendant guilty, and imposed the recommended sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held defendant's sentence was without statutory authority, because of the supreme court's holding that the statutory basis for imposing upward departures under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4716(a) (Supp. 2000), was unconstitutional in its face. Therefore, defendant's sentence was illegal. However, defendant had entered a negotiated plea agreement. In this case, the appellate court held where the plea agreement included an agreement to recommend to the court an illegal sentence, and the sentencing court imposed the recommended but illegal sentence, and the illegal sentence impermissibly increased the defendant's term of imprisonment, the State could either allow the defendant to withdraw his or her guilty plea or agree that the illegal portion of the sentence be vacated and the defendant be resentenced to the proper lesser term. However, the appellate court rejected defendant's argument that his probationary period should have been reduced, as that issue was not presented to the district court, and the department of corrections, not the district court, had the authority to modify the length of defendant's postrelease supervision time.</SPAN></P>

Here, the mother proposed visitation on Sundays from noon to seven p.m. every three or four weeks. The court ordered visitation one Saturday per month for eight hours. That was not a significant difference. The trial court did not make findings in sufficient detail to enable the court of appeals to determine why the mother's proposed visitation schedule was not adopted. Absent findings of unreasonableness, the trial court should have adopted the grandparent visitation plan proposed by a fit parent. Therefore, the trial court erred by failing to adopt the mother's proposed plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated assault in the Douglas District Court (Kansas) and was sentenced to 22 months in prison. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court imposed an illegal sentence when it calculated his criminal history under the Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act (KSGA), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4701 et seq., using a juvenile adjudication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A presentence investigation report showed defendant's criminal history included no adult convictions, but did include a juvenile adjudication for aggravated battery, a person felony. Defendant believed the increase in his sentence by 13 months due to the inclusion of his juvenile adjudication in his criminal history was illegal, as he did not have a right to a jury trial when that adjudication was made. The appellate court noted the statute that required the inclusion of juvenile adjudications in calculating a defendant's criminal history, and which defendant alleged was unconstitutional, was Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4710. Citing precedent, the appellate court noted that juveniles had no constitutional right to a jury trial, and that the granting of a jury trial for a juvenile was entirely at the trial court's option. The appellate court held that the use of defendant's juvenile adjudication in calculating his criminal history score was not in conflict with the Kansas Juvenile Offenders Code, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-1601 et seq., nor did it violate the prohibition against ex post facto application of the law.</SPAN></P>

The Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) entered summary judgment in favor of the pitcher and school, who were held to be immune from liability under the recreational use exception, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-6104(o) (Supp. 1999), of the Kansas Tort Claims Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-6101 et seq. The player appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injury took place as the player was standing either in or near the on-deck circle prior to the beginning of the baseball game. The pitcher was on the mound warming up. At one point, and for reasons not totally clear, the pitcher threw a baseball at the head of the player and struck him on his head. The pitcher maintained that his actions were motivated by instructions given to him by one of the his coaches. The player's petition alleged only simple negligence on the part of one of the managers and coach, who were both employees of the university. The court determined that there was no doubt that the injury to the player was deliberate and unjustifiable. The court ruled that the allegations of simple negligence were not sufficient to overcome the recreational use exception. Absent gross and wanton negligence, the university was immune from liability under the recreational use exception for events that took place at the stadium.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for attempted rape. On appeal he argued, inter alia, that the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) erred when it refused to suppress eyewitness identification evidence and that the trial court's imposition of an upward durational departure sentence and an upward departure of his postrelease supervision was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that when assessing the validity of eyewitness identification, an appellate court must first determine whether the procedure was unnecessarily suggestive. If it was, then the next issue was whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the impermissibly suggestive identification led to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification, constituting a denial of due process. The police in the case at bar did not present defendant to the victim for identification. Instead, the victim spontaneously identified him as her attacker. Because the police did not organize a show-up procedure to obtain an identification of defendant as the attacker, the procedure could not have been unnecessarily suggestive. An upward departure sentence imposed under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4716 (2000 Supp.) was a violation of defendant's Sixth Amendment rights and Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights and, thus, was unconstitutional. The Kansas scheme for imposing upward departure sentences was unconstitutional on its face. Defendant's act of attempted rape constituted a substantial and compelling reason to impose the postrelease supervision departure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted of stalking in the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas). While the defendant's direct appeal of his sentence was pending, the State filed a motion with the trial court to extend the defendant's probation. The trial court granted the motion and the defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially, the court of appeals addressed the issue of whether the trial court had jurisdiction to modify the defendant's sentence while the appeal of that sentence was pending. The court of appeals held that the trial court did have jurisdiction. The defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred because its extension order violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. The court of appeals disagreed.  Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4611 (2000 Supp.) mandated that the sentence for a person convicted of a severity level 10 felony be up to 12 months probation or assignment to a community correctional services program and that that sentence applied retroactively to those already serving a nonprison sentence.  Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4611(c)(5) (2000 Supp.) allowed the district court to increase the length of probation upon certain particularized findings. Such an increase in the length of probation was not to be considered a departure and was not subject to appeal. Therefore, the court of appeals found that they lacked jurisdiction to consider that issue.</SPAN></P>

The victim had a friend live with her, as she needed help with driving, bathing, and other household chores. The victim and defendant were friends. On the night she was raped, the victim fell asleep at a bingo hall due to her medications. The victim did not recall being raped until her roommate asked her why defendant had been in bed with her. The victim later recalled having intercourse and believing it was her boyfriend. The appellate court held that the rape statute did not require the victim to be unconscious in order to convict on a lack of consent theory. The evidence also supported that the victim was mentally and physically impaired due to the effects of her medical conditions and medications and would not have been able to give consent. Defendant's motion for new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel was properly denied, as none of the evidence defendant wanted his attorney to present would have affected the conviction, as it had little to do with the victim's ability to consent.</SPAN></P>

The student also argued that the trial court erred in granting the district's motion for summary judgment, and finding the recreational use of the gymnasium was beyond incidental.

Defendant also contended that the trial court went beyond the maximum prescribed sentence based upon aggravating facts which were not found by a jury or beyond a reasonable doubt, and that his sentence was unconstitutional and illegal.

The cooperative argued that the KCC incorrectly determined that it was required to terminate its certificates pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-1,176(a). However, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-1,176(b) only gave the cooperative the right to continue to provide service after annexation if a new supplier could not promptly assume service. The trial court and the KCC were correct in deciding that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-1,176(a) controlled. The statute conferred legislative power to the city, and it was a local matter which was authorized by Kan.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Colorado commercial fertilizer corporation appealed the dismissal by the Shawnee District Court (Kansas) of its action, claiming Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1994, the corporation registered fertilizer in Kansas, and paid an inspection fee to the KDA under &sect; 2-1205. The KDA wrote the corporation a letter, requesting financial information for the years 1991-1993 to determine if additional fees were owed. The corporation filed suit against the KDA, claiming &sect; 2-1205 was unconstitutional, specifically that it was vague because it did not state who had to register the fertilizer; seeking an injunction to prevent further collection of inspection fees; and seeking a refund of the fee paid. The appellate court held that the corporation had standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 2-1205 by the means of its claim for a refund, because a business faced with the forfeiture of its right to continue business unless it paid the fee, did not pay the fee voluntarily. However, the appellate court agreed with the district court that &sect; 2-1205 was constitutional, because although it did not specifically state who had to register the fertilizer, it made it clear that if one was involved in the fertilizer business, a duty was placed upon that person to ensure the fertilizer was registered and labeled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The BOTA granted the taxpayer a property tax exemption for 43 computer keyboards it purchased to replace defective keyboards.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201w (Supp. 2000) by finding that a replacement keyboard was an item, and the keyboards were exempt from taxation. The appellate court held that summary judgment was proper because the PVD and the county did not bring forth any conflicting evidence, the BOTA issued a memorandum stating that the parties agreed that only an issue of law was maintained in the dispute, and the parties were granted a hearing. The appellate court also held that the BOTA properly interpreted &sect; 79-201w, because its interpretation of the statute did not result in a partial tax exemption, as its interpretation allowed an exemption for any piece of personal property that could or could not constitute a whole mechanism. Finally, legislative history did not lead to the conclusion that the BOTA's statutory interpretation was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

Since there was no contemporaneous objection to the procedure of holding the hearing simultaneously with the trial, the issue was not properly preserved for appellate review. Defendant argued that he was not given a proper hearing on his motion for a downward departure when the sentencing court refused to consider evidence in support of his request. The sentences imposed were within the presumptive ranges provided by law, and the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review them. The trial court denied defendant's mitigation argument, which was not a procedural defect that needed a new sentencing hearing. The appellate court could not review whether defendant's sentence was cruel and unusual punishment, for to do so would nullify Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4721, which barred appeals of presumptive guidelines sentences.

However, the trial judge provided no meaningful opportunity for such an objection, request, motion, or proffer.  Kan. Stat.

It had to be provided at such a time and with such specificity that defendant and the State had a fair opportunity to present their arguments for or against the proposed departure before sentence was pronounced. The frequency of defendant's past criminal activity and the fact that he was released from the youth facility a short time before the arrest constituted substantial and compelling reasons for departure, had notice been sufficient.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On a previous appeal, the appellate court upheld defendant's conviction of rape and two counts of aggravated criminal sodomy, but remanded for resentencing. The defendant moved to set aside his conviction, and the Reno District Court (Kansas), granted defendant a new trial. The State appealed, and defendant's motion to dismiss the appeal was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended the trial court did not comply with the mandate previously issued by the appellate court in the same case, which rejected the defendant's claim of manifest injustice on the basis of his failure to preserve suppression issues for appeal. Defendant countered that the trial court had the inherent and statutory authority to grant a new trial and its order was not subject to interlocutory appeal by the State. The appellate court held that the law of the case doctrine precluded the action taken by the trial court. The trial court's jurisdiction upon remand was limited to compliance with the order from the appellate court to resentence defendant. The trial court was required to proceed in accordance with the mandate and the law of the case as established on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded with directions for resentencing pursuant to the previous mandate of the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant dropped something at the front of his car at the time of his arrest, and the officers found defendant's wallet and two cellophane bags with 23 rocks that contained cocaine. Drug tax stamps were not affixed to the cocaine, and there were no tax stamps in the car, in defendant's wallet, or on his person. The police testified that 23 rocks of cocaine was a large quantity, and the manner in which the rocks were twisted into the corners of the bags was indicative of packaging for sale. Defendant did not request a sufficiency of possession instruction. The appellate court found that: (1) there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions because a rational jury could have concluded that defendant knowingly possessed the cocaine and baggies, that defendant intended to sell the cocaine, and intended to deliver it in the plastic bags; and (2) the district court's failure to give a sufficiency of possession instruction sua sponte was not clearly erroneous because the evidence supported a finding that the defendant had sufficient control over the cocaine to enable him to immediately affix drug tax stamps.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to give a unanimity instruction and in failing to instruct the jury that he had to have had an opportunity to obtain and affix a drug tax stamp. The appellate court held that such instructions were unnecessary because defendant failed to immediately affix a drug tax stamp to the methamphetamine before he was arrested as required by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-5204(c), and he could have purchased a drug tax stamp through the mail. Defendant further contended that the trial court's instruction on the definition of possession improperly shifted the burden of proof. The appellate court found that the instruction on possession did not improperly shift the burden of proof to defendant because the contested paragraph instructed the jury on the type of evidence that could have been considered in determining whether defendant possessed the drugs found in his car, and the State still had to put on evidence of the Cruz factors.</SPAN></P>

A search of defendant's motel room yielded a number of items of drug paraphernalia, components used in the manufacture of methamphetamine, and there was an overwhelming odor of anhydrous ammonia in the room. Defendant shared the motel room with another person, but all of the evidence was lying around in plain view. At trial, there was no evidence that defendant was within the personal use exception of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4101(n) (Supp. 1998). The facts upon which defendant based his prosecutorial misconduct argument were placed in the record by defendant's own attorney. The appellate court found that: (1) defendant's claim that the State was required to negate the personal use exception to establish a prima facie case of drug manufacturing had no merit because the exception was not part of the offense under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4159(a) (Supp. 1998), (2) there was sufficient evidence on which the jury could have found defendant guilty of manufacturing, and possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia, and (3) the prosecutor's comments were harmless error.</SPAN></P>

The jury was given 100 images as evidence although defendant was only charged with 90 counts of exploitation. Separate verdict forms were given for each count. However, there was no requirement the jury indicate upon which picture the defendant was being convicted. The appellate court held the statute did not allow for separate counts on each of the images stored on the disks. In addition, the trial court erred by allowing 100 images to be submitted to the jury with only 90 of them constituting counts since there was no way to determine whether there was a unanimous verdict as to each picture which formed the basis for the charge.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-101 (Supp. 2000), and appellant was not entitled to a spousal share under the laws of intestate succession. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was born male but had a sex change. A new birth certificate had been issued to appellant in Wisconsin indicating sex as female. Appellee, decedent's son, claimed he was the sole heir to decedent because the marriage between decedent and appellant was void under Kansas law. Summary disposition of the question of whether appellant should have been considered a female at the time of marriage was not proper. The district court's treatment of the birth certificate as non-dispositive on the issue of appellant's sex at the time she obtained her Kansas marriage license was affirmed. However, the lower court erred when it concluded that appellant's sex at birth was determinative as to the validity of the parties' marriage. Rather, the trial court should have inquired as to whether, at the time of marriage, appellant was male or female. Genuine issues of material fact also existed on the fraud issue.</SPAN></P>

Appellee board of zoning appeals found that no nonconforming use ever existed on appellant's property and that the previous conditional use permit had been forfeited. Appellant sought review from Marion District Court, Kansas, which affirmed the board's decision. Appellant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county implemented zoning regulations in 1992, locating the existing landfill site in the agricultural zone, which did not permit sanitary landfill uses as-of-right. A conditional use permit was issued to allow use of appellant's property as a landfill. The landfill closed on October 8, 1996, and discontinued its business of accepting and disposing of solid waste. Discontinuing the use of the property as a landfill for over six-months, forfeited the conditional use permit. Therefore, the closed landfill operated as a legal, nonconforming use. The appellate court found that: (1) the district court did not err in refusing to admit documents into evidence or in refusing to take judicial notice of evidence not before the appellee board, (2) the district court did not err in denying appellant's motion for summary judgment as an attempt to add evidence to the record, (3) the appellee's decision was supported by substantial evidence and was otherwise valid, (4) appellant was unable to show detrimental reliance, and (5) appellant failed to meet its burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that appellee board acted illegally or in an arbitrary manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Kansas Department of Revenue argued that appellant's allegation that the implied consent advisories were unconstitutionally vague, was improperly raised for the first time on appeal. The appellate court held that because appellant's vagueness argument challenged the due process afforded to appellant, the court could properly consider the constitutional arguments. The appellate court concluded that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1567a (Supp. 2000) and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1001(f)(1)(G) (Supp. 2000) were not in conflict. The court found that although, arguably, the penalties associated with the different administrative offenses appeared to be incongruous in that a person under the age of 21 seemingly could have received a suspension of less than one year for operating a vehicle with a breath or blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 percent, while a person under the age of 21 who operated a vehicle with a breath or blood alcohol concentration of between .02 and .08 percent faced a mandatory suspension of one year, appellant was not prejudiced by any incongruities within the statutes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and another person forced their way into the victim's house claiming that the victim owed them money for drugs. Appellant drove the victim to his parents' house twice, to get money and guns, keeping the victim at gunpoint. Appellant then cut the victim's face and chest with a steak knife. Drove the victim to a motel and kept him bound with duct tape. At the time of appellant's arrest he had the keys to the car, and a search of the vehicle revealed weapons and drugs. The appellate court found that: (1) the State's cross-examination violated appellant's right to remain silent, but the error was not prejudicial, (2) a unanimity instruction was not required because there were no multiple acts relied upon for the battery conviction, (3) the charges of aggravated battery and aggravated kidnapping were not duplicitous or multiplicitous, (4) there was sufficient circumstantial evidence of possession of cocaine with intent to sell, and (5) the trial court's failure to follow the allocution statute was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who pled guilty to two counts of vehicular burglary and one count of felony theft, appealed sentences imposed by the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) following a remand by the instant court to determine whether defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel regarding the inclusion of three prior misdemeanor battery convictions in his criminal history.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his sentencing counsel's performance was deficient in allowing the three prior battery convictions to be aggregated as one person felony without investigating their validity for enhancement purposes. The trial court refused to hear testimony on whether defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel regarding the inclusion of the three prior convictions in his criminal history; as a result, the instant court indicated that it was unable to determine from the limited record if defendant's sentencing counsel performed in a deficient manner. The instant court held that before defendant's misdemeanor convictions could be counted for enhancement, the record had to show or the State had to prove that defendant was represented by counsel or that he waived counsel. The record for one of defendant's prior convictions did not affirmatively show that he knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel; if, on remand, the trial court were to determine that defendant's sentencing counsel's performance was deficient, the prior conviction in question was unconstitutional and could not be used in defendant's criminal history.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and case was remanded with directions to determine whether defendant's sentencing counsel's performance was deficient. If the trial court were to determine that sentencing counsel's performance was deficient, it would have to vacate defendant's sentence and impose a new sentence consistent with the instant court's opinion. The instant court directed the remand be made to a different judge.</SPAN></P>

Appellee district magistrate judge issued the arrest warrant. Appellant objected because appellee was not a lawyer; thus, he was unqualified to be a judge of the district court under Kan. Const. art. 3, &sect; 7. Appellant also filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus and quo warranto. Appellee was granted summary judgment and appellant's objections were overruled because the constitution did not prohibit statutory provisions granting district magistrate judges authority to handle initial proceedings in criminal cases. The appellate court agreed. Under the constitution, district court judges who exercised general jurisdiction were required to be authorized to practice law. However, district magistrate judges, like appellee, did not have general jurisdiction. Thus, under the constitution, appellee was not required to be licensed to practice law and, the statute was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated robbery, a class B felony, occurring on January 28, 1985. He was sentenced to a prison term of 10 to 20 years which was to run consecutive to a sentence from Shawnee County. The sentence was later modified to show the sentence was to run consecutive to a sentence from Douglas County. He was granted parole on June 15, 1992. Appellant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1507, which was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. Under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4724(b)(2) (Supp. 1993), parolees who had their parole revoked could have their pre-Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act (KSGA) sentences converted under limited retroactive provisions. Notwithstanding appellant's contentions, the limited retroactive provision did not violate equal protection or due process concerns.

The court of appeals affirmed, holding that (1) the trial court's refusal to rely upon the birth mother's interpretation of the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; clause in the consent agreement to establish the existence of a visitation agreement was reasonable, and any misunderstanding did not constitute fraud, misunderstanding, or duress; (2) it was not unreasonable for the attorney, under the circumstances of the case, to fail to inform appellant about community programs designed to assist unwed mothers; and (3) Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with driving while a habitual violator, no proof of liability insurance, and driving without an assigned tag. Appellant contended that he was intending to fix the car, which did not run, by pushing it approximately one third of a mile to his house. The jury found appellant guilty. On appeal, the appellant contended that the State did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was &quot;operating a motor vehicle&quot; under any of the statutes he allegedly violated. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that it was not necessary for a motor vehicle to be operable in order for an individual to drive it for purposes of violating the driving while a habitual offender statute. Second, the jury instructions on the habitual violator statute, while misstating the law, were not clearly erroneous because no real possibility existed that the jury would have rendered a different verdict had the error not occurred. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's Batson challenge to the removal of a black juror.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convictions affirmed. The facts presented established that appellant was in actual physical control of the vehicle, and as a result, he was driving it rather than merely attempting to do so. It was not necessary for the vehicle to be operable to find a violation of the habitual offender statute. Appellant's Batson challenge was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for driving without a license tag. At the time of his arrest, the police officer smelled alcohol on defendant's breath and noticed that his eyes were bloodshot and watery. There were nine beers in a 12-pack box in the truck, and defendant had to lean on the truck to maintain his balance. A preliminary breath test (PBT) indicated that the breath sample was over the legal limit, and defendant failed three field sobriety tests. Defendant appealed contending that the statute that allowed a law enforcement officer to make an arrest based solely on the results of a PBT was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers doctrine, and that there was no probable cause to arrest him. The appellate court found that the portion of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1012 (Supp. 2000), that allowed an officer to make an arrest based solely or in part upon the results of a PBT did not constitute a significant interference by the legislature with the function of judiciary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant submitted various complaints to appellee concerning alleged Kansas Campaign Finance Act (CFA), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25-4142 et seq., violations. Appellant determined insufficient evidence supported appellant's allegations. Appellant sought judicial review in the Shawnee County District Court (Kansas). The district court granted appellee's motion to dismiss, resulting in the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued the district court erred in finding he did not have standing to seek review of appellee's decision and in sealing the record on appeal. He also argued appellee's decision, as affirmed by the district court, impermissibly infringed on his constitutional rights of speech, equal protection, and association. The appeals court affirmed in part, but reversed with respect to the standing issue. The district court erroneously concluded that appellant was not an &quot;aggrieved person&quot; under the CFA. However, appellant's complaint with appellee alleged multiple CFA violations during appellant's own legislative candidacy. He was, therefore, an &quot;aggrieved party&quot; under the simplest use of the phrase. Because he was an aggrieved party, he was entitled to an appeal under the plain terms of the Act for Judicial Review and Civil Enforcement of Agency Actions (KJRA), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-601 et seq. Because appellant had an appeal under the KJRA, it was not necessary for the court to address his alleged constitutional violations. Finally, the CFA's confidentiality provisions required the district court to seal the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part. Contrary to the district court's ruling, appellant was an aggrieved party under the CFA and therefore had a statutory right to appeal under the KJRA. The case was therefore remanded for proceedings pursuant to the KJRA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with robbery and obstruction of official duty after he invited himself into the passenger side of the front seat of the victim's car, forced her to flee from the vehicle and drove off, leading police on a chase prior to his apprehension. He was convicted and appealed, arguing he was entitled to a lesser-included instruction on criminal deprivation of property, that the trial court's instruction regarding obstruction was erroneous, and the prosecutor posed an unconstitutional comment on his post-Miranda silence. The court held appellant was not entitled to the lesser-included offense of criminal deprivation because the crimes of robbery and theft, both crimes against property, were incongruent on the facts because robbery included a crime against the person and appellant's conduct involved such an act. The court dismissed appellant's second argument, as he waived the error for failure to object in the trial court. The court went on to affirm, holding the prosecutor's remark on appellant's post-arrest silence was brief and superficial and the prejudicial effect, if any, was minimal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed, because there could not have been a robbery without a larceny; therefore, the trial court did not err in giving an instruction on criminal deprivation. Further, appellant waived his second argument in the trial court and the prosecutor's comments on appellant's post-arrest silence were harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus as a result of a parole board decision passing him for two and a half years. The petition was voluntarily dismissed by appellant's counsel, apparently without appellant's consultation, and appellant filed a motion to reinstate on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court denied the request. The trial court's found that appellant filed his writ outside the 30-day statutory time limit of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1501(b) (Supp. 1999), and that the trial court was without jurisdiction to hear the matter. The court affirmed. From the record, the court was unable to determine whether appellant's petition was filed outside the 30-day period of the statute, therefore the trial court erred in basing its decision on the 30-day rule. Although the trial court erred in its finding, the court's upheld the ruling for a different reason. The court held that appellant's claim of ineffective assistance was without merit. There was no constitutional right to counsel in a post-conviction proceeding. Therefore, without right to counsel, appellant could not make a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The trial court erred in basing its denial of appellant's request to reinstate his petition for writ of habeas corpus on the 30-day filing period because the record did not show whether the petition was filed outside the time limit. However, the court affirmed because there was no constitutional right to counsel in a post-conviction proceeding, appellant could not claim ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court reversed the decision and remanded the case for calculation of benefits based on two scheduled injuries. Reasoning that the rule in an old case was an exception to the general rule in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-510d (1999 Supp.), appellee's injuries were not sustained to parallel limbs and did not create as serious of an impairment as if it was. The court was duty bound to follow precedent. The evidence established that appellee's injuries did not create or even come close to a permanent total disability. That disability requires an injury which renders the employee completely and permanently incapable of engaging in any type of substantial and gainful employment, and this was not one of those cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Reversed and remanded. Injuries were not sustained to parallel limbs and did not create serious impairments, thus the rule that compensation should be determined under the permanent total disability statute and the unscheduled permanent partial disability provision did not apply in this case, and was an exception to Kan.

After a jury trial, appellant was convicted of kidnapping, aggravated burglary, and two counts of aggravated assault in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 21-3420, 21-3716, 21-3410. Appellant moved for a new trial based on the fact that a juror stated that his guilty verdict was coerced. The motion was denied. Appellant sought review, contending that the evidence was insufficient to support the kidnapping conviction, and that he was denied a fair trial because of judicial comments and jury misconduct. Judgment was affirmed because the evidence of kidnapping by means of threat was overwhelming and it was harmless error for the court to include deception as an alternate means in the jury instructions; the judicial comments did not violate any of appellant's trial rights, and appellant failed to prove juror misconduct.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the money should be forfeited to appellee city under the Kansas Asset Seizure and Forfeiture Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-4101 et seq. On appeal, the court affirmed. Substantial competent evidence supported the finding concerning the forfeitability of the money. Appellee met its burden of proof by showing that the money was in close proximity to the contraband, and appellant failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the money was not subject to forfeiture. Appellant's constitutional challenge to the act was without merit and that the forfeiture was not grossly disproportionate to appellant's conduct in possessing illegal substances.

The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that because defendant failed to object to the introduction of the drug evidence at trial, his challenge to the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress was not properly preserved on appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following suspension of his driving license for 30 days for failing an alcohol breath test, appellant's license was restricted by the Kansas Department of Revenue (KDR) for an additional 330 days. On appeal to the district court, appellant asked the court to allow him to drive to and from his residence to his former wife's residence to exercise visitation privileges with his minor children. The district court concluded it lacked jurisdiction to alter the restrictions. Appellant challenged that decision, arguing the lower court erred in concluding it lacked jurisdiction. Appellant also raised two other issues on appeal that he did not raise in front of the district court. The court found appellant waived the last two issues for failure to raise them. The court also found the district court properly determined it lacked jurisdiction. The court found the clear language of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1015 (1999 Supp.) stated that only KDR could place restrictions on appellant's license. Because there were no statutes granting the court jurisdiction to alter restrictions, the court lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court held the statute applied retroactively to defendant's case. The court found the statute merely altered the procedural aspects of the trial, and therefore did not violate the constitutional ex post facto law prohibition. Defendant did not object to the failure to give the disputed jury instruction at trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant sought reversal of the securities fraud conviction and sentence imposed on him by the Sedgwick (Kansas) District Court, presenting five different grounds for relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant, convicted of various securities violations after bench trial, sought appellate relief on five grounds. State appellate court denied relief, opining that (a) coerced jury waiver claim meritless, as nothing in record indicated coercion; (b) jurisdictional claim meritless, as state could prosecute appellant due to his failure to register as a commodity pool operator with Commodities Futures Trading Commission; (c) improper multiple alternative allegations claim meritless, as there was sufficient evidence to convict him failing to inform customers of his earlier securities law convictions, and it is presumed that trial judge knew of elements of each crime; (d) improper venue claim meritless, since when multiple acts required for crime occur in different counties, venue is proper in either county; and (e) erroneous criminal history score claim meritless, as appellant's score would be the same even if conviction allegedly erroneously included in score were excluded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction affirmed, as record belied coerced jury waiver claim, state had jurisdiction given failure to register as commodity pool operator, evidence sufficient to convict on sentenced crime, and venue proper since part of crime occurred in county; sentence affirmed since excluding challenged prior conviction would not alter criminal history score.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to having sexual intercourse with a minor and alleged that his plea was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and that a presumptive sentence was improperly imposed without consideration of an unaccepted plea bargain offer. The court held that, although defendant timely requested new appointed counsel, the trial court adequately inquired into the request and defendant's disagreement with counsel over defense strategies did not constitute a lack of communication justifying withdrawal and substitution of counsel. While counsel did not advise defendant of the possibility of requesting a continuance based on changed expert testimony, such conduct was not unreasonable where the totality of the evidence indicated that a continuance would have made no difference and that it was not likely defendant would have otherwise insisted on trial. Also, defendant was statutorily barred from challenging his sentence other than by collateral attack on motion to the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Orders were affirmed; defendant's strategy disagreement with counsel did not warrant appointment of new counsel, counsel's failure to advise defendant of the possibility of continuance would not have affected the outcome or defendant's decision to plead guilty, and review of defendant's sentence was statutorily limited to a collateral motion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion in limine. Three of the counts were never refiled after being dismissed. The State did not comply with Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an Ellis District Court (Kansas) decision suspending her license, for driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, whose driver's license had been suspended for driving while intoxicated, contended that the trial court erred in finding that the officer had probable cause to believe she was operating her vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, that the court did not have jurisdiction because, without probable cause, the preliminary breath test (PBT) was an unconstitutional search and seizure, and that the court erred by admitting into evidence the results of her PBT without laying a proper foundation. The court affirmed the trial court's decision, finding that the officer had probable cause, which was synonymous with the statutory term &quot;reasonable grounds,&quot; that the trial court correctly determined that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1012 did not require a finding of probable cause before administering a preliminary breath test, and that as no objection was made earlier, a claim of error could not be made regarding evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decision, stating that appellant's arrest was based on probable cause, which was synonymous with the statutory term &quot;reasonable grounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
