According to the plain terms of the ordinance, when the manufacturer transferred the fuel from its large holding tanks into the individual tanks of new vehicles rolling off its assembly line, it was making &quot;use&quot; of the fuel, regardless of where or when the fuel was ultimately burned to operate the new vehicles, or where or when the vehicles were delivered or sold to a dealership; [2]-None of the claimed exemptions was applicable to the manufacturer's use of the fuel; [3]-The manufacturer could not prove that enforcement of the tax ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 11, because respondent was sentenced as a juvenile under the Act to commitment until the age of 21 years, a sentence that was not equivalent to being sentenced as an adult to death or to life without parole. He was only sentenced as a habitual juvenile offender to a mandatory commitment after he had committed two offenses that would have constituted a felony if he had been prosecuted as an adult, and a violent third offense that was specifically delineated by the legislature in the Act; [2]-The habitual juvenile offender provision of the Act did not violate the principles of constitutional due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appeal No. 2-13-0825, the court affirmed the decisions of the circuit court and the Commissioner. In appeal No. 2-13-0978, the court reversed the decisions of the circuit court and the decisions of the Commissioner on the first and second remands. In lieu of remanding to the circuit court, the court denied one of the party's original petition for writ of certiorari and reinstated the Commissioner's original decision to revoke its license.</SPAN></P>

Const. 1970, art. I, &sect; 11 because AUUW contained an additional element that defendant's firearm be uncased, immediately accessible, and loaded that the UPWF did not require; [3]-The circuit erred by imposing more than one document storage fee, automation fee, circuit clerk fee, and security fee under the Clerks of Courts Act.</SPAN></P>

The boat was stopped pursuant to 625 ILCS 45/2-2(a) (2010) and the officers asked to see defendant's safety equipment and registration. The officers did not search the boat and the record suggested that the length of the stop was not great. Not only did the evidence demonstrate that the boat patrol operation was regular and systematic, but it also indicated that the official nature of the operation was apparent.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 13 only attached to actions where the right existed under the English common law when the 1970 Illinois Constitution was adopted; [2]-Section 143.24d was unconstitutional as it eliminated the right to trial by jury in actions to which that right had  historically attached; even there was some doubt as to whether there was right to jury trial for an insurer's subrogation/negligence claim the maxim that statutes regulating the right to jury trial were to be liberally construed in favor of the right and the inclination of the court had to be to protect and enforce the right had to be applied.</SPAN></P>

Sup. Ct. R. 615(b)(2); [3]-The FOID card requirement of &sect; 24-1.6(a)(3)(C) was not unconstitutional because the public carriage of handguns by those under 21 was not core conduct subject to Second Amendment protection.</SPAN></P>

Neither officer had reason to believe that defendant was armed or dangerous. Because defendant was standing unsecured only two or three feet away from the purse, the appellate court failed to understand how her repeated actions of grabbing for the purse could have been entirely unsuccessful and, at the same time, perceived as consistent with the actions of a person trying to obtain a weapon to use against the officers or others.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-The UUWF statute did not violate the Second Amendment's right to bear arms either facially or as applied to defendant. It would be a strange world indeed for the law to be constitutionally sound in preventing and prohibiting convicted felons from having firearms, but allowing them to keep the very thing that made firearms deadly; [2]-Felon-based firearm bans, including firearm ammunition, like the UUWF statute, did not impose a burden on conduct falling within the scope of the Second Amendment.</SPAN></P>

(2010) was not unconstitutionally vague because appellant was on notice that videotaping and GPS surveillance of appellee were within the conduct the Act sought to prohibit, and by planting a tracking device on appellee's car and training a hidden video on her desk would cause a reasonable person to have some fear for his or her safety; [2]-The Act did not violate appellant's equal protection rights because it did not treat labor picketing more favorably than any other form of protected speech or associational conduct; [3]-The Act did not violate appellant's right to freedom of speech because it narrowly restricted only the act of stalking and did not seek to regulate speech; [4] The trial court's finding that appellant's actions were covered by the Act was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit, Peoria County, Illinois, convicted defendant of armed robbery, 720 ILCS 5/18-2(a)(2) (2008), and attempted armed robbery, 720 ILCS 5/8-4(a), 18-2(a)(2) (2008), for which he was sentenced to concurrent terms of 21 and 10 years of imprisonment, respectively. Defendant's motion to reconsider was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his conviction for armed robbery should be reversed because the 2009 indictment charged him with a category of armed robbery that had been abolished in 2000 and therefore was void. The appellate court found that from the language of the statute, it was clear that the State intended to prosecute defendant for a violation of 720 ILCS 5/18-2(a)(2). Therefore, the indictment was not void in that defendant was charged with armed robbery with a firearm in violation of section 18-2(a)(2). There was no uncertainty that defendant was being charged pursuant to section 18-2(a)(2) in that the robbery was alleged to have involved a firearm. The indictment apprised defendant of the precise offense charged with enough specificity so that he could prepare his defense, and the language of the indictment did not prejudice defendant. The mittimus was modified to reflect the vacatur of the requirement that defendant submit a DNA sample and pay the $200 DNA analysis assessment, which was nos subject to offset by 725 ILCS 5/110-14 (2008). The trial court did not err in imposing a 15-year enhancement on defendant's armed robbery conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioner challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, finding the surviving spouse benefit of the pension plan of respondent former husband was not marital property subject to distribution, in the action with intervenor teacher pension fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner and husband were married in 1980 and divorced in 2005. Prior to the divorce, the husband moved to the United Kingdom, taking their child. The judgment of dissolution awarded the entire marital portion of the pension to the petitioner. The petitioner argued that upon the passing of the husband she was entitled to the surviving spouse benefit despite not meeting the statutory definition of a surviving spouse under 40 ILCS 5/17-121(a) (2004). The appellate court ruled that the trial court properly denied the petition to distribute the survivor benefit as marital property. The statute awarding the pension restricted receipt of the benefit only to a surviving spouse. The survivor benefits belonged to neither the petitioner nor the husband. As the contingent benefits belonged to neither spouse, they could not be considered marital property under the Marriage Act, which required the property to be acquired by either spouse subsequent to the marriage under 750 ILCS 5/503(a) (2004). Also, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the petitioner's request for a mandatory injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence of 80 years' imprisonment. The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant was unable to point to anything in the record that suggested that the trial court failed to consider any of the mitigating factors he presented. The trial court conducted lengthy proceedings in which it considered numerous factors in aggravation and mitigation. The trial court heard testimony from multiple witnesses who explained the immense emotional grief the victim's family suffered and continued to suffer as a result of his death. Additionally, the trial court provided a very detailed explanation of its reasoning, highlighting each aggravating and mitigating factor. The evidence in the case showed that defendant fired gunshots into a vehicle containing four unsuspecting passengers, taking the life of one innocent passenger. Defendant was not aware of the identities of any of the passengers, yet he fired into the vehicle with the intent to harm. The crime resulted not only in the loss of the victim's life, but also impacted the lives of all his family members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, directed plaintiff administrator to pay $206,914.29 to intervenor employer in satisfaction of the decedent's employer's workers' compensation lien against damages recovered by the administrator in an underlying tort action. The order denied the employer's request for a portion of the interest on the underlying judgment amount. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that the administrator had not forfeited review of this argument on appeal. Based on 820 ILCS 305/5(b) (1994) of the Workers' Compensation Act (WCA) and the principles of a prior case, the employer was not entitled to reimbursement of its workers' compensation payments to the administrator until she, as personal representative of the estate of her husband, had obtained a judgment against the third-party tortfeasors in the underlying action and had been paid by the tortfeasors' insurer. The employer had no legal right to a portion of the interest awarded to the administrator that accrued between the date of judgment in 2006 and the date the judgment was satisfied in 2012. Nowhere in the WCA did it allow an employer to recover interest on the portion of the judgment that had nothing to do with the workers' compensation lien, but which was obtained in favor of an employee's personal representative. The WCA made no provision for an employer to recover interest payments on either the lien amount or the portion of the judgment that exceeded the workers' compensation lien.</SPAN></P>

Evid. 702 concerning the State's diagnosis of paraphilia not otherwise specified sexually attracted to adolescent males, also known as hebephilia, because respondent raised serious questions regarding the validity and unorthodoxy of the diagnosis, and the State did nothing to show that the diagnosis was generally accepted as a mental disorder. The court rejected respondent's argument that the trial court erred by permitting the State to elicit testimony and argue for involuntary commitment based on mental disorders not pleaded in its petition because respondent failed to show that he was prejudiced from any variance between the State's pleadings and proof, as his expert rebutted the State's diagnosis of substance abuse disorders and mitigated the antisocial personality disorder diagnosis. Respondent failed to comply with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 341(h)(7), and therefore the court did not address his claim, because he provided no framework, cited no law, and offered little guidance as to why the trial court's treatment of SVP Act cases violated the due process or equal protection clauses.</SPAN></P>

The Board found that the candidate filed 522 signatures. After some signatures were invalidated, the Board found that the candidate did not have the minimum number of signatures required and his nomination papers were invalid in their entirety. The appellate court ruled that the Board did not err in refusing to consider signatures after the maximum of 410 had been reached, as the Board's rule constituted a rational means of enforcing the statutory maximum imposed under 10 ILCS 5/10-3 (2010). Also, the Board correctly invalidated the 56 signatures contained on petitions circulated by the candidate where he previously circulated petitions for a political party in the same election cycle. The only possible interpretation of 10 ILCS 5/10-4 (2010) that did not render the prohibition a nullity was to conclude that it applied to a given election cycle, whether it be a consolidated or a general election cycle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's treating physician placed him on light-duty work restrictions because of a back injury at work. His condition worsened after he performed tasks outside his restrictions, and he left his employment. Conflicting evidence was presented as to whether he resigned or was terminated, whether the employer had required him to work beyond his restrictions, and whether he had been denied physical therapy or had failed to schedule it. The court held that sufficient evidence supported the jury's conclusion that he had been terminated and that the employer had not offered him another position. His failure to disclose the cause of action as a bankruptcy asset did not give rise to judicial estoppel. Jury instructions on causation and on workers' compensation law were correct. The workers' compensation claim file qualified as a business record under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 236(a), and the hearsay within hearsay rule, Ill. R. Evid. 805, applied to statements by employees and agents, which were party admissions. The attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine did not exclude the claim file. The employer's conduct warranted punitive damages, and the amounts awarded were not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nurse argued that the circuit court erred in denying her request for a preliminary injunction. The nurse argued that the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation Law (Act), 20 ILCS 2105/2105-165 (2012), could not be applied retroactively. The appellate court had rejected similar claims that the Act violated the proscription against ex post facto laws, the constitutional protection against double jeopardy, and the right to procedural due process. The Act was neither retroactive nor punitive in its nature and application. The legislature intended to deny health care licenses to anyone with a conviction described in the Act, including one which required sex offender registry. This statute was rationally related to the public interest in that it sought to protect the public from potentially dangerous health care workers and to maintain the integrity of the health care professions. The government had a strong interest in regulating health care workers and protecting the public from those health care workers with convictions triggered by the Act. The classification that the Act created did not violate U.S. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1 or Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police executed a search warrant at a particular location.

Following a bench trial, defendant was found guilty of one count of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon in violation of 720 ILCS 5/24-1.6 (2010). On appeal, at issue was whether the State proved all of the elements of the offense of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court found that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly possessed the gun that was attributed to him. It noted that the State presented three witnesses, none of whom saw a gun in defendant's hands or noticed him make any actions that would indicate that defendant was discarding a gun. It also found that no physical evidence linked defendant to the gun. It then added that the &quot;mere presence&quot; of a weapon was not sufficient to prove that he had knowledge of the weapon and that the State had not shown that defendant exercised exclusive or immediate control over the area where the weapon was found.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied his successive petition for postconviction relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 ILCS 5/122-1 et seq. (2010).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder, one count of aggravated vehicular hijacking, one count of aggravated criminal sexual assault, and one count of armed robbery. He filed a petition for postconviction relief, asserting a claim of actual innocence based on new DNA testing performed on several pieces of evidence. The trial court denied the petition. On appeal, the court found that the trial court's finding that defendant did not make a showing of actual innocence substantial enough to warrant a new trial was not manifestly erroneous. The new DNA evidence did not exonerate him because it did not show that he did not commit the crimes. The new DNA evidence, at best, only established that the DNA of the rape victim's husband was found on a vaginal swab and a sanitary napkin and that defendant could be excluded as a possible contributor of DNA on the vaginal swab and sanitary napkin. The State presented a plausible explanation for the presence of the husband's DNA on the swab and the sanitary napkin that defendant did not refute. Further, defendant made no argument that postconviction counsel failed in the duties imposed upon him under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651(c).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a petition for relief from judgment under 735 ILCS 5/2-1401 (2010) in which he asserted his second conviction for murder and life sentence were void. The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, granted the State's motion to dismiss. Appellant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's second conviction for murder became final in 2000, when he was sentenced pursuant to 730 ILCS 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(i) (1992). Therefore, his petition for relief from judgment filed under 735 ILCS 5/2-1401 ten years later was barred by the two-year statutory limitation. Appellant reasoned that his life sentence was void and could be challenged at any time. In Miller v. Alabama, the United States Supreme Court held that mandatory life without parole for those under the age of 18 violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. However, Miller did not affect the validity of life imprisonment for nonminor defendants, so 730 ILCS 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(i) was not unconstitutional on its face. Appellant failed to show that a constitutional violation deprived the trial court of its jurisdiction over the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court, Illinois, granted defendants', the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (Department) and Director, motions to dismiss plaintiff doctors's actions seeking a declaration that the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation Law (Act), 20 ILCS 2105/2105-165 (2012), could be applied only prospectively and injunctive relief enjoining the Department from revoking licenses. The doctors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctors argued that the Act did not reflect an intent that it apply to health care workers convicted of a triggering event prior to its enactment. The appellate court found that the Act clearly applied to the doctors' convictions, even though they predated the Act. The Act affected only the doctors' rights to practice as health care workers subsequent to its enactment. Their licenses were revoked pursuant to the Act, and the Act did not adopt any provision of the Medical Practice Act, 225 ILCS 60/22 (2010). The doctors' due process challenges were rejected, as well as their argument that they were entitled to a hearing by statute. The Act was non-punitive in nature, its clear intent being the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the public; and that it was not intended as additional punishment for the doctors' past criminal acts. The Act did not violate separation-of-powers principles, Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, and did not violate the contracts clause, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. Because the Act was not punitive, it could not constitute a disproportionate penalty. The legislature intended that no limitation apply to license revocations pursuant to the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, denied the motion to reconsider an order denying the motion to quash service filed by defendant public guardian, as the limited guardian of the estate of the ward, a mentally disabled individual, in the proceeding with plaintiff estate special administrator. A certified question was presented for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court was asked to address the following certified question from the trial court: whether service by publication pursuant to and upheld by the trial court's orders under 735 ILCS 5/2-203.1 (2010) satisfied due process? The appellate court ruled that the guardian had standing to file an application for leave to appeal. The appellate court answered the certified question in the negative and held that service by publication in the instant case did not satisfy due process. The reason for the adjudication of disability was because the ward was incapable of managing his affairs. Under these circumstances even if the ward had seen the published notice, he likely would not have understood what it meant. The appellate court acknowledged the difficulties the administrator experienced in attempting to locate the ward, however, those difficulties did not change the fact that service by publication could not be reasonably calculated to apprise an individual in the ward's circumstances, of the legal ramifications of a lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified question was answered in the negative and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) convicting him of two counts of violating the Harassing or Obscene Communications Act, 720 ILCS 135/1-2(a)(1), (a)(2) (2008), and one count of unlawful use of encryption, former 720 ILCS 5/16D-5.5(b)(1) (2008) (720 ILCS 5/17-52.5 (2010)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's contention that 720 ILCS 135/1-2 was unconstitutional under the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, was rejected because there was no content-based discrimination. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because: (1) the victim testified that after she noticed the changes on her social media web page she called defendant who laughed at her and told her she deserved it; (2) the victim testified she and defendant had broken up and were not on good terms at the time her web page was altered; (3) defendant had taken the photo of the victim on his cell phone; (4) the victim testified that defendant helped her create the web page, that only she and defendant knew the password, and that she did not make the changes at issue; and (5) the victim's web page had been accessed by a computer from defendant's home address. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction of unlawful use of encryption because defendant's changing the password of the victim's social media account web page did not alter a file or prevent law enforcement from tracking down defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions of harassment through electronic communications were affirmed but his conviction of unlawful use of encryption was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed. Defendant properly obtained leave to file the instant successive postconviction petition. Two affidavits were newly discovered evidence. Transcripts of one witness's testimony at a co-defendant's postconviction proceedings revealed that the first time the witness ever told anyone about his involvement in the arson for which defendant was convicted, was during a Bible study meeting. The testimony also revealed that he confessed to the arson several years after defendant's second trial. Defendant averred that he did not know the witness and never had any contact with him in prison. Thus, no amount of due diligence on defendant's part could have resulted in the discovery of the confession. In the other affidavit, the second witness attested that his trial testimony was a lie and that police officers threatened him to obtain the testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon (AUUW) in violation of 720 ILCS 5/24-1.6(a)(1), (2), (3)(A) (2010), and one count of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon in violation of 720 ILCS 5/24-1.1(a) (2010).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for AUUW and unlawful use of a weapon by a felon, but the appellate court affirmed. Defendant's actions were consistent with the situation he was in, which was being pursued by law enforcement, and hardly improbable. A criminal opting to dispose of contraband after becoming aware of police presence was not only believable, but also common. Additionally, the right to self-defense did not encompass a right to carry a loaded, readily accessible firearm in public areas. Moreover, defendant's U.S. Const. amend. II challenge additionally suffered because of his status as a felon. Case law did not suggest that the U.S. Const. amend. II right to keep and bear arms guaranteed a felon's ability to own and possess a firearm.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that because the Miller decision, which rendered mandatory life sentences for minors unconstitutional, applied retroactively to defendant's case and because he was sentenced to a mandatory term of natural life without parole under 730 ILCS 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(i) (2010) when he was 17 years old, his sentence was invalid under Miller and therefore it was vacated. The court further held that the trial court erred by dismissing defendant's postconviction petition in the first stage of its review because whether the State had knowledge sufficient to allow it to initiate the murder prosecution at the same time it was prosecuting defendant for gun possession and solicitation to commit aggravated discharge of a firearm under 720 ILCS 5/3-3 (2006) required a factual determination, which was not permitted during the first stage of postconviction review.</SPAN></P>

According to defendant, the statute improperly merges the inchoate offense of attempted prostitution with the completed offense of prostitution. The court rejected defendant's argument, concluding that her interpretation of the prostitution statute was faulty. Defendant's argument improperly assumed the offense of prostitution is only &quot;completed&quot; when a defendant actually performs an act of sexual penetration, thereby equating prostitution with a sexual act. The offense of prostitution is comprised of three types of prohibited conduct, one of which is an agreement to perform an act of sexual penetration for money.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient sued defendants, a podiatrist, medical schools, professional associations, and the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation (IDPR), in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) for tort and statutory claims, including medical battery, arising out of surgery performed by the podiatrist. The trial court granted the physician summary judgment on the medical battery claim and dismissed all other claims. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient said the podiatrist severed his tendons against his directions. The appellate court held his medical battery and medical negligence claims failed because he (1) knowingly consented to the surgery and (2) presented no expert opinion required by former 735 ILCS 5/2-622 (1998), since a layperson could not find if the surgery exceeded his consent. His 735 ILCS 5/13-215 (2004) fraudulent concealment claim was properly dismissed because no claim as to which it could extend a limitations period survived. No fraudulent misrepresentation was pled because no (1) concealment of a material fact, (2) intent to induce a false belief, or (3) inability to discover the truth were alleged. Illinois Antitrust Act, 740 ILCS 10/1 et seq. (2004), claims against professional associations for podiatrists' refusal to provide a supporting opinion were properly dismissed because no alleged facts showed a conspiracy. His mandamus claim against the IDPR for not disciplining the podiatrist was properly dismissed because he could not compel the IDPR to exercise its discretion. It was no error to deny leave to amend his complaint to claim punitive damages because underlying claims failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The McHenry County Circuit Court (Illinois), on remand of the case to it from the appellate court, determined that a demolition order could be reissued after the appellate court had found that plaintiff village's first demolition action was invalid because it had not provided 65 ILCS 5/11-31-1(a) (2006) notice of the action to a lienholder. Defendant apartment building owner, whose building was the subject of the demolition action, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fire damaged an apartment building. The village attempted to remediate what it considered to be a public hazard by obtaining court approval to demolish that building. Although the trial court granted the necessary approval, the appellate vacated the demolition order because the record indicated that the property had a lien on it and the village had not provided the lienholder with the required 65 ILCS 5/11-31-1(a) (2006) notice of the village's intent to seek the demolition order. On remand, the village issued a notice to the lienholder, a bank. Over the owner's objection that the notice was deficient, the trial court reissued the demolition order. The appellate court found that the trial court complied with the appellate court's direction on remand to make sure the lienholder was notified of the demolition proceeding and, thus, it could reissue the demolition order without allowing the owner to present fresh evidence of the condition of the building.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 9th Judicial Circuit, Fulton County (Illinois), entered final judgments of conviction after it found defendant guilty of two counts of aggravated reckless driving in violation of 625 ILCS 5/11-503(a)(1) (2010). Defendant appealed her conviction and resulting 24-month prison sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a stipulated bench trial at which evidence was presented that defendant drove over 100 miles per hour and without knowing what dangers or defects were in the road ahead, she was convicted of two counts of aggravated reckless driving in violation of 625 ILCS 5/11-503(a)(1) (2010). Such charges had been filed after defendant, 16-years-old at the time, lost control of the vehicle and it crashed into a utility pole, killing two of her three passengers. She was sentenced to 24 months in prison. On appeal, she argued that: (1) the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the matter or transfer it to the juvenile court; (2) the concurrent jurisdiction statute violated the federal and state constitutions; (3) the trial court erred in convicting her of aggravated reckless driving; and (4) her sentence was an abuse of discretion. The appellate court found that she could be tried as an adult because the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 expressed a preference for some times holding a juvenile to an adult level of accountability; the concurrent jurisdiction statute was constitutional; the evidence supported her conviction; and her sentencing was within the appropriate sentencing range.</SPAN></P>

The dentist moved to dismiss the complaint. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice. The trial court denied the patient's motion to reconsider.

The trial court could have granted the patient additional time to file the attorney affidavit. The trial court was incorrect when it found that it was without discretion to grant the patient additional time to file the attorney affidavit.

While those charges were pending, the State instituted a civil commitment proceeding. The trial court declared him a sexually dangerous person under 725 ILCS 205/1.01 (2008) and ordered his commitment. On appeal, the court found no error in the trial court's decision to allow the State's experts to testify regarding respondent's past misconduct as it pertained to their evaluations. The two psychiatrists did not testify as to the contents of police reports and other documents to establish the truth of the matter asserted in those reports. Rather, the information, as testified to, was presented for the purpose of explaining the bases for their opinions. The testimony did not violate respondent's constitutional right to confront witnesses against him. Further, certified copies of respondent's prior convictions for criminal sexual abuse were sufficient to prove that he had demonstrated propensities toward acts of sexual assault. The testimony of both well-qualified experts supported the State's claim that it was substantially probable that he would reoffend if he was not confined.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed defendant's appeal without considering the merits of his contention that the DUI conviction entered upon his guilty plea violated double jeopardy protection and was thus a void judgment because defendant did not file a written post plea motion within 30 days of the date of sentencing as required by Ill.

The trial court had jurisdiction to enter the order, even if it implicated double jeopardy protection, and therefore the order was merely voidable, and could not be attacked at any time. While defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on grounds of former jeopardy, he did not appeal the denial of that motion but instead proceeded to plead guilty, implicating Rule 604(d).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought suit under &sect; 1983 for violation of their constitutional rights. Plaintiffs alleged that the officer, acting under color of state law, became actively involved in a vehicle repossession and violated their constitutional due process rights. The trial court awarded summary judgment to defendants. On appeal, the court found that several facts indicated that the officer affirmatively aided the repossessor and intimidated plaintiffs from exercising their legal right to object to the repossession under 810 ILCS 5/9-609 (2008). The officer was called to the scene by the repossessor, was present throughout the duration of the repossession, ordered one plaintiff to turn the vehicle keys over, threatened to arrest one plaintiff if she interfered with the repossession, and recognized the &quot;repossession order&quot; over plaintiffs' protestations. Whether the officer acted as a peacekeeper or facilitated the repossession by ordering one plaintiff to turn over the vehicle keys and threatening to detain her was at the heart of the controversy and could not be determined on the evidentiary record. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the dismissal of his third and fourth petitions for post-conviction relief entered by the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. The petitions were filed pursuant to the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 ILCS 5/122-1 et seq. (2010).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a third post-conviction petition, claiming actual innocence, and submitted affidavits from his co-defendants, among others, indicating that he was wrongly identified as the fifth perpetrator.  Appellant's fourth post-conviction petition alleged that his sentence was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Appellant had shown a freestanding claim of actual innocence because the evidence regarding appellant's wrongful identification was newly discovered and not before the circuit court; such evidence was material and noncumulative and probably would have changed the result of his trial. Based on the Miller decision handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court, a mandatory life sentence without parole for a juvenile was a violation of cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Appellant, who was 17 at the time of the offenses, demonstrated cause and prejudice under 725 ILCS 5/122-1(f) (2010). The rule applied retroactively as appellant was denied a basic precept of justice as his age was not considered in his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's decision and remanded with directions for the circuit court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the third petition. If the circuit court declined to grant a new trial after that hearing, the circuit court would be required to conduct a new sentencing hearing in accord with the holding on the fourth petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations filed amended tax returns seeking a refund of income tax paid under 35 ILCS 5/304(d)(2) (2010) on its gas pipelines that traversed Illinois, but neither begin or end within Illinois. The Department argued that the flow-through gas miles were properly included in the numerator of the apportionment factor set forth in Section 304(d)(2). The appellate court ruled that the corporations' flow-through miles were properly included in the numerator of the apportionment factor for the tax years. The Department's interpretation of Section 304(d)(2) best accomplished the legislative intent by apportioning the corporations' income tax burden in Illinois and did not create a gap in taxation for the corporations' interstate business. Also, the inclusion of the flow-through miles in the numerator of the apportionment factor pursuant to Section 304(d)(2) was consistent with the commerce clause. The corporations maintained a significant presence in Illinois and enjoyed the benefits that Illinois provided for its property and operations in Illinois.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that pursuant to Teague, Miller v.

Because Miller mandated a sentencing range broader than that provided by 730 ILCS 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii) (2010) for minors convicted of first-degree murder who could otherwise receive only natural life in prison, defendant, who was 17 years old at the time of the murder, was entitled to a new sentencing hearing where natural life imprisonment was not the only available sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of orders from the Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County (Illinois), which granted temporary guardianship of her daughter to appellee grandmother under the Probate Act of 1975, 755 ILCS 5/1-1 et seq. (2010), and subsequently entered another order granting joint guardianship to the grandmother and appellee grandfather.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother titled her petition for temporary guardianship as an emergency petition, alleging that the mother was incapable of caring for the child. The grandparents also filed a separate joint petition for guardianship. The mother did not appear at the hearing on the first petition. The mother testified at the hearing on the second petition, and the trial court found that the mother was unable to care for the child. The trial court made no findings at either hearing as to whether the father was willing and able to provide care, nor did it determine that guardianship would be in the child's best interest. The court held that the trial court erred in granting temporary guardianship under 755 ILCS 5/11-8 (2010) because the Probate Act contained no explicit provisions for an emergency petition for guardianship and because the trial court did not make the threshold determinations required by 755 ILCS 5/11-5(a), (b) (2010) that guardianship was in the child's best interest and that the grandmother had rebutted the presumption that the mother was willing and able to provide care. Because the trial court made no best interest determination, the second order had to be vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the first order of guardianship, vacated the second order, and remanded for a best interest determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Champaign County, Illinois, convicted defendant, pursuant to a guilty plea, of one count of first degree murder. Defendant filed petitions for postconviction review. The Office of the State Appellate Defender (OSAD) moved to withdraw as an appellate counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">OSAD argued defendant's petitions presented no meritorious issues. Defendant's 735 ILCS 5/2-1401 (2010) petition for relief from judgment and postconviction petition both alleged that he was not properly admonished about mandatory supervised release (MSR) at his plea hearing. The appellate court found that the record showed defendant was admonished that any prison term would be followed by three years' MSR before his guilty plea in compliance with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402(a). Defendant's claims he was not admonished about MSR were contradicted by the record and legally without merit. While the best practice may be for the trial court or counsel to expressly link the MSR term to the agreed-upon sentence, failure to make that link did not violate Rule 402 or the parties' plea agreement. The court's sentencing judgment did not breach the plea agreement by imposing MSR as mandatorily required. Defendant's prison term and MSR were a part of the same sentence, not two different sentences. Enactment of MSR did not violate the separation of powers clause of the Illinois Constitution. Defendant's additional claim was not raised in his postconviction petition.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to admonish defendant pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 401(a) and therefore its implicit finding that defendant waived his right to counsel could not stand. Although defendant indicated that he was going to try to hire counsel of his own choice, he never rejected the idea of the trial court's appointing counsel for him, as it had done so previously.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, held certain defendants, majority members of a member-managed limited liability company (LLC), in civil contempt for refusing to comply with the court's order to disclose certain recovery requests to plaintiff minority member. The majority members appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The majority members argued that the trial court's discovery order violated due process by improperly making certain factual findings suggesting that the minority member remained a member of the LLC after October 1, 2007. The appellate court found that the majority members' suggested course of conduct, requiring the minority member to present evidence before he had been permitted to obtain that evidence, was premature. Their due process argument was forfeited. The majority members failed to convince the appellate court that they should not be bound by their verified allegations in the trial court that the minority remained a member of the LLC. As a former member, 805 ILCS 180/10-15(a) (2010) gave him the right to inspect records pertaining to the period of his membership. Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 201 required only that the minority member was seeking disclosure for the purpose of obtaining evidence relevant to this pending litigation. The dual representation doctrine applied because the attorney simultaneously represented the majority members and LLCs, and the minority member had the right to see communications made during the attorney's representation of the LLC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as to the trial court's discovery order and the order holding defendants in contempt was vacated.</SPAN></P>

The evidence showed that the statements regarding defendant's threats to kill the victim were made in response to questions primarily by friends, family members, and coworkers who inquired of the victim for various reasons or were volunteered by the victim to that same audience, undoubtedly for a host of reasons that had nothing to do with ensuring defendant was incarcerated but, instead, everything to do with her concern that defendant might kill her. Her statements did not constitute testimonial hearsay because there was no government involvement in eliciting or receiving them.</SPAN></P>

The trial court erred by ordering counsel to disgorge funds to the wife's attorney for payment of her interim attorney fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, convicted defendant of armed robbery with a firearm under 720 ILCS 5/18-2 and sentenced him to 21 years of imprisonment, which included a 15-year enhancement under 720 ILCS 5/18-2(b) (2008) for using a firearm during the commission of the offense. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the conviction was sufficiently supported by the victim's identification testimony, together with DNA evidence matching defendant to the jacket, hat, gloves, and do-rag found in a nearby dumpster, and by the discovery of lighters inside the jacket pocket as testified to by the victim and depicted in the videotape. Although the perpetrator was wearing a hat pulled down to his eyes, the victim testified that she was able to see his face from the middle of his eyes all the way down. The court also held that although the gun used in the robbery was never recovered and the few seconds of video showing the gun were blurry and did not give much detail, the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant used a &quot;firearm.&quot; The only evidence was the victim's testimony that defendant was armed with a &quot;real&quot; gun, not a toy or BB gun, corroborated by videotape that showed defendant holding what appeared to be an actual gun. Finally, the 15-year sentence enhancement for armed robbery with a firearm under 720 ILCS 5/18-2 did not violate the proportionate penalties clause because armed robbery and armed violence no longer could have identical elements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that under Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, &sect; 100.5270 (2002), the net capital losses of the members of a unitary group were pre-apportionment elements of each member's base income, to be allocated among them in the manner prescribed by Treas. Regs. &sect;&sect; 1.1502-21 and 1.1502-22. The rules clarified that, contrary to the taxpayer's contention, the 35 ILCS 5/304(e) (2002) requirement that the base income of a unitary group was to be allocated under the combined apportionment method did not apply to net capital losses, which were a pre-apportionment element of that base income. Regardless of whether the federal regulations incorporated by reference in Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, &sect; 100.5270(a)(1) had any applicability to Illinois net losses, it was clear from the that language that the federal regulations were the only provisions that governed the allocation of capital losses to members of a unitary group. The Department's method used to allocate the parent company's 2002 net capital losses did not appear improper merely because of the manner in which it apportioned the taxpayer's 1999 net capital gain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public officials challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Sangamon County, Illinois, which issued a permanent injunction in favor of appellee pharmacy objectors prohibiting the public officials from enforcing the Current Rule, Ill. Admin. Code tit. 68, &sect; 1330.500.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The objectors contended that the Current Rule violated the Illinois Health Care Right of Conscience Act (Conscience Act), 745 ILCS 70/1 to 14 (2010). The trial court found that two of the objectors had sincere religious and conscious-based objections to participating in the distribution of Plan B contraceptives. A permanent injunction was issued, and this appeal followed. In partially affirming, the appellate court determined that the Conscious Act did not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion, but instead bolstered it. Next, the Conscience Act applied to the practice of pharmacy. Because a pharmacy was a location where medication services were provided, it was a health care facility as defined in the Conscience Act. Moreover, the provision of emergency contraceptives was not emergency medical care as contemplated by the Conscience Act. However, the permanent injunction issued in this case was overly broad. The Current Rule did not violate the Conscience Act, but its enforcement against the objectors on the issue of emergency contraceptives did.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the decision finding that the Current Rule could not have been enforced against the objectors was affirmed. The granting of a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the rule was reversed. The injunction was modified to state that the Current Rule could not have been enforced against the objectors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that vacated a protective supervision order that returned custody of her minor son to the Guardianship Administrator of the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the juvenile court erred by returning custody of her son to the DCFS under 705 ILCS 405/2-27. The court of appeals disagreed. The procedural posture of the case did not preclude the juvenile court from taking the action it did. While all parties would have been better served by the filing of supplemental petitions seeking a return of guardianship to DCFS and alleging a violation of the protective supervision order, neither precedent nor statute precluded the juvenile court from acting in conformity with the child's best interests, even when the mother was not at fault for being unable to provide the care for the child's needs. The entry of a protective supervision order permitted the juvenile court to enter a modified dispositional order following an evidentiary hearing. The mother was at the end of her rope in dealing with the child at the time he was hospitalized for the fourth time. The juvenile court properly found that it was in the child's best interests to return guardianship to DCFS while additional services were provided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants were firefighters whose trucks used the manufacturer's sirens. They alleged that the sirens were unreasonably dangerous and defective because the sirens had exposed them to excessive noise, causing hearing loss. The claimants' expert witness, a research scientist in acoustics who had designed noise control systems, testified that the sirens were unreasonably dangerous and could have been designed not to emit excessive noise rearward. The expert tested his opinion using a computer model to create feasible alternative designs. The court held that the claimants were not required to prove a feasible alternative design, which was merely one of the factors to consider, even when a public safety device was involved. The expert was qualified to testify that the sirens were defectively designed. The use of a computer model instead of a prototype did not render the testimony speculative. Excluding evidence of hearing protection in other fire departments, on the ground that the danger of confusion and prejudice substantially outweighed the probative value, was not error in light of the manufacturer's nondelegable duty to ensure that its product was not unreasonably dangerous.</SPAN></P>

After she left defendant's residence, she met with the two police officers to hand over the drugs and the video camera.

The jury convicted him of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance in violation of 720 ILCS 570/401(d) (2008). On appeal, he claimed that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel should have filed a motion to suppress the video recording as violative of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prospective father and mother began living together as a couple. They then became engaged. Thereafter, the mother went to Slovakia to visit family. While there, she met the minor child. The mother commenced the process of adopting her under Slovakian law. During the year-long adoption process, the mother lived in Slovakia. Under Slovakian law, the prospective father was not permitted to adopt her  because he was neither a Slovakian national nor married to the mother. The prospective father did not try to adopt the minor child when she and the mother returned to Illinois nor did he marry the mother. Instead, he filed contract claims and claims for custody, visitation, and child support seeking a declaration of parental rights over the minor child. The trial court eventually dismissed all of those claims. The appellate court found that the prospective father lacked standing with regard to his claims under the Parentage Act of 1984, 750 ILCS 45/2 (2010) and the Dissolution Act, 750 ILCS 5/601(b)(2) (2010) because he was not the minor child's biological father or her adoptive father, and the mother who had custody of her was a fit parent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of two counts of armed robbery, 720 ILCS 5/18-2(a)(2) (2008). The trial court sentenced him to two concurrent prison terms of 40 years. Each term included a 15-year enhancement under the armed-robbery statute,&nbsp;720 ILCS 5/18-2(b) (2008). On appeal, he claimed that: (1) the trial court failed to admonish him about the potential penalties he faced, as Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 401(a)(2) required it to do, meaning his waiver of counsel was invalid; (2) it violated Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402(f) when it considered, in sentencing him, statements he made in a letter he sent to it; and (3) the 15-year enhancements were void ab initio because they violated the Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 proportionate penalties clause. The appellate court found that the trial court did violate Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 401(a)(2) in the way he indicated, meaning he was entitled to a new sentencing hearing. It also found that Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402(f) did not apply because he never offered to plea guilty in the letter. Finally, it found that the 15-year enhancements were void ab initio, and, thus, the fact that it was included in amended legislation meant that it still could not be constitutionally applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the convictions, but vacated the posttrial motion rulings and vacated the sentences. It also remanded the case to the trial court with directions to give defendant a new posttrial hearing and a new sentencing hearing, either with the assistance of counsel or, after fully complying with the applicable rule, without the assistance of counsel. It added that the new sentences could not include the 15-year enhancements.</SPAN></P>

The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner was the owner and operator of a continuing care retirement community. The owner of the property owner was a pontifical institute that was part of the Roman Catholic Church. The property owner applied for an exemption from a particular year's real estate taxes for that community based on claimed religious and charitable uses of the property. Defendant Board recommended that the exemption be denied and the Director affirmed. The trial court affirmed. The appellate court found that despite the claimed religious and charitable uses of the property, the operation of the community was businesslike and characteristic of a commercial enterprise because it was not giving care to the elderly; it was selling care to the elderly, as well as a certain lifestyle for those in independent living, at competitive market rates. It also found that the primary purpose of the community was to house and serve upscale senior citizens. As a result, it found that the property owner was not entitled to a 35 ILCS 200/15-40(a)(1) (2006) religious tax exemption or a 35 ILCS 200/15-65 (2006) charitable property tax exemption because it was operating the community with a view to profit.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the Department's motion for summary judgment on the complaint filed by the employer and alleged employees and also denied their summary judgment motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three high school students drowned in a river after they surreptitiously left a dormitory in the middle of the night to ride paddleboats. Thereafter, wrongful death lawsuits were filed. The trial court granted the school entities' motion to dismiss based upon 745 ILCS 10/3-110 (2008). This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that 745 ILCS 10/3-109 (2008) did not apply to this case. The paddleboat excursion that led to the deaths in this case was not conducted by the school entities within the meaning of 745 ILCS 10/3-109 since it was not done at the direction of the school entities. The paddleboat excursion was not conducted on property of a local public entity, as required by 745 ILCS 10/3-109. Next, 745 ILCS 10/3-110 applied to the school entities without regard to their status as landlocked or riparian. However, the school entities were not supervising the river at issue in this case. There was no exception in 745 ILCS 10/3-110 for willful and wanton misconduct, and 745 ILCS 10/3-108 (2008) was not applied to narrow the scope of immunity under 745 ILCS 10/3-110. Finally, several constitutional arguments were rejected.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he argued that: (1) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel; and (2) a new sentencing hearing was warranted because 15-year sentencing enhancements were void. The appellate court found that he did not show that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because he could not show what his trial counsel did was either not sound trial strategy or that he was prejudiced by any deficient performance. However, it also found that the 15-year sentencing enhancements imposed on defendant's sentences for armed robbery and aggravated vehicular hijacking violated the Ill. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife, who were both older than 60-years-old, were French citizens who married in France. Both of them were retired. Their marriage lasted about 10 months before the husband filed a petition for divorce in France. Thereafter, the husband voluntarily dismissed his divorce action in France and filed a petition to dissolve the marriage in Illinois. The husband's connection with Illinois was that he owned some properties there, and had paid Illinois real estate and income taxes there. Also, the parties had briefly resided in Illinois during their marriage. The wife had lived almost her entire life in France and the parties' main sources of income were in France. The trial court granted the wife's motion for dismissal on forum non conveniens grounds. The appellate court found that dismissal was allowed under the doctrine of forum non conveniens and Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 187, which did not indicate that the doctrine could not be applied internationally in scope. It also found that the trial court properly weighed the public and private interests factors in concluding that the ties to Illinois in the case were so minimal that transfer of the case to France was warranted.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, guardianship of him was returned to his foster mother, under a 705 ILCS 405/2-24 (2010) protective supervision order. A hearing was then held for possible closure of the minor son's case. The juvenile court heard evidence, which indicated that the foster mother through no fault of her own could not cope with the minor son's problems. As a result, the juvenile court vacated the protective supervision order, which had the effect of reverting custody of the minor son to the State and issued a modified dispositional order pursuant to 705 ILCS 405/2-27 (2010) of the Act that found the foster mother was unable to provide for him. The appellate court found that the juvenile court's rulings vacating the supervision order and modifying the dispositional order were not against the manifest weight of the evidence or an abuse of discretion when the minor son's best interests were considered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school board appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which dismissed its complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants, two unions, the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board, and the Illinois Labor Relations Board, raising issues as to the constitutionality of 2009 Ill. Laws 1257 and which agency had jurisdiction over unfair labor practice claims and bargaining-unit rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to 5 ILCS 315/3(n), (o) (2010) as amended by 2009 Ill. Laws 1257, peace officers directly employed by a school district on the act's effective date were reclassified as public employees and the district as a public employer, thus precluding the officers from striking under 5 ILCS 315/17 but also entitling them to interest arbitration under 5 ILCS 315/14. The school board, whose district was the only school district that directly employed peace officers, asserted that the amendment was special legislation in violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13. The court noted that the prohibition against special legislation did not per se prohibit legislation regulating a generally defined class with only one member. Although the reclassification reasonably addressed a legitimate state interest in ensuring that all police officers were barred from striking, the court concluded that a distinction between officers employed currently and in the future was arbitrary. Moreover, the school board was not required to await a certification decision under 5 ILCS 315/9(b) (2010) because an exception to the exhaustion requirement for challenges to an administrative agency's jurisdiction applied.</SPAN></P>

Appellees argued that the Illinois General Assembly opted out of the benefits bar pursuant to 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1621(d). The circuit court found that the General Assembly opted out of 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1621(a) pursuant to 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1621(d). The appellate court ruled that 305 ILCS 5/1-11 and 305 ILCS 5/12-4.35 (2008) evidenced the positive Legislative intent required by 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1621(d) to opt out of 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1621(a) and provide coverage for unlawful aliens.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, granting defendant's motion to quash his arrest and suppress statements he made related to his arrest on the ground that his arrest was extraterritorial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested in a particular town without anyone present from that town, state, or federal police departments; instead the arresting officers were from another city. The court held that the trial court did not err by quashing defendant's arrest and suppressing his statements made related to his arrest because defendant's act, the police surveillance, the stop and search of defendant and his home, and defendant's arrest all occurred outside the officers' jurisdiction, as 65 ILCS 5/7-4-8 (2010) required municipalities to actually share a border for a police officer to invoke authority pursuant to 725 ILCS 5/107-4 (2010). The court rejected the State's argument that defendant's statements should not have been suppressed on the ground that his arrest was the result of a lawful Terry stop and supported by probable cause because it was not a Terry stop, as defendant was spotted leaving his house and entering the vehicle without any suspicious packages or mannerisms. In addition, because the officers were not acting within legal authority, the exclusionary rule barred defendant's initial statements to the police. Defendant's second statement was also properly suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon and was sentenced to one year in prison upon the conviction that was entered. On appeal, defendant claimed his conviction had to be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial because: (1) the prosecutor's misstatement of the evidence during rebuttal argument was prejudicial error; (2) the Illinois aggravated unlawful use of a weapon statute is unconstitutional; (3) one of the jurors who convicted him did not reside in the forum county; and (4) the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to exclude evidence of cannabis found in his car because it was not relevant to the charge against him. The appellate court found that even though defendant did not object regarding the prosecutor's misstatement, that issue was dispositive of the appeal. It found that it could review the misstatement made in closing argument, that defendant knew there was a gun in his car, under the plain error doctrine because defendant's substantial right to a fair trial was affected given that there was no such evidence in the record and he had consistently denied knowing that there was a gun in his car.</SPAN></P>

On appeal to the trial court, she raised a number of issues, including challenging the constitutionality of several of the ordinances involved. The trial court denied her request to find Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 7-24-225 (2004) and Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 2-14-132 (2009), regarding impoundment procedures, unconstitutional. The appellate court found that the ordinances did not violate her substantive due process rights and was not an unreasonable seizure, as the city was not required to include an innocent owner defense in the ordinances because not doing encouraged car owners not to lend their vehicles to people likely to engage in criminal activity in them, and her vehicle was otherwise constitutionally impounded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially, the court followed Illinois Supreme Court precedent that upheld the constitutionality of the automatic transfer provision of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, 705 ILCS 405/1-1 et seq.

The youth officer did not attempt to contact defendant's parents or any other adult concerned for defendant's welfare in violation of 705 ILCS 405/5-405(2); instead, the officer attempted to contact two employees of the facility where defendant was residing on a Sunday night and began questioning just minutes after leaving messages at their office numbers. Defendant was improperly barred under the rape shield law, 725 ILCS 5/115-7(a) (2008), from presenting evidence that the complainant had had sexual intercourse with her boyfriend prior to her medical examination, which would explain redness found on her cervix, as such evidence would be relevant to the theory of the defense; defendant testified that, contrary to his typewritten statement to the police, that the complainant had initiated the sexual contact and had only performed oral sex briefly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being charged with eight counts of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon and one count of being an armed habitual criminal, defendant filed motions to quash the arrest and suppress evidence, claiming that the police did not have the authority to enter and search his home without a warrant. After the suppression hearing, the court granted defendant's motions. The State filed a motion to reconsider, which it later supplemented, and the court denied the State's motion. The State appealed and the appellate court reversed. There were reasonable grounds to believe that an emergency existed under the emergency-aid exception to U.S. Const. amend. IV. To hold that the police could not enter an apartment to search for gunshot victims when multiple 911 calls informed them that gunshots had been heard inside the apartment would undermine the purpose of the 911 system and unreasonably delay medical attention to people in need of immediate assistance. Further, the police officers' command to exit the apartment was not enough to violate U.S. Const. amend. IV. The police had the right to enter the apartment because both prongs of the emergency-aid exception had been satisfied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent juvenile appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicting him under the Extended Jurisdiction Juvenile (EJJ) Prosecutions statute,&nbsp;705 ILCS 405/5-810 (2008), of first-degree murder and sentencing him to the maximum juvenile sentence of incarceration until his 21st birthday and a 20-year stayed adult sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by designating the juvenile's first-degree murder proceeding as an EJJ prosecution because there was no evidence that the trial court failed to consider all of the enumerated factors under 705 ILCS 405/5-810 (2008) and the trial court noted that the crime was extremely serious, as the juvenile and his co-offenders used their fists, feet, a broken aluminum bat, and concrete chunks to kill the victim. The court held that Apprendi did not apply to the EJJ prosecution statute because the statute decided which forum would hear a juvenile's case, and it did not determine the juvenile's guilt or the specific sentence. The court held that the EJJ prosecution statute was not void for vagueness because it provided people with ordinary intelligence with the opportunity to understand what conduct was prohibited and provided a reasonable standard to law enforcement and the judiciary to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory legal enforcement. The juvenile's as applied challenge failed under the invited error doctrine because he introduced the challenged sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a simultaneous but severed bench trial with a codefendant, defendant was convicted of attempted first-degree murder and armed robbery, and was sentenced to two consecutive 18-year prison terms. Thereafter, the trial court on the State's motion dismissed defendant's successive postconviction petition. On appeal, defendant contended that his appointed postconviction counsel provided unreasonable assistance under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651(c) regarding postconviction counsel's presentation of a defendant's claims. He argued that counsel attempted but failed to adopt claims that he raised in various pro se pleadings, and failed to make amendments that would have preserved his claims against procedural bars. The appellate court found that in the present case, postconviction counsel filed an Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651(c) certificate, thus triggering the presumption of compliance with that rule. It then found that defendant had failed to rebut that presumption, which meant that the appellate court could not find that counsel provided an unreasonable level of assistance. As a result, it found that the trial court was authorized to dismiss defendant's postconviction relief petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found the male to be subject to involuntary admission to a state mental health or developmental center. Its judgment held that he was subject to involuntary admission because he was a person with a mental illness who, because of it, was unable to provide for his basic physical needs so as to guard himself from serious harm. The finding was made after the State and the male stipulated to the admission of the reports of two examiners, the same as if they had taken the witness stand and testified, and that stipulation was approved by the trial court. On appeal, he challenged the involuntarily admission order. Although its  time period had expired, the appellate court found it could consider the appeal under the mootness doctrine's public interest exception. It then found that 405 ILCS 5/3-808 (2010) clear and convincing evidence supported the involuntary admission. It so concluded because it determined that the process of stipulating to the two examiners' reports was allowed pursuant to 405 ILCS 5/3-807 (2010) of the Mental Health Code and the evidence presented showed he was unable to provide for his basic physical needs so as to guard himself from serious harm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist was driving on a street when the truck driver, who was intoxicated, lost control of his truck on an ice patch on the street and it collided with her vehicle.

The truck driver timely counterclaimed against the city for contribution for the negligent maintenance of a water main that broke and allowed the ice to form. More than two years after the accident, she tried to add the city as a defendant, but the trial court would not allow it. He admitted liability. A jury then found for her, determined that he was 65 percent at fault and the city was 35 percent at fault, and awarded her $ 585,174.23 in damages. The appellate court found that: (1) the trial court properly barred her from adding the city as a direct defendant, as 735 ILCS 5/2-406 (2008) allowing the addition of third-party defendants did not toll 745 ILCS 10/8-101(a) (2008)'s one-year limitations period for suing the city directly; (2) the city under 740 ILCS 100/2(b) (2008) could not be liable for contribution until the truck driver paid more than his pro rata share of the common liability and he had not done so; and (3) the city did not have discretionary immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant condominium unit owner (UO) appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which struck her affirmative defenses (ADs), severed her counterclaim, and granted judgment in favor of plaintiff condominium association (CA). The trial court awarded the CA possession of the UO's unit under the Forcible Entry and Detainer Act (FEDA), 735 ILCS 5/9-111 (2010), as well as various monetary awards. The UO cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The CA filed suit against the UO, seeking possession of her unit and various unpaid assessments and fees due to the UO's alleged failure to pay the monthly assessments and common expenses. Claims were based on breach of contract and the FEDA. The UO filed ADs and a counterclaim, based on the CA's alleged failure to maintain the exterior of the building. She asserted that such failure resulted in damage to the interior of the unit. The UO further asserted that the CA failed to repair a toilet that it damaged while attempting to find the source of a leak. The trial court granted the CA's motion to strike the ADs and to sever her counterclaim. After a bench trial, judgment was entered for the CA. On appeal, the court held that the UO could assert ADs and counterclaims that were germane to the purpose of the CA's proceeding under 735 ILCS 5/9-106 (2010) and the Condominium Property Act, 765 ILCS 605/18.4 (2010). As some ADs and the counterclaim were based on damages to her individual unit only, they were properly removed from the action. However, allegations regarding the CA's failure to maintain and repair the common elements should have been permitted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court as to the severance of the UO's counterclaim, and as to the striking of her ADs to the extent that they were based on the CA's neglect of her unit. The court reversed the judgment as to the striking of the ADs relating to the CA's neglect of its duty to repair and maintain the common elements. The matter was remanded for reinstatement of the noted ADs and for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardians sought to pay the administrative expenses of the guardianship first and to pay the expenses of the other creditors second. The probate court granted the bank's turnover motion. The probate court found that the judgment liens recorded by the bank after a deficiency judgment had priority over the unperfected award of attorney fees and other fees/expenses approved in the guardianship estate. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court rejected the argument that 735 ILCS 5/12-103 (2010) was support for the argument that the Illinois Civil Practice law contemplated judgment liens attaching to property held in guardianship estates. The assets of the estate were not in custodia legis. Therefore, they were subject to levy or attachment by the bank. 755 ILCS 5/18-10, 18-13 (2010) did not provide guidance relating to the distribution of a guardianship estate. The awarding of allowances in the guardianship estate did not automatically divest the estate of those funds such that they were no longer in the estate. The lis pendens served on the bank did not pertain to priority, and the bank was not bound by the award of fees and expenses simply because it was a party.</SPAN></P>

The bonds complied with both the Public Community College Act, 110 ILCS 805/3A-1 et seq. (2002), and the Bond Authorization Act because the interest rates did not exceed the 9% ceiling. Other than not exceeding the maximum interest rate of 9%, no restriction regarding interest rates appears in the Public Community College Act or the Bond Authorization Act. No language in the Registered Bond Act and the Local Government Debt Reform Act mandated that bonds authorized under the Public Community College Act be issued at the lowest interest rates possible.</SPAN></P>

(2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, who had been convicted of rape and sexual assault, was found by a jury to be a sexually violent person and was committed. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in allowing the State to obtain a second psychological evaluation from the Illinois Department of Corrections after the first evaluator retired. Because 725 ILCS 207/35(b) did not limit the State to using the first evaluation, the State was not obliged to call the first evaluator as a witness even if he was available. Because respondent presented the testimony of his own expert, who had the advantage of multiple personal interviews with him, he was not deprived of evidence of an &quot;equal quality&quot; with the State's evidence. Further, a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent was a sexually violent person. The State's two psychologists diagnosed him with paraphilia. He failed to avail himself of sex offender treatment while incarcerated. There was evidence that he had exposed himself while incarcerated. Finally, the trial court did not err under &sect; 40(b)(2) in failing to place him on conditional release based on his antipathy toward treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of DuPage County, Illinois, dismissed plaintiff resident's complaint against defendant government officials arguing that a $5 fee that the legislature added in 2008 to the cost of a marriage license was an unconstitutional tax on marriage. The resident appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that the resident's complaint was framed solely as a facial challenge to the validity of the additional $5 fee for marriage licenses, 55 ILCS 5/4-12003, 4-4001 (2010). The resident argued that the fee violated the tax uniformity clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2. The appellate court found the some people who get married would need to utilize free legal services in order to remove themselves from abusive marital relationships. There was a reasonable relationship between those who were to pay the tax and the object of the legislation. The tax only benefitted married and formerly married people who needed services because of marital domestic violence. Requiring marriage license applicants to pay a fee to help a victim of domestic violence leave a violent marriage was neither unfair nor unreasonable, even if that victim never paid the fee. The legislature's choice to make distinctions between married and unmarried people was proper. The legislature's imposition of a small charge on marriage license applicants was reasonably related to the fund's narrow purpose of helping married victims of domestic violence leave violent marriages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, found defendant guilty of two counts of armed robbery and sentenced him to two concurrent 45-year prison terms (30 years for armed robbery plus an additional 15-year firearm enhancement). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals rejected defendant's contention that a photo lineup and physical lineup were impermissibly suggestive. There was nothing so different about defendant during any of the lineups that would have led witnesses to pick him out. Although the red shirt defendant wore in the physical lineup could have been considered suggestive, both witnesses gave similar physical descriptions of the gunman immediately following the robbery; both identified defendant as the gunman from the photo lineup without hesitation even though the photo used was seven years old; and the physical lineup was conducted just over a month after the robbery and neither witness knew defendant prior to the robbery. The fact that another lineup participant wore a green shirt made defendant's red shirt even less significant. The court also held that the trial court conducted an adequate inquiry into defendant's allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. Finally, the 15-year sentence enhancement for armed robbery with a firearm violated the proportionate penalties clause. An amendment to the armed violence statute did not change the statute's pre-amendment meaning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of the trial court that denied defendant's motion to suppress identification testimony and denied defendant's pro se posttrial motion for ineffective assistance of counsel. The court vacated defendant's sentences and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that 625 ILCS 5/11-501(d)(2)(G) (2008), which permitted probation for aggravated DUI only in extraordinary circumstances, was not unconstitutionally vague due to the fact that it did not define &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; because: (1) &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; was capable of being understood by its plain and ordinary meaning; (2) the statute provided sufficient guidance such that reasonable defendants and sentencing judges were not without objective criteria for its application, as &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; contemplated those that were mitigating, which were defined in 730 ILCS 5/5-5-3.1 (2006); and (3) the legislative objective behind the statute, a presumption of incarceration, sufficiently guided its application. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing defendant to 15 years' imprisonment because it was not unreasonable in finding that the following factors were not extraordinary in light of the offense, in which five teenagers were killed and four others were injured: (1) defendant's good intentions but poor judgment; (2) her sincere and profound remorse; and (3) the hardship that her incarceration would have on her family.</SPAN></P>

(2006). Plaintiff casino, which had contributed to the Fund based on recent legislation passed to assist the Illinois horse racing industry, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois legislature found riverboat gaming casinos in Illinois negatively impacted the Illinois horse racing industry. Under legislation it passed, certain casinos had to deposit a certain percentage of their adjusted gross receipts daily into a Horse Racing Equity Trust Fund (Fund) for a certain time period. Part of the Fund monies were distributed to qualifying organization licensees to be used for upgrading and operating their racing facilities. The Board then had to determine how to distribute the monies. It found that under 230 ILCS 5/54.5(b)(2)(B) (2006)'s distribution scheme, &quot;handle,&quot; or wager amounts, generated by an ineligible licensee at a track operated by an eligible licensee should be added to the handle of the eligible licensee to calculate the pro rata share due the eligible licensee. The casino appealed and claimed that the distribution scheme unfairly impacted it. The trial court affirmed. The appellate court found that the Board's interpretation was reasonable and, thus, had to be upheld, but overturned its actual distribution calculation of the pro rata shares because state fairs were receiving less of the Fund monies than they should have received.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the Board's decision regarding how distributions under the relevant statute should be determined.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the automatic transfer provision of the Illinois Juvenile Court Act of 1987, 705 ILCS 405/5-130 (2004), violated substantive due process because juveniles were transferred to adult court without any investigation to determine if transfer is appropriate, and procedural due process because transferring juveniles to adult court without a hearing bore no rational relationship to any legitimate government purpose. The appellate court found that defendant's argument was without merit and his substantive due process rights were not violated when he was automatically transferred to adult court. The automatic transfer provision did not allow any discretion in the transferring of juveniles to adult court, as every 15- and 16-year-old charged with one of the enumerated offenses was automatically transferred and prosecuted. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's petition for leave to file a successive postconviction petition because he failed to satisfy the cause-and-prejudice test, 725 ILCS 5/122-1(f). The knowing and voluntary nature of defendant's statement was not diminished by the finding of unfitness many months after the statement was made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of aggravated vehicular hijacking under 720 ILCS 5/18-4(a)(3) (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction for aggravated vehicular hijacking and the appellate court reversed and remanded for a new trial on the limited issue of whether defendant was guilty of aggravated vehicular hijacking under the pre-amended version of 720 ILCS 5/18-4(a)(3) (1998). The definition of &quot;dangerous weapon&quot; given by the trial court enabled the jury to impermissibly sidestep disputed factual issues as long as it found that defendant's weapon was a handgun. It was arguable that its request for clarification as to the definition of &quot;dangerous weapon&quot; indicated uncertainty. But, upon receiving the trial court's definition, the jury believed any such inquiry to have been foreclosed by a finding that defendant's weapon was a handgun, which was listed, without any further qualification, as a dangerous weapon in the erroneous definition laid out by the trial court. However, it was not disputed that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of the lesser included offense of simple vehicular hijacking, nor would the incorrect definition of &quot;dangerous weapon&quot; have had any impact upon the jury's determination of whether defendant committed that lesser included offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer, as subrogee pursuant to an insurance policy, filed a complaint against appellee motorist in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), alleging that the motorist's negligent and careless actions in the operation of a motor vehicle directly and proximately caused the insured's physical injuries. The court dismissed the complaint with prejudice and later denied the insurer's motion for reconsideration. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An insured person under a policy issued by the insurer was allegedly struck and injured by an automobile that was driven by the motorist. The insurer voluntarily dismissed its first negligence cause of action against the motorist. The insurer later filed another negligence complaint against the motorist. However, the motorist argued that the second complaint was filed after the two-year statute of limitations period for personal injury claims had expired and did not relate back to the first cause of action under 735 ILCS 5/2-616(b) (2010). On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in dismissing the second complaint. The second complaint was not an amended pleading to the original lawsuit and, thus, was not subject to &sect; 2-616(b). Instead, the second complaint was a refiled cause of action under 735 ILCS 5/13-217 (1994) which arose from the same group of operative facts. Moreover, the original complaint was filed within the two-year statute of limitations period for claims sounding in tort pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/13-202 and 735 ILCS 5/13-203 (2010). Finally, the insurer timely refiled the cause of action against the motorist within the one-year period of 735 ILCS 5/13-217.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Probation for a conviction for aggravated DUI was only allowable when extraordinary circumstances were found under 625 ILCS 5/11-501(d)(2)(G) (2008).

The fact that the legislature empowered sentencing courts with discretion in determining what circumstances could be considered extraordinary did not render the statute unconstitutionally vague. In this case, the trial court's sentence of four years did not amount to an abuse of discretion because extraordinary circumstances were lacking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissing his postconviction petition, filed under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 ILCS 5/122-1 to 122-8 (2008), after a full evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant's postconviction petition was timely filed and therefore was not moot merely because he had completed serving his 25-year sentence because he was still serving his sentence when he filed his petition. The court held that the trial court properly ruled that the testimony from the various postconviction witnesses was unreliable and would not have resulted in a different outcome at retrial because both defense counsel and a detective interviewed a fellow gang member of defendant who denied shooting the victim and provided an alibi. Witnesses' testimony providing an alibi for defendant were contradictory to each other and to the evidence produced at trial. The court held that because defendant could not establish any due process violation, he was not entitled to relief based on a witness' postconviction testimony that, years later, she was no longer sure that defendant was one of the gunmen who murdered the victim. The court also rejected defendant's Brady claim based on the witness' recantation because her postconviction testimony lacked credibility and was rebutted by other testimony at the hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) armed robbery while armed with a firearm and two counts of aggravated kidnaping while armed with a firearm. The trial court sentenced defendant to 20 years' imprisonment for armed robbery and 20 years for aggravated kidnaping, to run concurrently. After his motion for postconviction relief was denied, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his convictions violated the proportionate penalties clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court of appeals agreed. Since the penalties for armed robbery while armed with a firearm and for aggravated kidnaping were harsher than the penalty for armed violence, defendant's sentences for armed robbery while armed with a firearm and for aggravated kidnaping violated the proportionate penalties clause. The trial court declined to impose the 15-year add-on penalty to either of defendant's sentences, and his 20-year sentences were, therefore, proper. However, the trial court stated that the reason why it declined to add the 15-year enhancement was that the State did not give proper notice to defendant that it would seek the enhancement, and not that it had any doubts as to whether the add-on penalty was valid. Accordingly, while the sentence imposed by the trial court was proper, the appropriate remedy was to remand for sentencing in order to allow the trial court to determine defendant's sentence for each offense while taking into account the totality of his sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court held that the trial court properly found that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his Miranda rights, despite evidence that his full-scale IQ score was 64 and that he operated at the intellectual level of a five- to nine-year-old child. The other evidence included that defendant had been both informed of and waived his Miranda rights on multiple occasions, and the expert testimony regarding defendant's ability to understand those warnings was at best equivocal. Thus, defendant's motion to suppress the statement was properly denied. The court also held it did not violate the Eighth Amendment to impose a mandatory life sentence without parole, despite defendant's diminished mental capacity and the fact that he was convicted on a theory of accountability. The evidence established that he was an admitted gang member with a significant criminal history and that he was aware of the robbery plan before he traveled to the victim's home, knew that his accomplice's gun was loaded, as he had previously examined it, knew that the accomplice intended to kill the victim, concealed his face before entering the victim's home, and actively participated in the robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the State, in presenting the case before the grand jury, violated defendant's due process rights by incorrectly stating that 815 ILCS 515/3(c), which had been found unconstitutional, would allow it to presume defendant's intent. The State also incorrectly stated that intent was not an element to be proven. The two misstatements affected the grand jury proceedings because without them, the court could not say that a true bill would have been returned. The court declined to reverse the conviction outright. After reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the court concluded that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime of home repair fraud beyond a reasonable doubt. The State only had to prove at trial whether defendant had intended to perform the promised work at the time he entered into a home repair contract with the victim. Circumstantial evidence showed that at the time of the agreement, defendant did not intend to perform.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded with directions to dismiss the indictment without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

(2010) (Act), by misclassifying six workers as nonemployees on two construction projects. Instead of responding, the painting company filed its complaint alleging the Act was unconstitutional on its face. Specifically, it alleged the Act violated due process by failing to provide contractors suspected of violating the Act adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard before penalties were imposed. It persuaded the trial court to grant a preliminary injunction barring the state labor director and state attorney general from enforcing the Act while trial proceedings were pending. The appellate court found that since the parties agreed to a constitutional plan for conducting their interaction as the possible violations of the Act were investigated, primarily by forbidding the Department from making any adjudicatory findings of liability, the painting company's due process claim failed and it was not entitled to a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant saw police officers as he was robbing another man and fled into a building; in doing so, he dropped a rifle.

He claimed he had been invited to stay at the building and had not possessed the rifle. After a bench trial, he was convicted on all counts and sentenced to 11 years in prison. The trial court effectively denied his motion to substitute counsel prior to post-trial proceedings. The appellate court found, inter alia, that: (1) he was not prejudiced by the indictment not stating he was not the invitee of another person as it did not prejudice his defense, which the evidence did not support; (2) the evidence supported his convictions; (3) he showed neither judicial bias nor ineffective assistance of counsel; (4) his motion to substitute counsel should have been allowed since counsel was ready to enter the case right before post-trial proceedings; (5) a three-year mandatory supervised release term was properly imposed; and (6) the AUUW statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, convicted defendant of attempted first degree murder. The trial court imposed a term of 31 years' imprisonment, which included an additional term of 25 years for personally discharging a firearm that proximately caused great bodily harm to another person. Defendant's motion to reconsider his sentence was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence supported his assertion that his attorney could have shown that defendant was acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation when he shot the victim. The appellate court found that the record refuted defendant's claim of serious provocation. There was no mutual combat as the fight was not on equal terms. The victim punched defendant one time. Defendant's response of pulling out a gun and firing it multiple times, striking the victim three times, was out of all proportion to the victim's provocation. Defendant could not show that a reasonable probability existed that the result of the proceeding would have been different had counsel referenced 720 ILCS 5/8-4(c)(1)(E) because this section did not apply under the facts of this case. No mitigating circumstances were present because the evidence did not support a finding that defendant acted under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation. Firearm enhancement provisions for attempted first degree murder did not shock the moral sense of the community. 720 ILCS 5/8-4(c)(1)(D) was not unconstitutional,&nbsp;Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's complaint alleged that former 730 ILCS 5/3-8-7 had been applied in his disciplinary proceedings after the statute was found unconstitutional because it violated the single-subject rule. The inmate did not cite any specific instances of improper application of former &sect; 3-8-7 in his disciplinary proceedings. The court observed that the inmate could not state a cause of action for mandamus or any other form of relief based on disciplinary actions after a reenactment of &sect; 3-8-7 that followed the unconstitutionality finding. As to disciplinary actions that occurred between the dates of the unconstitutionality finding and the reenactment, there was no due-process violation because the provisions of former &sect; 3-8-7 did not affect the inmate's due-process rights; moreover, the inmate had no state-created liberty or property interest in the provisions of former &sect; 3-8-7 because the statute had not created any more rights for inmates than those constitutionally required.

Section 10-5(b)(10) was not void for vagueness because the phrase &quot;for other than a lawful purpose&quot; informed defendant that if his act of luring was committed with a criminal intent, he was guilty of child abduction. The trial court did not err by denying defendant a bill of particulars because the indictment was not defective due to the fact that it did not allege the specific unlawful purpose that he possessed in committing the crime, since the indictment precisely tracked the language of &sect; 10-5(b)(10).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner acquired real estate through a tax deed, and the home situated on such was later demolished by the city. Thereafter, the owner filed an action against the city, which was dismissed. This appeal followed.

Next, 65 ILCS 5/1-4-7 (2008) was the basis for the owner's wrongful demolition action in this case; therefore, the time limitation in 745 ILCS 10/8-101(a) (2008) did not apply to this action. Moreover, 745 ILCS 10/8-101(a) (2008) also did not apply to the owner's lien-invalidity claim, which sought only a declaration. The city did not assert another basis for dismissal.</SPAN></P>

The parties and the trial court erred by proceeding on the assumption that the petition was a 750 ILCS 45/7(b) petition to declare the nonexistence of a parent and child relationship, subject to the two-year limitations period. The appellate court held that the petition was one to establish a father-child relationship, and it was therefore subject to the 20-year limitations period of 750 ILCS 45/8(a)(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Lake County, Illinois, granted judgment in favor of plaintiff communications company's suit against defendant village, alleging that two of the ordinances that forcibly annexed land adjacent to the village were invalid because they improperly used as a boundary a water feature that did not constitute a &quot;creek,&quot; in violation of 65 ILCS 5/7-1-13 (2008). The village appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that the question was what constituted a &quot;creek&quot; under 65 ILCS 5/7-1-13. The village argued that the statute permitted both natural and unnatural boundaries, such as municipal and state boundaries. The appellate court found that although the statute itself did not contain the word &quot;natural,&quot; the plain meaning of the word &quot;creek&quot; required a natural water feature. The term &quot;creek&quot; as used in &sect; 7-1-13 unambiguously connoted a natural rather than man-made water feature. The village had never previously relied on the use of the water feature or its characterization as a creek. The trial court's finding that the water feature was man-made was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The question boiled down to a batter of the experts, and it was the trial court's role to resolve conflicts in the evidence, assess witnesses' credibility, and determine what weight to give to their testimony. The trial court's acceptance of the expert's opinion that the water feature did not have the characteristics of a creek was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The water feature's straight lines lent additional support to the conclusion that it was man-made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant went to the owner's home to put up Halloween decorations and fell while standing on a wooden wire spool. The claimant alleged the owner failed to provide a safe and stable platform from which he could work, and failed to warn him that the spool he stood upon was or could be unstable and easily tipped. The claimant acknowledged the spool was designed to hold wire and not for a person to stand on. The claimant stated he did not check the stability of the spool before stepping on it, and also did not ask or look for a ladder. Plaintiffs argued that the trial court improperly denied admission into evidence a statement made by the owner that he offered to pay all of the claimant's expenses pertaining to the incident. The appellate court ruled that the statement at issue was barred by 735 ILCS 5/8-1901 (2004) and Ill. R. Evid. 409. Also, there was no err in admitting the shed photographs into evidence. The photos of the shed were relevant. The pictures showed the interior of the shed where the accident took place, as well as the white-painted spool that the claimant stepped on before falling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Du Page County, Illinois, that required him to register as a sex offender, arguing that the circuit court could not logically have found his unlawful restraint conviction to have been sexually motivated where the circuit court acquitted him of the more traditional sex crime with which he was charged, indecent solicitation of a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a discharge hearing under 725 ILCS 5/104-25 (2008), defendant was acquitted of indecent solicitation of a child, but a judgment of nonacquittal was entered on a charge of unlawful restraint. Defendant appealed a subsequent judgment requiring him to register as a sex offender. On review, the court held that the inquiry of whether a person was proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of indecent solicitation was entirely different from the inquiry of whether an unlawful restraint was sexually motivated. The former required a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant, with the intent that the offense of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child be committed, knowingly solicited a child under age 17 to perform an act of sexual penetration pursuant to 720 ILCS 5/11-6(a) (2008), while the latter required a factual finding that the facts underlying the offense of unlawful restraint indicate conduct of a sexual nature or show an intent to engage in sexual behavior pursuant to 20 ILCS 4026/10(e) (2008). That the State was unable to meet the high burden of proving the former did not preclude a court from making the factual finding that the latter, lower standard was satisfied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a criminal appeal, defendant argued the trial court erred by applying a 15-year sentence enhancement to his sentence pursuant to 720 ILCS 5/18-2(b) (2010) based on the use of a firearm during the commission of the robbery. According to defendant, the 15-year sentence enhancement could not be applied against him because it was declared unconstitutional. The Appellate Court of Illinois upheld his sentence. The legislature revived the 15-year sentencing enhancement in the armed-robbery statute by enacting 720 ILCS 5/33A-2(a) (2008); therefore, the trial court correctly applied the sentence enhancement against defendant at sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the search of defendant's vehicle, the officer recovered a weapon. Because the officer testified that he found the gun in the closed and latched center console, it was &quot;encased&quot; for purposes of 720 ILCS 5/24-1.6(a)(1), (a)(3)(A) (2008); the evidence at trial did not prove that the gun was loaded and immediately accessible. The Appellate Court of Illinois vacated defendant's conviction for a second count of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, because the evidence showed he had a valid firearm owner's identification card. Defendant's conviction for the third count was vacated, because there was insufficient proof that he had a loaded firearm on a public street. Proof of the corpus delicti could not rest solely on defendant's statement. Besides a hearsay statement from an anonymous witness to the police, no other witness claimed to have seen defendant on the street with the weapon. The $5 court system fee assessed to him pursuant to 55 ILCS 5/5-1101(a) (2006) was vacated, because defendant was not convicted of violating the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/1-100 et seq.
