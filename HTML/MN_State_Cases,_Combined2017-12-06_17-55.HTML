Stat. &sect; 590.01, subd. 4, to the Minn. R. Crim. P. 27.03, subd. 9 motion violated the separation of powers under Minn. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. Thus, the offender did not need to challenge his conditional-release term in a postconviction petition, and the limitations period in  Minn.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 47.60, 47.601, is constitutional under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, because it does not regulate commerce occurring wholly outside of Minnesota; the payday-lending law included a jurisdictional provision that restricted its regulatory scope to only transactions involving Minnesota residents who completed the transaction while physically located in the state of Minnesota, Minn. Stat. &sect; 47.601, subd. 5; [2]-Because a Delaware company was lending money to residents of Minnesota and making deposits and withdrawals through Minnesota banks, the commerce regulated by Minnesota's payday-lending law was not wholly extraterritorial and the negligible practical effect of the law on the commerce in other states confirmed that it did not violate the extraterritoriality doctrine.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 609.66 because the fact that the bullets were fired in a densely populated urban area in the direction of five individuals, with two of the seven bullets striking the garage behind the victims, supported a finding that defendant discharged a firearm in a reckless manner; [3]-Defendant's mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for a minimum of 30 years was not cruel or unusual and did not violate either U.S. Const. amend.

Stat. &sect; 518B.01, subd. 6a (2012), did not require a district court to make a finding of &quot;domestic abuse&quot; before it extended an order for protection (OFP); [2]-Because subd. 6a required a district court to make specific findings, vested discretion in the district court to determine the length of an extended OFP, and placed appropriate limits on its coverage, the court rejected the ex-husband's facial challenge to subd. 6a(b) under the First Amendment and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 3; [3]-While the court held that the provisions of the OFP that restricted the ex-husband's contact with his ex-wife satisfied Madsen, there were insufficient findings as to his abuse of his children, and therefore the appellate court erred by denying his First Amendment as-applied challenge to the provisions that prohibited him from having contact with his children.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 176.021, subd. 1 (2012) compensation claim for PTSD because findings that PTSD was not compensable under Lockwood for lack of a physical component were not contrary to medical testimony, despite contrary testimony; [2]-There was no compelling reason to overrule Lockwood for excluding mental injury from mental stimulus because Lockwood left compensability to the legislature, which permissibly chose to only prospectively cover PTSD; [3]-Lockwood did not violate equal protection because the distinction between physical and mental injuries applied uniformly to those similarly situated, a distinction between the two injuries was not arbitrary, given more difficulty to prove causation of mental injury, and the distinction effectuated the statutory purpose to balance employer costs against the extent of coverage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and related charges arising out of a motor-vehicle collision in which a deputy sheriff was killed. Appellant was 17-years-old at the time the crimes were committed. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of release. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal in March 1999. The trial court denied his second petition for postconviction relief, which was filed on May 13, 2011, without an evidentiary hearing on the ground that it was time-barred under Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.01, subd. 4(a) (2012). On appeal, the court concluded that the trial court did not err in denying the postconviction petition as untimely. None of the exceptions in &sect; 590.01, subd. 4(b) applied. The rule announced by the United States Supreme Court in Miller was a new rule of constitutional procedure that was neither substantive nor a watershed rule that altered the court's understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding. Appellant was not entitled to the retroactive benefit of Miller in a postconviction proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the sequestration of defendant's girlfriend from voir dire did not violate defendant's constitutional right to a public trial because she was excluded from the courtroom due to the fact that she was a potential witness. The court further held that the removal of the victim's brother from the courtroom during voir dire was too trivial to implicate defendant's right to a public trial under the four Lindsey factors. The trial court did not err by admitting into evidence a folding knife, utility knife, scissors, screwdriver, and hammer found on or with defendant at his campsite at the time of his arrest because while the utility knife, scissors, and screwdriver were not explicitly tied to the crime scene or the murders, they were directly tied to defendant and were the same type of weapon used in the crime. The medical examiner determined that a hammer was the mostly likely blunt-force weapon used to kill the victims and that a single-sided knife was used on both victims.</SPAN></P>

The district court denied the motion, reasoning that fleeing by other means was a general-intent crime. The supreme court held that district court erred by failing to instruct the jury on voluntary intoxication under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.075 (2012) because fleeing a peace officer by means other than a motor vehicle under &sect; 609.487, subd. 6 was a specific-intent crime and defendant satisfied her burden of production on her claim of voluntary intoxication when the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to defendant, showed that defendant consumed alcohol, defendant looked &quot;very confused,&quot; and alcohol limited certain perceptions about what occurred during and after the altercation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The candidate was running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Under Minn. Stat. &sect; 202A.16, subd. 2, voting in each political party's caucus was restricted to persons who were in agreement with the principles of the party and who affiliated or intended to affiliate with the party. The candidate did not support certain of his party's principles, and so, he argued, he was unable to associate with his party's voters or vote at the caucuses, in violation of the First Amendment. He also argued that he bought a public information list of voters in his district from the Secretary of State, but that the list did not include e-mail addresses. The court held that these claims were barred by laches. The 2012 election was complete, and the results had been certified. His claims challenged events that occurred prior to the election; the caucuses had been held 10 months earlier. Allowing his claims would inflict substantial prejudice on his opponent, the voters, and others. His challenge to the district court's refusal to file his election contest did not fit within the narrow parameters of Minn. Stat. &sect; 204B.44.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court had to consider whether the tax court had subject-matter jurisdiction over an appeal from a letter denying a taxpayer's request for a refund. The Supreme Court found that the letter to the taxpayer indicated that the Commissioner carried out his statutory duties with respect to the taxpayer's refund claim. The letter indicated that the Commissioner reviewed the taxpayer's claim based on the record. The Commissioner denied the taxpayer's claim for a refund as time barred and rendered a written decision in the form of a letter and mailed it to the taxpayer. The Commissioner's letter of denial was a final decision on the claim that may be appealed to the tax court. Minnesota law did not authorize the Commissioner to credit a taxpayer's unpaid account based on a refund owed to the taxpayer. Because the taxpayer's refund claim on unpaid claims lacked any legal authority, the supreme court affirmed the denial of this claim. The taxpayer's claim was barred by res judicata because the taxpayer's claim satisfied each criterion and he had a full and fair opportunity to litigate his claim. The tax court did not abuse its discretion by denying the taxpayer's motion to amend.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioner was seeking validation of certain tobacco appropriation bonds to be issued to refund, in advance of maturity, outstanding tobacco securitization bonds issued in 2011. The court concluded that the appropriation refunding bonds do not involve a pledge of the state's full faith, credit, and taxing powers. The bond documents provide that the State is not required to appropriate sufficient funds to make debt service payments. Indeed, if an annual appropriation is not made, the bonds are canceled, and the State does not have any liability or obligation for any unpaid present or future principal or interest payments. The risk of nonpayment is assumed by the bondholders, and this risk is reflected in the bonds' credit ratings and interest rate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In answering the constitutional question, the court concluded that under the plain language of Minn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 4, the appropriation refunding bonds do not constitute public debt for which the State has pledged its full faith, credit, and taxing powers. Accordingly, the bonds are not subject to the constitutional restrictions in Minn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the evidence provided a proper factual basis to support his guilty plea because defendant's five previous incidents of domestic abuse, which occurred over a seven-year period, constituted a regular way of acting sufficient to constitute a past pattern. There was also ample additional evidence in the record supporting a pattern of domestic abuse, including the testimony of grand jury witnesses that defendant was violent with the victim, his wife, forced sex on her, bruised her body, became violent with her many times, was verbally abusive towards her daily, and regularly destroyed the house by punching holes in the walls. There was also sufficient evidence to support the extreme indifference to human life element of defendant's conviction, because defendant admitted that his actions showed an extreme indifference to human life and stated that while arguing with his wife and her daughter, he picked up a knife and when they tried to stop him from killing himself he lunged and pushed them away.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court noted that because the effective date of the amendment in Minn. Stat. 590.01 was August 1, 2005, defendant had until August 1, 2007, to file his petition. However, defendant did not file his second petition for postconviction relief until April 20, 2011, which meant that his petition was untimely unless it satisfied one of the five exceptions to the time bar in Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.01, subd. 4(b). Defendant adequately invoked the interests-of-justice exception, Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.01, subd. 4(b)(5). Defendant's first claim was meritless as the district court convicted and sentenced defendant for two distinct crimes committed upon two distinct victims. Defendant's claim that the felony murder statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.185(a)(2), violated Minn. Const. art. IV, &sect; 17, was frivolous as the statute satisfied the Single Subject and Title Clause because they clearly fell under one general idea. Defendant failed to offer any basis for his claim of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. His fourth claim was frivolous because it was directly contrary to controlling legal authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature had proposed a constitutional amendment requiring photographic identification of voters in elections. The ballot question was: &quot;Shall the Minnesota Constitution be amended to require all voters to present valid photo identification to vote and to require the state to provide free identification to eligible voters, effective July 1, 2013?&quot; The opponents argued that the question was misleading because it did not accurately and factually describe the proposed amendment and did not use the same language (&quot;valid photo identification&quot; versus &quot;government-issued photographic identification&quot;). The court held that under Minn. Stat. &sect; 204B.44, it had subject-matter jurisdiction over the issue of whether the ballot question was so misleading that it deprived voters of the constitutional right to cast a vote for or against the amendment. The court held that just because the ballot question read differently than the proposed constitutional amendment, the ballot question was not so unreasonable and misleading as to be a palpable evasion of the constitutional requirement to submit the proposed amendment to a popular vote.</SPAN></P>

However, only the university's athletic director had the authority to hire respondent. The relationship between respondent and the coach in their discussions of respondent's prospective employment as an assistant basketball coach was that of two sophisticated business people, both watching out for their individual interests while negotiating at arm's length. The legal relationship between respondent and the coach was not the type of relationship entitled to legal protection, and therefore no duty of care against negligent misrepresentation was owed. Thus, respondent's interests in prospective employment with the university's men's basketball program were not entitled to legal protection against the coach's negligent misrepresentations. Because the coach did not owe respondent a duty of care in the negotiations, respondent's claim for negligent misrepresentation failed as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

In the current case, defendant's conviction preceded the narrow construction; thus, due process considerations entitled her to a new trial. The court also held that the statute fell within two of the exceptions to the constitutional prohibition against content discrimination in an unprotected category of speech, in that it was justified by the secondary effects of knowingly false accusations of peace officer misconduct and did not pose a threat of official suppression of ideas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals that the statute was unconstitutional. The court reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial based on its narrowing construction of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 260B.125 (2010), for second-degree felony murder and second-degree manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant claimed that the juvenile court's certification of proceedings was limited to the offense listed in the certification order, which was second-degree intentional murder, and also argued that the certification process violated his right to procedural due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. After granting review, the court affirmed. Because Minn. Stat. &sect; 260B.125 was unambiguous in that it failed to provide a mechanism to return a proceeding to juvenile court if a juvenile was acquitted of the offense expressly referenced in the certification order, the legislature intended for a district court to retain jurisdiction over charges out of the same behavioral incident that supported adult certification. Appellant's procedural due process rights were not violated because he implicitly knew at the time of the certification hearing that he might face the lesser-included offense of second-degree manslaughter since proving the elements of a greater offense necessarily proved the elements of all lesser-included offenses under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.04, subd. 1(4)(2010).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the estate was valued at less than $ 2 million, no federal estate tax was due under I.R.C. &sect; 2010(c) (2006). Appellant claimed, among other things, that Minn. Stat. &sect; 291.215 (2010) was unconstitutional and that federal estate tax law preempted Minnesota estate tax law. On appeal, the court affirmed. While appellant alleged that &sect; 291.215 was unconstitutional as a regressive and non-uniform tax, the estate, since it was valued at less than $2 million, could not elect the alternate valuation date for federal estate tax purposes under I.R.C. &sect; 2032(a)(2), (c) (2006) and, thus, was barred from using such a date for Minnesota estate tax purposes even if the estate decreased in value. Appellant also did not establish that the taxes assessed were unconstitutional simply because they were regressive. The uniformity requirement in Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1 was not violated because appellant did not establish that subjecting estates of different sizes to different valuation rules violated the uniformity requirement. State estate tax law was not preempted because I.R.C. &sect; 2058(a) (2006) presumed that states exact estate taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant attempted to perfect his appeal from his original conviction, but he or his counsel failed to have the transcript produced and transmitted as required. Although defendant's postconviction petition was untimely, he contended that he was permitted to file it based on the interests-of-justice exception in Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.01, subd. 4(b)(5) (2010). The court held that a petition invoking an exception provided in 4(b) must be filed within two years of the date the claim arose. The interests-of-justice exception could only be triggered by an injustice that caused the petitioner to miss the primary deadline in subdivision 4(a), not by the claims forming the substance of the petition. Defendant's interests-of-justice claim based on ineffective assistance of appellate counsel arose on the date he fled the country, because all of his attorney's actions were completed as of that date.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate argued his petition satisfied &sect; 590.01, subd. 4(b)(5)'s interests-of-justice exception to subd. 4(a)'s two-year time limit. The high court held that as subd. 4(c)'s two-year limitations period for raising this exception was not jurisdictional, the State's waived this defense by failing to assert it. As the petition claimed that the warrant to search the inmate's person was not supported by probable cause and that the trial court erred in admitting State v. Spreigl evidence, and the inmate's arguments were supported with good faith interpretations of precedent, the postconviction court erred by finding the petition frivolous. But, the interests of justice did not mandate setting aside the time limit, as the inmate did not show his failure to follow through with his appeal and his delay in seeking postconviction relief was not deliberate, and he did not allege misconduct or flagrant disregard for judicial process. Subd. 4(a)'s time limit was constitutional as applied to him, because even if the Due Process Clause of Minn. Const. art.

The company filed a petition in the county's trial court for each tax year, and alleged that the property had been unfairly assessed. As part of the petition process, the company was required by Minn. Stat. &sect; 278.05, subd. 6(a) (2008), and Minn.

The documents the company submitted did not include a lease, a rent roll/tenant list for 2008, or a calculation of percentage rent paid. The county moved to dismiss the petitions as providing inadequate information. The trial court agreed with the county.

The doctrine of primary assumption of risk did not apply to preclude respondent's claims that appellant owed a duty of reasonable care in the operation of his snowmobile. Whatever happened in the bean field, appellant did not confront a sudden peril requiring an instinctive reaction. Appellant never saw the drift as hazardous before impact, so any emergency that did occur as a result of his speed was caused by his own driving and thus was not subject to an emergency rule instruction. Further, the record did not support a claim that appellant could have acted differently to avoid the harm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee argued that the WCCA erred in concluding that Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.136, subd. 1b(d), not Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.135, subd. 1, was controlling. The supreme court found that no conflict existed between &sect; 176.135, subd. 1, and &sect; 176.136, subd. 1b(d) with respect to an employer's liability for the amounts charged for treatment furnished by a medical provider located outside of Minnesota. Section 176.136, subd. 1b(d), operated to limit the liability of the employer to pay an out-of-state medical provider in accordance with the workers' compensation fee schedule of that state, and was in harmony with Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.135, subd. 1. Section 176.136, subd. 1b(d) was clear and unambiguous. The employee's argument that she was entitled to more workers' compensation benefits than other Wyoming residents because she would have received those benefits in Minnesota lacked merit. Section 176.136, subd. 1b(d) did not burden the employee's fundamental right to interstate travel. Because Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.136, subd. 1b(d), did not treat similarly situated individuals differently, the employee's equal protection claim failed. Workers' compensation benefits were not vested property interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The first committed person and second committed person were both indeterminately civilly committed to the Minnesota Sex Offender Program. They each sought relief from by filing Minn. R. Civ. P. 60.02 relief-from-judgment motions. After the trial court denied the motions, both of them appealed. The appellate court affirmed the denial of the first committed person's motion upon concluding that he could not use Minn. R. Civ. P. 60.02 to seek a discharge from his indeterminate commitment. It partly did so by finding Minn. R. Civ. P. 60.02 conflicted with the Minnesota Commitment and Treatment Act, Minn. Stat. ch. 253B (2010) (Commitment Act). It also affirmed the denial of the second committed person's motion upon finding that Minn. R. Civ. P. 60.02 could not be used to seek any relief from an indeterminate civil commitment order. The state supreme court found that, as to the second committed person, the appellate court should not have found that the Commitment Act dictated a blanket prohibition on all Minn. R. Civ. P. 60.02 relief-from-judgment motions, as that rule allowed relief regarding very narrow procedural circumstances that did not conflict with the Commitment Act.</SPAN></P>

As a result, it found that the first committed person's claims should be reevaluated and remanded the cases to the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case concerned the aunt's petition for visitation with her niece. The district court had awarded the aunt visitation with the child under Minn. Stat. &sect; 257C.08 (2010) on terms to which the child's father objected. The appellate court reversed and the supreme court affirmed, concluding that the aunt was not entitled to visitation under either &sect; 257C.08 or the common law. The aunt was neither a parent nor a grandparent of the child's mother and therefore, &sect; 257C.08, subd. 1 was not satisfied. Further, &sect; 257C.08, subd. 4 was not satisfied because the aunt did not show that she had established emotional ties creating a parent-child relationship with the child and the child did not reside with the aunt for two years. Because the district court made no findings to suggest that it used more than a mere best interests analysis in deciding to allow the aunt to exercise visitation independent from the grandfather, the district court erred.</SPAN></P>

The legislative districts established in the case satisfied all of the redistricting criteria set forth in the Redistricting Panel's November 4, 2011 order. The legislative districts were not drawn with either the purpose or effect of denying or abridging the voting rights of any United States citizen on account of race, ethnicity, or membership in a language minority group.

The plan therefore maintained five congressional districts composed mainly of metropolitan counties and three districts composed mainly of counties in greater Minnesota.

The physical intrusion of the juvenile's bodily integrity to acquire a DNA sample was minimal, especially when compared to the other intrusions defendant was subjected to as part of her probation, including random urinalysis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the Itasca County District Court (Minnesota) her conviction for drug and child endangerment offenses. Before trial, she moved to suppress evidence seized in a nighttime search. The district court denied the motion, finding that the warrant violated Minn. Stat. &sect; 626.14 (2006), but that it did not require suppression and that the violation was not constitutional. The court of appeals affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It was undisputed that the required grounds for a nighttime search were not established by the police. Thus, the only question on appeal was whether the district court erred when it did not suppress the evidence seized during the admittedly improper nighttime search. If a serious violation occurred that subverted the basic purpose of &sect; 626.14, then the evidence seized during the search needed to be suppressed; but if the violation was merely technical in nature, then suppression was not required. The court defined the interest to be protected by the statute as freedom from intrusion during a period of nighttime repose. The time of the search and the lack of information provided to the court for issuing the warrant represented fundamental departures from the mandate of &sect; 626.14 and constituted serious violations of the basic purpose of the statute. Admitting the evidence would have subverted the purpose of &sect; 626.14. Moreover, the search violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights and the exclusionary rule was applicable. The Fourth Amendment provided a separate and independent basis for suppression of the evidence. The officers could not reasonably have relied on the warrant.</SPAN></P>

The Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court noted that the child pornography statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.247, subd. 4(a), contained an express scienter element. It required proof that a person possessing a pornographic work did so &quot;knowing or with reason to know its content and character.&quot; The supreme court read a prior case to provide an inclusive, not an exclusive, interpretation of &quot;reason to believe.&quot; The words &quot;reason to know&quot; were ambiguous when viewed in the context of the First Amendment requirement that child pornography laws contain a sufficient element of scienter. Under the statute, a possessor of child pornography had &quot;reason to know&quot; that a pornographic work involved a minor where the possessor was subjectively aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the work involved a minor. Because the supreme court could not be certain that the district court's findings of fact and conclusions of law would support defendant's conviction under the narrowing construction of &quot;reason to know,&quot; the district court had to review the record and determine whether defendant was subjectively aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the videos he ordered would involve minors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent Commissioner of Revenue issued relator taxpayer an order assessing income taxes, penalties, and interest for three years that the taxpayer filed no income tax returns. The taxpayer requested reconsideration, and the Commissioner rejected her appeal. The taxpayer again appealed, and, ultimately, the Minnesota Tax Court ordered the taxpayer to pay her income tax for the years in question. The taxpayer sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the taxpayer raised several issues challenging the tax court's order that she pay her income taxes for the years in question. The supreme court found that the tax court's first transfer order referred only to issues of constitutionality, and the district court conferred jurisdiction over the constitutionality of the Minnesota Income Tax Code issues referred by the tax court. The district court order was broad enough to cover the taxpayer's second constitutional claim, even though it arose later. Therefore, the tax court had jurisdiction over all the claims it decided. Further, placing the burden on the taxpayer of establishing the incorrectness or invalidity of an assessment was not unconstitutional. Under Minn. Stat. &sect; 270C.28, subd. 2 (2006), the fact that the Commissioner did not send and the taxpayer did not receive the required notice did not invalidate the assessment. Finally, business records from government agencies that collected information from the taxpayer's employer reflecting her wages were properly admitted as business records under Minn. R. Evid. 803(6). The taxpayer was free to present evidence showing that she received no income, but failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 117.145 (2006). The Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued that Minn. Stat. &sect; 117.145 unambiguously required service on &quot;all respondents&quot; and &quot;all other parties to the proceedings having an interest i any parcel described in the appeal who were shown in the petitioner's affidavit of mailing.&quot; The supreme court found that requiring service of notice of appeal only on parties with an ongoing interest in the parcel subject to appeal would permit the appealing party to unilaterally decide who did or did not have an interest in the property. The statute required service on all respondents and all other parties to the proceedings who were required by Minn. Stat. &sect; 117.115, subd. 2, to have been mailed notice of the commissioners' report. The landowners failed to serve notice of appeal on all parties, and therefore the district court had no subject matter jurisdiction. The landowners would not be denied just compensation even if their appeals were dismissed because they would still receive just compensation as determined by neutral commissioners. The service requirements of Minn. Stat. &sect; 117.145 were not overly burdensome, and they were reasonably calculated to ensure service on all parties with an interest in the appeal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that any error in the use of an anonymous jury did not entitle defendant to a new trial because he failed to offer any evidence to overcome the presumption that actual prejudice did not occur, which arose after the parties were allowed extensive voir dire and were given additional preemptive strikes and the trial court gave appropriate instructions to the jury on the issue of anonymity and the presumption of innocence. The court held that the district court did not err by overruling defendant's Batson challenges to the State's peremptory challenges to two prospective jurors because the State provided race-neutral explanations for both that the district court credited. One juror, who grew up in Somalia and Kenya, was challenged because of his difficulties in understanding and communicating in English. The second juror had stated on his questionnaire that he did not trust law enforcement officials, and after listening to his answers during voir dire the district court was suspicious as to his ability to judge the testimony of a police officer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with second-degree driving while impaired (DWI) based in part on a prior DWI license revocation. Judicial review of the license revocation had been requested, but was stayed. The Court of Appeals of Minnesota reversed a district court holding that the enhancement of the DWI charge based on the unreviewed revocation violated due process. Defendant challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was whether using an unreviewed license revocation as an aggravating factor in a subsequent DWI charge violated due process when the defendant had requested but had not yet received judicial review of that revocation. The lower court erred in faulting defendant for having procured a collateral stay and for not taking action to advance her petition for judicial review where the district court unilaterally imposed the standing order, which made it impossible for defendant to obtain an implied consent hearing within 60 days after filing her petition for judicial review. Defendant sought a stay of the balance of the revocation period, which did not delay or prevent the implied consent hearing. Use of the unreviewed prior license revocation violated defendant's due process rights as her interest in liberty, combined with the risk of erroneous deprivation, outweighed the State's interest in providing enhanced penalties for repeat offenders. The plain language of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.03, subd. 21, required that judicial review be completed before a license revocation under the implied consent law could be used as an aggravating factor in a subsequent DWI prosecution.</SPAN></P>

The husband and wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tort of negligent credentialing was inherent in and the natural extension of well-established common law rights given the appellate court's previous recognition of a hospital's duty of care to protect its patients from harm by third persons and of the analogous tort of negligent hiring, and given the general acceptance in the common law of the tort of negligent selection of an independent contractor. The tort was recognized as a common law tort by a majority of other common law states, relying on various rationales, such as direct or corporate negligence. Although Minn. Stat. &sect; 145.64, subd. 1 (2006) may have made the proof of a common law negligent credentialing claim more complicated, it did not preclude such a claim. Minn. Stat. &sect; 145.63, subd. 1 (2006) did not materially alter the standard of care and although it presented some obstacles in proving and defending a negligent credentialing claim, it also did not preclude such a claim.

Stat. &sect; 169A.53, subd. 3(g) (2006) was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeals (Minnesota) reversed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court held that because the elements of collateral estoppel were not satisfied and public policy weighed against the application of collateral estoppel, Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.53, subd. 3(g) should be allowed to stand as a matter of comity. The elements for collateral estoppel were not satisfied because the State and the Commissioner of Public Safety were not the same party and were not in privity, given that the differing functions and responsibilities of the State and the Commissioner were sufficiently distinct. The State did not have controlling participation in the license revocation hearing, it had no interest in the outcome of the hearing, and it was unable to appeal an adverse ruling against the Commissioner. In addition, the State did not have a full and fair opportunity to be heard on the issue of whether the stop of defendant was lawful as it was relying in good faith on &sect; 169A.53, subd. 3(g) and therefore had no incentive to participate in the implied consent hearing.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 278.05, subd. 6(a), the taxpayer's failure to provide its leases with mall tenants to the county warranted dismissal of its petition. However, the lease provisions contained relevant income and expense information. Specifically, the leases typically contained information relevant to the income approach of real estate appraisal, information which was not contained in the incomes statements and rent rolls provided by the taxpayer. Because leases provide information bearing on income and expense data, the taxpayer could have reasonably anticipated providing leases under the 60-day rule. Further, because the leases at issue contained information about the allocation of expenses between the owner and store tenants, the plain language of the 60-day rule and the court's interpretation of that rule required the taxpayer to produce the leases. Therefore, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator worker challenged a decision of the Minnesota Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals (WCCA), which upheld the Minnesota Department of Labor's denial of his workers' compensation claim alleging that he was permanently and totally disabled as a result of a work-related injury. The WCCA declined to consider the worker's equal protection claim. The worker's petition for further review of the constitutional claim was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court applied rational basis review as the alleged classifications, age and disability, were not suspect classifications and any burden Minn. Stat. 176.101, subd. 5(2) (2006), placed on a worker's right to live where he chose was too attenuated to trigger heightened scrutiny. The classifications applied uniformly to all similarly situated persons as no employee, regardless of how severely his impairment limited his wage-earning capacity, was eligible for permanent total disability (PTD) benefits unless his impairment was among those listed in Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.101, subd. 5(1) (2006). The classifications were necessitated by genuine and substantial distinctions among injured workers where the statute facilitated objectivity by formalizing factors that were implicit in the pre-1995 definition of total and permanently incapacitated. Although the classifications may have been poor determiners of impaired wage-earning capacity, the court could not conclude that the legislature could not reasonably have conceived of any factual basis for conditioning PTD benefits on a combination of age, educational attainment, and permanent partial disability ratings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A purchase agreement for golf course property was contingent on the city amending its comprehensive plan to permit residential development of the property. After the city denied the proposed comprehensive plan amendment, the owner commenced an action against the city, alleging that the denial constituted a taking of the property without just compensation. The district court granted declaratory relief and alternatively a writ of mandamus to the owner. The appellate court reversed. The supreme court found that the denial of the comprehensive plan amendment was not arbitrary or capricious and affirmed on that issue. The city articulated reasons for declining to amend the plan, including the preservation of open and recreational space, and the disruption of surrounding neighborhoods due to increased traffic. The supreme court stated that it could not decide the takings issue under Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 because it was unable to determine whether the denial of the plan left the owner with any reasonable use of the property. Thus, it reversed the appellate court's conclusion on the takings claim and remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for beating the victim, his ex-girlfriend, and breaking her collarbone. On appeal, the court held that the district court erred because the jury instructions failed to inform the jury that defendant had to intentionally inflict bodily harm on the victim, which was an element of &sect; 609.223, subd. 1. By instructing the jury that it was not necessary for the State to prove that defendant intended to inflict substantial bodily harm, the district court gave the jury the opposite impression. The error was plain as intentional infliction of bodily harm was an element of assault and jury instructions were required to include all elements of the offense. The error affected defendant's substantial rights, and therefore reversal was necessary, because it was impossible to determine whether the jury rejected defendant's version of events or whether it accepted his claim that the injury to the victim was accidental but concluded that he was guilty nonetheless because he intended to restrain or tackle the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The signs in question contained a graphic photograph of an aborted fetus and a message that a political candidate was &quot;pro-abortion.&quot; Defendants were prosecuted under the public nuisance statute specifically for endangering the safety of a considerable number of members of the public. The court concluded that none of the evidence presented proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the public was actually endangered, that is, that motorists were unable to safely operate their vehicles due to the signs. It was not enough for the State to cite, as it did, one accident that could not have been caused by the graphic picture of the fetus and then to argue that the picture was so obviously distracting as to require no further proof. Also, the court held that because a materially amended version of the sign ordinance was in effect on the date of defendants' alleged violations, but defendants were charged and convicted under the unamended ordinance, an affirmance of their convictions would have denied them their right to present a defense to the correct ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the parents of two children injured at school during gym class, sued respondent, a school district, alleging negligence. The school district asserted immunity from tort liability under Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.12 (2006). After concluding that &sect; 466.12 did not violate the federal or state constitutions, the Court of Appeals, Minnesota, reversed the trial court, and allowed the school district to assert immunity. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 466.12 required the school district to insure students at a cost of $1.50 or less per year. Because insurance was not available at the statutory rate, the school district requested and obtained certification that the insurance was unobtainable. The statute, however, was no longer in effect, and thus the school district erroneously relied upon it in asserting tort immunity. The statute expired in 1974, and the legislature did not renew it. A repealer, which repealed the statute's expiration provision, Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.12, subd. 4, in 1996, as well as 300 other laws, did not explicitly indicate an intent to revive the statute. The court presumed that when the legislature enacted the repealer, it did so with awareness of Minn. Stat. &sect; 645.36 (1996), and the logical implication that repealing a lapsed expiration provision did not revive the underlying law. Based on this apparent legislative intent, the court held that the repeal of Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.12, subd. 4, which provided for the permanent expiration of Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.12 (2006), on July 1, 1974, did not revive the statute.</SPAN></P>

A divided Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed the MPCA, concluding that the phosphorus discharge would have violated water quality standards, and therefore issuing a permit violated 40 C.F.R. &sect; 122.4(i). The cities and the MPCA petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that MPCA was legally required to enforce and administer 40 C.F.R. &sect; 122.4(i) as its own regulation. Also, 40 C.F.R. &sect; 122.4(i) was ambiguous, and consideration of the MPCA's training and expertise was necessary when the court determined whether the MPCA's interpretation of 40 C.F.R. &sect; 122.4(i) was reasonable. Further, the court concluded that the MPCA's interpretation of 40 C.F.R. &sect; 122.4(i) as allowing offsets from another source in determining whether a new source would cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards was reasonable and was consistent with the purposes and principles of the Clean Water Act. Thus, it was not unreasonable for the MPCA to allow a 2,200-pound per year (at capacity) increase in phosphorus discharge from a new wastewater treatment facility to be offset by a contemporaneous 53,500-pound per year decrease in a nearby facility that was located in the same watershed.</SPAN></P>

Respondent, the children's adoptive, custodial parent, challenged the judgment on appeal, arguing that the statute was unconstitutional on its face and as applied, and that the district court abused its discretion by ordering her to attend counseling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Minn. Stat. &sect; 257C.08, subd. 4 (2006), was facially constitutional because it limited the class of individuals eligible for third-party visitation, prohibited visitation that was not in the children's best interests or interfered with the custodial parent's relationship with them, and was narrowly drawn to the State's compelling interest in protecting the children's welfare by preserving the relationships of recognized family units. The statute was constitutional as applied because visitation was awarded only after the district court found that the third party had lived with the children for over two years, was in loco parentis with them, and that she and the children had a parent-child relationship. Visitation was in the children's best interest, and it did not interfere with the custodial parent's relationship with them. Minn. Stat. &sect; 257C.08, subd. 7 (2006), which placed the burden on the custodial parent to prove that visitation would interfere with her fundamental rights, was stricken. Ordering the custodial parent to counseling without a factual finding that such counseling was in the children's best interests, rather than the custodial parent's, was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The Hennepin County Court, Minnesota, denied defendant's second petition for postconviction relief in which he claimed lack of sufficient notice that he was being charged with committing a murder with a firearm and a Blakely violation. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant challenged the denial of his second petition for postconviction relief, arguing that the State's failure to prove a violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11 (1994), a firearm sentencing statute, violated his rights under Blakely. The supreme court disagreed, finding that all of the claims raised in defendant's second petition were procedurally barred by the Knaffla rule. To the extent that defendant was arguing that &sect; 609.11 should have been charged as an independent crime, his argument was Knaffla-barred because he knew or should have known about this claim prior to his direct appeal. Any Blakely challenge should have been known to defendant at the time of his first petition and could have been raised at that time. Further, neither exception to the Knaffla rule applied because defendant's claims were not novel and the interests of justice did not otherwise require review. Even if defendant's claims were not Knaffla-barred, his claims would have failed on the merits because the presence of &sect; 609.11 in his indictment did not create a jurisdictional issue. Finally, Blakely was inapplicable to collateral attacks on criminal prosecutions.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the verdicts were not final until the jury completed and returned all verdict forms, the verdicts were read in open court, and the jury was polled. There was no implied acquittal, and the conviction was not barred by double jeopardy. The court also found that: (1) a finding of accomplice liability was supported by sufficient evidence, including that defendant helped to move the victim to the place where the victim was stabbed; (2) any error under Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner driver appealed from a district court order sustaining the revocation of his driver's license. The driver argued that because his license was revoked pursuant to a statute that was declared unconstitutional, he was entitled to rescission of his license revocation as a matter of procedural due process. The Court of Appeals (Minnesota) affirmed the revocation of the driver's license. The court granted the driver's petition for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver contended that because his license was revoked under a version of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.53 that the Minnesota Supreme Court declared unconstitutional, the revocation had to be rescinded. Because the court's decision declaring Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.53&nbsp;unconstitutional did not meet the test set forth in Chevron (it merely revived a prior version of the statute), and because the court did not specifically rule that its holding was to be given prospective-only application, Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.53 as it existed immediately prior to the 2003 amendments is properly applied to the driver's case. Also, the driver's right to procedural due process was not violated merely because the hearing on his petition for judicial review was held more than 60 days after he filed his petition. The driver was deprived of his driving privileges for only nine days, and he availed himself of relief by obtaining a stay that allowed him to maintain his driving privileges throughout the process of judicial review. That minimal impact did not outweigh the state's compelling interest in maintaining an administrable system to keep its highways free from impaired drivers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was 15 years old, was tried as an adult and convicted for the murders of two fellow students whom he shot in his high school. After a bifurcated trial at which six expert witnesses testified regarding defendant's mental health, the district court declined to excuse defendant from criminal liability. On appeal, the supreme court affirmed, stating that it would not have served the interests of justice for it to consider striking the long-standing M'Naghten rule, codified at Minn. Stat. &sect; 611.026 (2004), as unconstitutional. The validity of defendant's claim depended entirely on highly technical facts that were never raised before the district court. The supreme court further found that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant a midtrial continuance to procure an expert witness because that expert's testimony would not have materially affected the outcome of defendant's trial with respect to the M'Naghten issue. The imposition of consecutive sentences was appropriate under former Minn. Sentencing Guidelines II.F.2. (2004) because defendant shot two fellow students, one of them at close range, and both students were defenseless.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court determined that Blakely applied retroactively to all cases pending on direct review when it was filed. As such, Blakely did not apply to defendant's collateral attack of his sentence, which was final before Blakely was announced. Defendant was entitled to benefit from Apprendi. Defendant's Apprendi claims were not procedurally barred when raised in his first postconviction petition as he did raise them within the 90 days after denial of his petition for further review by the postconviction petition that he presented pro se. Defendant's enhanced sentence violated due process where he was sentenced to 40 years in prison and the maximum sentence was 30 years.

The lack of more specific warnings as to the consequences of a test-refusal did not violate federal due process, particularly given that Minnesota drivers had a limited right to counsel before testing. The advisory warned that refusal to submit to testing was a crime. Defendants were explicitly warned that test-refusal was a crime.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Former patients assigned claims against defendant insurers to plaintiff chiropractic clinics. The clinics then filed lawsuits against the insurers to recover payment for services rendered to the patients. The cases were consolidated. The Court of Appeals (Minnesota), on remand from the court, had determined that the contracts for service were void as against public policy, and the clinics appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The clinics were owned by an individual who was not a chiropractor; however, the services were rendered by licensed chiropractors. The trial court concluded that because the clinics were being run in violation of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine, contracts under the Minnesota No-Fault Insurance Act service were void. The appellate court reversed, finding that the corporate employment of chiropractors did not violate the corporate practice of medicine doctrine. On appeal, the court held that the corporate practice of medicine doctrine applied to chiropractors and remanded to the appellate court, which held the contracts void. At issue was whether enforcing the contracts would be contrary to public policy based on the fact that the clinics were being operated in violation of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine. In reversing the appellate court, the court held that categorically voiding the contracts would not serve the public policy reasons underlying the corporate practice of medicine doctrine. Nothing suggested an intentional violation of the laws by the clinics; rather, the record showed an obvious intent to try to comply with Minnesota law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate appealed a decision of the Goodhue County Court (Minnesota), which denied her request to vacate her sentence but ordered a sentencing hearing under Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.10, subd. 5(a) (2005). The inmate was convicted of, among other crimes, first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and the trial court sentenced the inmate to 264 months in prison, a 120-month upward departure from the 144-month presumptive sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate argued that the retrospective use of a sentencing jury under Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.10, subd. 5(a) (2005) and Minn. Sent. Guidelines II.D (2005) violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. V and the Ex Post Facto Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court found that the double jeopardy argument failed because the inmate failed to show that the proposed resentencing hearing would be a second prosecution. The county court's adoption of the aggravating factors under a lesser standard of proof was not equivalent to an acquittal on the aggravating factors for double jeopardy purposes and the evidence was not insufficient to prove the factors. The amended provisions affected the identity of the fact finder. The retrospective application of the 2005 amendments to Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.10, subd. 5(a) (2005) was not prohibited as an ex post facto law because the change was procedural; it inured to the inmate's advantage, who was on notice of the criminality of her conduct and its potential punishment. The allowance for sentencing juries did not punish as a crime a previously innocent act or make more burdensome the punishment or deprive the inmate of any defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Minnesota), which affirmed his conviction of felony theft by swindle, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.52, subds. 2(4), 3(3)(a) (2004). On appeal, defendant challenged the district court's double upward durational departure from the presumptive guideline sentence. He argued, in part, that the district court did not have authority to impanel a jury to make findings on aggravating sentencing factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint was silent about aggravating factors. Before trial, the State served notice that it would seek an enhanced sentence under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 4 (2004) and Minn. Sentencing Guidelines II.D.2b.(1). The State did not amend its complaint to reflect those aggravating factors. The State later withdrew its motion for an upward departure based on &sect; 609.1095. Following the guilt phase of the trial, the district court reconvened the jury for a finding on the remaining aggravating factor, victim vulnerability. On review, the court first held that the district court had inherent power to impanel a sentencing jury and that the authority was not precluded by case law or by reasons of comity to the legislature. The court next determined that the aggravating factor of victim vulnerability did not have to have been alleged in the complaint. In addition, the procedures utilized by the district court were in material compliance with the procedures later authorized by Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.10 (2004 &amp; Supp. 2005) for resentencing. Finally, the court noted that even if the failure to include the vulnerable victim sentencing factor in the complaint was error, it was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended her sentence violated Blakely and the trial court abused its discretion in imposing an upward durational departure. The State argued that defendant's appeal was time-barred as she failed to meet the time requirements of Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.11, subd. 3 (2004). The supreme court agreed that &sect; 244.11, subd. 3 applied as defendant did not meet the statute's 90-day requirement after pronouncement of sentence but held that the statute violated the separation of powers under Minn. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 by encroaching on the supreme court's appellate jurisdiction and its inherent authority over matters of appellate procedure. As such, defendant's appeal was properly before the supreme court. However, as defendant's conviction was not on &quot;direct review&quot; at the time Blakely was decided, Blakely did not apply retroactively to defendant's sentence. Further, the imposition of an upward durational departure sentence was appropriate because at least two aggravating factors existed: (1) the victim was treated with particular cruelty because he was left, severely injured, in a secluded location by a swamp, and (2) three people were involved in the kidnapping.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a guilty plea, defendant received a 72-month upward departure from the presumptive sentence based on statements given at a plea hearing. While defendant's case was pending on appeal, the decision in Blakely was rendered. The court of appeals then reversed defendant's sentence after finding that the upward sentencing departure was unconstitutional. The State then sought review. In affirming, the supreme court held that defendant was required to expressly, knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive his right to a jury determination of facts supporting an upward sentencing departure before his statements at his guilty-plea hearing could have been used to enhance his sentence. Defendant's waiver of his right to a jury trial on the issue of guilt was not a waiver of his right to a jury determination of aggravating sentencing factors. Further, his statements to police could not have been used to enhance the sentence either because they were not made for purposes of dispensing with the State's burden of proof after a knowing waiver of jury-trial rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court determined that defendant had a custody-status point because he was on probation when he committed the current offense, and as a result, defendant's presumptive sentence was 42 months, stayed. Based on defendant's numerous prior alcohol-related convictions and his history of absconding from probation, the district court found that defendant was not amenable to probation and sentenced him to an executed 42-month prison term. The appellate court ruled that when the district court found that defendant was unamenable to probation, and on that basis executed his presumptively stayed sentence, it violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to have a jury make that determination using a reasonable-doubt standard. Because Minn. Sentencing Guidelines II.D authorized the district court to make such an unconstitutional upward dispositional departure upon finding an aggravating factor without the aid of a jury, that provision was unconstitutional as applied. Also, the district court assigning defendant a custody-status point to calculate his criminal history score did not violate the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent was a player for the football club and had suffered heat-related problems in previous training camps. He had some problems the first day of camp and collapsed the second day. He got up and walked to the medical trailer, but continued having problems and subsequently became unconscious. Neither his blood pressure nor his temperature were taken. The decedent died at the hospital of a heat stroke. The court of appeals held that respondents' actions were not grossly negligent as a matter of law. The court affirmed, and it held that when determining coemployee immunity, the course and scope of employment should have the same meaning as the course and scope of employment test used to determine whether an employee qualified for workers' compensation benefits. The court held that respondents' obligations to the decedent directly resulted from their employment with the football club and the club's efforts to provide a safe workplace for their players. Because respondents were acting within the course and scope of their employment, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on the issue of whether respondents had a personal duty to the decedent.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the district court found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had a loaded handgun in his possession at the time he possessed the controlled substance. Based on the latter factor, the district court imposed an upward durational departure. The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed. The State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court sentenced defendant to 36 months in prison under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11 (2004), which provided for a mandatory minimum sentence of 36 months after a judicial finding of firearm possession during the commission of a predicate offense. The court of appeals reversed the sentence as violating defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial based on Blakely v. Washington. The State sought further review, arguing that sentencing under the statute was advisory. In the alternative, the State argued that defendant's sworn admissions at his sentencing hearing satisfied the &quot;Blakely admission exception.&quot; The Minnesota Supreme Court held: (1) Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11 (2004) was not merely advisory, and it was unconstitutional because it authorized upward durational departures from the presumptive guideline sentence upon finding an aggravating factor without the aid of a jury; and (2) where a defendant requested and was denied a jury determination of a fact necessary to enhance the sentence beyond the range of the presumptive guideline sentence, any statements a defendant made subsequent to that denial could not be considered for the purposes of the Blakely admissions exception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The first issue was whether the trial court erred by instructing the jury that the loss of a tooth was a permanent loss of the function of a bodily member. Defendant argued that the instruction was improper because it effectively constituted a directed verdict for the prosecution on the element of great bodily harm. The court of appeals held that even if the instruction was error, it was harmless. The supreme court held that instructing the jury that the loss of a tooth was the permanent loss of the function of a bodily member, in effect, instructed the jury that the definition of &quot;great bodily harm&quot; was established. Thus, the instruction removed from consideration by the jury the question of whether the loss of a tooth constituted &quot;great bodily harm,&quot; violating the requirement that criminal convictions had to rest on a jury determination that defendant was guilty of every element of the crime with which he was charged, beyond a reasonable doubt. The instruction was erroneous and because it deprived defendant of the right to have the jury determine that every element of the charged offense had been established, the harmless error analysis was not applicable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent corporation sought tax refunds. Relator Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue denied both a fees subtraction and deductions. The Minnesota Tax Court ruled that the corporation's foreign subsidiary could qualify as both a foreign sales corporation (FSC) and a foreign operating corporation (FOC). The fees subtraction was allowed, but a dividend-received deduction was denied. The parties cross-petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation claimed the refund as a result of relations with its foreign subsidiary. The refund claims were based on: (1) a subtraction, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.01, subd. 19d(11) (1998), in calculating its net income of royalties, fees, or other income accrued or received by the corporation from the subsidiary; and (2) a deduction, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.21, subd. 4(a)(1) (2004), from the corporation's taxable net income for 80 percent of dividends deemed paid by the subsidiary. To preserve the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.21, subd. 4(e) (2004) under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, and to avoid discrimination, the supreme court construed the statute so that the denial of the dividend-received deduction applied to dividends actually paid by FSCs, but not to dividends deemed paid for FSCs that were FOCs. The subsidiary qualified as a FSC, as well as a FOC under Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.01, subd. 6b. The tax court did err in its conclusion that federal law governed which fees were subject to the fees subtraction. State law provided that a FOC could subtract fees, and the tax court properly found that these fees were paid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the district court committed reversible error when it sustained the State's Batson objection to the peremptory challenge of a veniremember. The supreme court agreed. The district court addressed only the first part of the pretext analysis, the relevance of the race-neutral reason given by defendant that the veniremember was not credible. The district court determined that that reason was not relevant or valid because it believed that the veniremember was credible. But after the district court rejected defendant's race-neutral reason, it was left with no reason for the strike; it did not identify any circumstance that would supply the required inference that the real reason was racial discrimination. In fact, the district court never made a finding that the peremptory challenge was based on race. The only finding was that defendant's stated reason for the strike was not &quot;sufficient.&quot; The district court as the fact-finder at step three of the Batson analysis did not announce a finding that defendant had a discriminatory motive to strike the veniremember because his accomplice was to be a State's witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county held a prescriptive easement over the company's property where a golf culvert was located. The snowmobiler's snowmobile struck the culvert's side wall. He was thrown from the snowmobile and injured. The trial court rejected appellants' arguments that the 10-year statute of repose in &sect; 541.051, subd. 1(a), for improvements to real property barred the snowmobiler's action. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that appellants had an ongoing duty under common law to use reasonable care for the safety of entrants on their land, including the duty to inspect their premises for dangerous conditions and to repair them or warn entrants about them. The court determined that the statute of repose did not bar the snowmobiler's claim because. under the plain language of &sect; 541.051, subd. 1(c), owners or other persons in possession retained their ordinary landowner liability for negligent maintenance, operation, and inspection of real property improvements. The court also concluded that owners and possessors were not denied equal protection of the law if they were held liable for their common-law duties to inspect and maintain their real property improvements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The voter claimed that the candidate should be removed from the ballot or not designated as the incumbent because he was improperly appointed by the governor to fill a vacancy without meeting residency requirements under a newly adopted redistricting plan and that he therefore did not qualify for the residency requirement exception provided for incumbents in Minn. Stat. &sect; 480A.02, subd. 3. The court held that redistricting orders had consistently been held to apply to future elections and did not change the boundaries with regard to incumbents; thus, the candidate's appointment was properly based on the old district, rather than the new redistricting plan, and he satisfied the residency requirement at the time of his appointment. The court held that the voter's claims of violations of the Guaranty Clause of the United States Constitution were political questions that were not justiciable controversies. The court concluded that Minn. Stat. &sect; 480A.02, subd. 3 (2002), was a permissible exercise of the legislature's authority under Minn. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the St. Louis County District Court (Minnesota) that convicted him of first-degree felony murder, in violation of Minn.

P. 26.02, subd. 6a(3)(a); thus it was not clear error for the trial court to overrule his peremptory challenge objection, which was based upon an alleged &quot;pattern&quot; of the State's exclusion of jurors that had not been established. The court rejected defendant's claim that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.05 and its associated jury instructions impermissibly alleviated the State's burden of proof because &sect; 609.05 did not permit a conviction without the requisite mental state. The court held the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions where it showed that he drove to an acquaintance's apartment with friends and a gun, intending to rob a drug dealer who had previously sold him fake drugs, and that the drug dealer was then shot and killed by one of defendant's friends, who also shot the acquaintance.</SPAN></P>

R. Civ. P. 12.02. The appellate court concluded that the energy company suffered a real, substantial loss and lacked an adequate legal remedy, as the poles and tracks for the transit line were in place. The supreme court granted appellants' petition for review and reversed. Viewed in the light most favorable to the energy company, the record did not establish that the placement of the train tracks, the operation of trains on those tracks, or the construction of the overhead lines would physically prevent the energy company from placing its cranes on the street for purposes of removing a failed transformer. While the dismissal was improper under Minn. R. Civ. P. 12.02, because the trial court considered an affidavit, it was appropriate under Minn. R. Civ. P. 56.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer and respondent insurer accepted liability for the injury, but a dispute arose over the nature, extent, and duration of the claimant's injury and disability. Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the claimant's union and the employer, the disputes were to be resolved through an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) system under Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.1812 (2002). A doctor, through a dispute resolution examination, found that the claimant had not sustained any significant work injury. After hiring an attorney, an arbitrator determined that the claimant's work injury was temporary and that the claimant had not sustained a psychological injury. The WCCA rejected challenges to the ADR system, but agreed that the arbitrator misconstrued the Minnesota Workers' Compensation Fund rules. The court held that a claim alleging state law substantive rights that applied without regard to the CBA was not preempted by 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 185(a).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant stabbed his pregnant girlfriend, resulting in her death. Investigators questioned defendant through an interpreter. Defendant admitted that he had stabbed his girlfriend, that he had choked and slapped her in the past, and that she had been afraid of him. The court concluded that the choking and slapping incidents, with other evidence of pervasive abuse, adequately demonstrated a past pattern of abuse. Hence, sufficient evidence supported the domestic abuse conviction under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.185(a)(6) (2002). The trial court adequately instructed the jury that more than one act was required in order to find a past pattern of domestic abuse. Although the interpreter made some translation errors, those errors were not significant enough to deny defendant his right to a fair trial. Moreover, defendant was not entitled to suppression of his statements because of the interpreter's failure to take an oath pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 611.33, subd. 2 (2002), because the interpreter was not certified, or because the statements were not transcribed into Spanish.

Applying Minn. Stat. &sect; 148.10, subd. 1(a)(11) and (e), the board concluded that using &quot;runners&quot; or &quot;cappers&quot; to solicit patients negatively affected the professional-patient/client relationship and was unethical, deceptive, and harmful to the public and, thus, constituted unprofessional conduct. It appeared that the board was treating the use of &quot;runners&quot; or &quot;cappers&quot; to obtain business as unprofessional conduct per se. However, there was no evidence in the record of an industry standard indicating that the use of &quot;runners&quot; or &quot;cappers&quot; to solicit patients was per se unprofessional.

Stat. &sect; 550.37, subd. 24, exempt funds in an Individual Retirement Account or Individual Retirement Annuity, each as defined in I.R.C. &sect; 408, whether or not the debtor had unlimited access to the account balance?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The debtor filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and owned a &quot;qualified individual retirement annuity&quot; (IRA), on which the return varied with the performance of the underlying stock and bond investments. The IRA satisfied the requirements of I.R.C. &sect; 408(b) as an individual retirement annuity. The debtor claimed in his bankruptcy petition that the IRA was exempt from his bankruptcy estate under Minn. Stat. &sect; 550.37, subd. 24, and the trustee objected to the claimed exemption. The bankruptcy court disallowed the exemption, concluding that the IRA was not exempt property. The reviewing court held that an IRA, as defined by I.R.C. &sect; 408, was exempt property under Minn. Stat. &sect; 550.37, subd. 24, as limited by the terms of Minn. Stat. &sect; 550.37, subd. 24(a), to an indexed present value and sums reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and the debtor's spouse or dependents. The Minnesota Legislature clearly intended that IRAs generally be exempt by expressly listing them, in contrast to 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 522(d)(10)(E), which did not mention them by name.</SPAN></P>

The print media challenged the closed meetings, and obtained an order compelling disclosure of the data generated. The court held that the Open Meeting Law and the Data Practices Act applied to the Regents' presidential search process. The candidates that were interviewed by the Regents were &quot;finalists&quot; as contemplated by the Data Practices Act, and particular information about them was subject to public disclosure. The fact that the University was not specifically mentioned by the Data Practices Act did not exempt it from coverage. The Regents were a &quot;public body&quot; within the terms of the Open Meeting Law. The court acknowledged the unique constitutional situation of the University pursuant to Minn. Const. of 1857, art. VIII, &sect; 4, but subjecting the University to the requirements of the Open Meeting Law and the Data Practices Act did not violate the constitutional autonomy afforded to the University for its core functions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The convictions arose out of defendant's conduct and subsequent arrest by a tribal officer on the White Earth Reservation. The officer was enforcing Minnesota criminal statutes on the reservation under an agreement entered into between the White Earth Band of Chippewa Indians (the Band) and Becker County, Minnesota. Defendant argued that the cooperative agreement between the Band and County did not give the officer authority to effectuate a valid arrest of a Band member on the Reservation because the State of Minnesota had not properly retroceded its jurisdiction to the federal government and therefore the State retained exclusive jurisdiction over criminal matters. The Supreme Court of Minnesota found that the Band fulfilled all of the statutory requirements of Minn. Stat. &sect; 626.93 (2002) to authorize it to exercise concurrent law enforcement authority with the County. The cooperative agreement gave concurrent powers of arrest and law enforcement to state-licensed tribal police officers, and the State, through the County, retained jurisdiction to charge and prosecute individuals alleged to have engaged in criminal conduct, as defined under Minnesota Statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals of Minnesota, which reversed defendant's conviction for the misdemeanor domestic assault of his wife. The reversal was based on the trial court's ruling, prior to trial, that the State could admit evidence under Minn. Stat. &sect; 634.20 (2002) that defendant had previously assaulted his wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court held that evidence of prior similar conduct had to first be established by clear and convincing evidence to be admitted at trial. In reversing, the court found that no evidence of the alleged prior domestic assault was ever admitted. The court expressly adopted &sect; 634.20 as a rule of evidence for the admission of evidence of similar conduct by an accused against an alleged victim of domestic abuse and held that such evidence could be admitted under &sect; 634.20 without being established by clear and convincing evidence. Section 634.20 did not violate the separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary by conflicting with Minn. R. Evid. 404(b). Although Rule 404(b)'s heightened evidentiary standard served the important purpose of helping ensure that defendant was not unfairly prejudiced, the standard did not implicate a fundamental right. The trial court's ruling allowing the admission of evidence of the alleged prior assault allowed the State to present evidence that, if believed by the jury, could have assisted the jury by providing a context with which it could better judge the credibility of the principals in the relationship.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers owned and operated supply vending machines.

The taxpayers filed a declaratory action against the Department, the Commissioner, and the State seeking a judgment that the taxation of food sales from vending machines was unconstitutional. After summary judgment was granted in favor of the State, the taxpayers sought review. In affirming, the court noted that the sale of prepared food and sales of food through vending machines were taxed under Minn. Stat. &sect; 297A.61, subd. 3(d) (2002). This was a change from prior taxation schemes. The court held that the new method of taxation did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 or Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1, which both provided the same scope of protection. The disparate tax treatment of similar prepackaged food items based on whether the item was purchased from a vending machine or a convenience store did not constitute an arbitrary classification. The court found that the method-of-merchandising and consumer-market tests still applied. Further, absolute equality and uniformity in taxation were not required.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that a case was pending until such time as the availability of direct appeal had been exhausted, the time for petition for certiorari had elapsed, or a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court had been filed and finally denied. Because the court found that the inmate's case was pending when the new federal rule was announced, which provided that any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum had to be submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the inmate was entitled to the benefit from the rule and a new sentence.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed, concluding that there was a rational connection between the goal of protecting children from drugs and deterring the possession of drugs in a school zone, as there was a genuine risk that those involved in illegal drug use, whether selling or merely possessing a controlled substance, could bring the dangers associated with illegal drugs into school zones. As such, &sect; 152.023, subd. 2 (4), as applied to the present facts, did not violate the guaranty of equal protection contained in the Minnesota Constitution.

But, the decision to prescribe rules allowing a broad array of courses that could qualify for elimination of bias credit was made after taking into consideration concerns by members of the bar who cautioned against having a limited view of what constituted bias. The elimination of bias requirement did not violate the attorney's First Amendment right to freedom of speech. When meeting the elimination of bias requirement, the Minnesota Board of Continuing Legal Education's approval of certain courses that included a discussion of religion in the context of eliminating bias in the legal profession and in the practice of law did not violate the Establishment Clause or Minn.

Upon notification of her obligation to pay, respondent declined representation, claiming that she could not afford the co-payment. Later, respondent determined that she needed the assistance of counsel and paid the co-payment. Respondent challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 611.17, subd. 1(c), arguing that it violated her right to counsel under the Minnesota and United States Constitutions. The trial court found the statute unconstitutional. On review, the supreme court held that respondent met the heavy burden of showing that &sect; 611.17, subd. 1(c) was unconstitutional.

The instant court disagreed with the WCCA. An assessment of fees under Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.191 did not preclude an additional award of fees pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.081, subd. 7.

The second conviction, a &quot;first-degree&quot; conviction, constituted a designated offense which qualified defendant's vehicle for forfeiture.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court had held that, due to defendant's financial condition, any forfeiture of her vehicle exceeding $ 1,000 would violate the Excessive Fines Clauses of the United States and Minnesota Constitutions. It ordered the City to sell defendant's vehicle, waive any storage fees, keep $ 1,000, and remit all remaining funds back to defendant. The state's highest court held that the district court abused its discretion in finding that a forfeiture of more than $ 1,000 was a violation of the United States or Minnesota Constitutions. Defendant's forfeiture was not disproportionate to other forfeitures in Minnesota and was subjected to heightened protections of a criminal trial. Further, many other states, in addition to Minnesota, subject a person's vehicle to forfeiture when such person has been convicted of several impaired driving offenses. Therefore, the forfeiture of defendant's vehicle was not grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense and did not violate the Excessive Fines Clauses of the Minnesota or United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Over defense objection, a special investigator was permitted to testify as an expert about gangs and gang affiliation. Although affirming the conviction, the court held that the admission was error. To be admissible, the testimony had to be helpful to the jury when making its factual determinations under &sect; 609.229, subd. 2, including whether the group was a criminal gang, whether defendant was a member, and whether a crime was committed for the benefit of the gang. The court concluded that much of the testimony was not helpful, but, rather, to the extent relevant, was largely duplicative. Testimony from witnesses with first-hand knowledge included that defendant was associated with the group; that the group's primary activity was a profitable drug trafficking operation; and that the group had a gang name, used gang terms, and flashed gang signs. This first-hand-knowledge testimony was how the State should have gone about proving the elements of the crime. The court commented that the allegation of gang affiliation ought not serve as a justification for extensive expert testimony regarding criminal gangs. However, because the testimony was duplicative, the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court concluded that the case consisted of two legal issues: (1) whether there was a stop; and (2) did the game officer (officer) have the authority to inspect defendant's boat once it had been established that defendant had been fishing and was transporting fish. The officer walking up to defendant and conversing with him while his boat rested on the trailer of a parked portage truck did not amount to a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes. In this case, no search occurred. Rather, the officer issued a ticket for refusing to allow an inspection of the motorboat used to transport wild game fish. Thus, the appellate court had to determine whether a nonconsensual search of the boat, being used to take or transport game fish in the field, could have occurred within the limits imposed by the Fourth Amendment. As the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy, it was permissible for the officer to conduct a lawful nonconsensual inspection of the areas of defendant's open boat typically used to store or transport fish. By refusing to submit to the officer's lawful request to inspect these areas of his open boat, defendant violated Minn. Stat. &sect; 97A.251, subd. 1(3).</SPAN></P>

The evidence had limited probative value and served no purpose other than to attempt to persuade the jury that the mother was in some way responsible for the victim's death merely because she was not an ideal mother. Defendant also sought to admit evidence relating to a cigarette burn the victim's sister allegedly suffered which he claimed was the mother's fault. Beyond the allegation that the mother was responsible for the cigarette burn, the record was devoid of any evidence as to who was to blame for the cigarette burn. Mere allegations without additional proof could not satisfy the clear and convincing requirement of the reverse-Spreigl test. Therefore, the evidence was properly excluded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A St. Louis County (Minnesota) jury convicted defendant of first-degree felony murder and attempted first-degree murder with a judicial officer presiding over most of the pretrial proceedings, as well as all aspects of the trial, including sentencing. Defendant asserted on appeal that the judicial officer did not have jurisdiction to hear and try cases of first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was assigned to a judicial officer rather than a district court judge, and neither party objected. In reversing the conviction, the court concluded that the legislature intended Minn. Stat. &sect; 487.08, subd. 5 to give the chief judge of a judicial district authority to assign any district court matter to a judicial officer. That grant, however, violated Minn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1, as it ran afoul of the constitutional mandate that judicial officers be inferior in jurisdiction to the district court. If judicial officers were allowed to preside over one of the weightiest matters within the district court's jurisdiction -- a first-degree murder trial -- then there was no effective limit to the judicial officer's jurisdiction. Although defendant did not raise the issue of the judicial officer's authority until his appeal, the court could not discount the constitutional defect in the authority of the judicial officer simply because defendant failed to raise the issue at trial. Accordingly, defendant was entitled to a new trial before a district court judge. The court limited application of the holding to pending and future cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee association owned four buildings in a district that was designated a historic district by appellant City. By writ of certiorari, the association challenged the City's designation, claiming that it acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably. The Court of Appeals of Minnesota granted relief to the association and reversed the City's designation of the northeast portion of the district as historic. The City appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City claimed the court of appeals substantially departed from the usual course of justice in its standard of review of quasi-judicial decisions. First, the Supreme Court of Minnesota held that Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances &sect; 599.210 (2001) did not limit properties to those with historical significance. The central question was whether the City acted arbitrarily or capriciously in designating a portion of the district as historic. Because the City made contemporaneous findings to support its decision, the association bore the burden of proving that the City acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably. The supreme court concluded that the City did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in designating the district as historic. The court's decision was constrained by the significant deference it accorded the quasi-judicial actions of local governments and the broad and subjective criteria for historic designation set out in the ordinance. The historic designation met the criteria in the ordinance, as the City made findings in favor of its decision that were supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court convicted defendant of driving after revocation and no driver's license in possession and held that while Minn. Stat. &sect; 168.0422 (2002) was unconstitutional, that defendant's vehicle's WZ series plate justified the stop. The Minnesota Court of Appeals held that by displaying the plates issued pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 168.041, subd. 6, defendant implicitly consented to a vehicle stop. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A deputy testified that the only reason defendant was stopped was that his vehicle had special series registration plates issued when the previous plates were impounded because the operator of the vehicle was driving under the influence. There were no indicators that defendant had been consuming alcohol. On review, the court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 168.0422 (2002), which authorized stops of drivers based solely on the special series registration plates, sought to dispense with the individualized suspicion requirement and was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court disagreed with the State's argument that by applying for and receiving the special series plates, defendant destroyed any reasonable expectation of privacy. The special series plates were sometimes issued where someone other than the violator would be lawfully driving the vehicle. Thus, Minn. Stat. &sect; 168.0422 subjected licensed motorists to the possibility of being stopped. The presence of special series plates issued pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 168.041, subd. 6 or Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.60, subd. 13, did not amount to a reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity .</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the court of appeals decision and vacated defendant's convictions as the product of an unlawful seizure. The court limited the retroactive application of its ruling to cases pending on the date of the decision in which the constitutionality of the statute was properly raised in a timely fashion.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. Defendant was aware and suspicious of his wife's relationship with the victim and had shown anger and jealously over their relationship in his comments to his wife's brother and through notes and e-mails sent to his wife. Defendant's actions of driving 15 miles late at night, going around the block a second time to avoid being seen, sneaking into the house through a window, taking a loaded rifle with him, and taking off his shoes so he would not be heard all showed planning and preparation and not heat of passion. Moreover, given that defendant strongly suspected that there was a relationship between his wife and the victim and that the victim was at the house with his wife, hearing his wife giggle and finding them together was not sufficient provocation to justify a heat of passion killing. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to have determined that defendant killed the victim with premeditation and without heat of passion.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the corporation argued that the fund family should not have been considered the consumer under Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.191, subd. 5(j) (1988), as it was only a conduit of the benefits of those services to the fund investors, who were located across the nation. The appellate court found that the fund family was not merely a conduit of the corporation. The fund family had a legal obligation to provide services to investors and served its own needs when it contracted to have that obligation performed on its behalf by the corporation. Thus, the fund family was the consumer of the benefits of the services of the corporation, and the fees received by the corporation for those services were appropriately attributed for tax purposes to Minnesota, as the home state of the fund family.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the State argued that entry into fish houses fell within an exception to the constitutional protections from search because it was an administrative inspection in a closely regulated industry. The appellate court held that defendant, as an occupant of a fish house, was entitled to the protections against unreasonable search and seizure afforded by the federal and state constitutions, and these protections had to be read into the &quot;at all reasonable times&quot; language of Minn.

The district court sentenced defendant pursuant to the crime committed for the benefit of a gang statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.229 (2000), and the court of appeals affirmed. The supreme court held that: (1) the district court did not err by finding that Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator taxpayers challenged respondent Commissioner of Revenue's decision to disallow charitable contributions that the taxpayers made to a Massachusetts donor-advised charitable gift fund. The Minnesota Tax Court determined that taxpayers' contributions did not qualify for a deduction because they were neither made to qualifying Minnesota charities nor made in trust for qualifying Minnesota charities. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers established a donor-advised charitable gift fund account in Massachusetts and made significant charitable contributions to that fund between 1994 and 1996. The taxpayers deducted those contributions from there alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) for purposes of their Minnesota state income tax. The state supreme court affirmed the tax court's determination that as the taxpayers' contributions were not &quot;to&quot; or &quot;in trust for&quot; Minnesota charitable organizations, they did not qualify for an alternative minimum tax deduction. The state supreme court did hold however, that Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.091, subd. 2(f) was unconstitutional in that it violated the Commerce Clause as the statute allowed for a deduction for contributions to Minnesota charities, but did not allow a deduction for contribution to non-Minnesota charities. The appellate court severed the language the &quot;Minnesota charitable contribution deduction&quot; from section 290.091, subd. 2(a)(2). The result was that Minnesota AMTI now consisted of, among other things, the itemized deductions allowed in computing the federal AMTI, including deductions for contributions to Minnesota charities and non-Minnesota charities.</SPAN></P>

The district court dismissed the clergy malpractice, emotional distress, and fiduciary duty claims, but concluded that its jurisdiction over the negligence claim was not prohibited by the prohibition on excessive government entanglement with religion in the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or Minnesota's prohibition on alienation-of-affection claims. The court of appeals reversed, holding that resolution of the negligent-counseling claim unconstitutionally entangled the district court in religious doctrine, practice, or church polity.

The supreme court found that the trial court's findings and conclusions did not clearly reflect a proper incorporation of the parental presumption into the trial court's analysis. While the trial court correctly acknowledged that the welfare of the child was paramount, it appeared to have elevated tallies of the best interests factors to a degree suggesting that the sheer number of such factors, without more, could mathematically erase the presumption favoring a parent and constituted extraordinary circumstances justifying the custody award. The supreme court concluded that although the trial court correctly considered the best interest factors, it erred in granting custody to the mother's sister and brother-in-law by not making a finding on whether extraordinary circumstances of a grave and weighty nature existed to justify denying custody to the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended on appeal that it was an abuse of discretion to dismiss without an evidentiary hearing his claim regarding the unreliability of the DNA evidence used to convict him. The State argued that defendant's DNA claims failed to satisfy the requirement that &quot;newly discovered evidence&quot; be used to grant a new trial only if the evidence would probably produce either an acquittal at a retrial or a result more favorable to defendant. The Supreme Court of Minnesota held that the DNA claims were or could have been raised on direct appeal, and thus that there was no abuse of discretion in denying defendant relief. In any event, the supreme court could not reexamined the issue substantively as defendant had failed to satisfy his burden of providing the court with evidence that would warrant reopening his case. Defendant also challenged the statute under which he was convicted, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.185(2) (1990), arguing that it was constitutionally defective in that it did not require a finding of intent to cause death.

Furthermore, the wife provided information regarding defendant's shotgun purchase, verified by authorities through store records.

The distribution replaced lost revenue. Municipalities, school districts, and counties within the TTRA received a portion of the tax. The legislature established several organizations and funds to rehabilitate areas adversely affected by the mining industry, to foster economic growth, and to diversify the region's economy, and allocated part of the taconite production tax to these organizations and funds. Where the taconite production tax was distributed among the communities of the TTRA and that revenue sharing spurred more commercial-industrial growth in some communities than in others, it was reasonable for the legislature to direct that a portion of the increase in commercial-industrial property tax base generated by that growth be shared among the communities within the TTRA.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant was convicted and sentenced for obstructing legal process with force or violence, a gross misdemeanor. On appeal, the defendant contended that the jury instructions for obstruction failed to adequately distinguish between legal behavior and illegal behavior. The Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the defendant argued, inter alia, that the district court failed to instruct the jury that the obstruction of justice statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. 609.50, subd. 1(1), (2) (2000), prohibited only words or acts that physically obstruct an officer, in accordance with prior case law. In light of the evidence presented and all of the jury instructions given, the appellate court held that the district court erred when it failed to instruct the jury on the elements of obstruction of legal process in accordance with prior case law. However, the court concluded that there was no reasonable likelihood that a more accurate instruction would have changed the outcome in this case. In order to find the defendant guilty of gross misdemeanor obstruction of legal process, the jury was required by their answer to the special verdict question to find that the defendant's act was accompanied by force or violence or a threat of force or violence. The jury also found him guilty of disorderly conduct after being instructed that if the defendant's conduct consisted only of offensive, obscene or abusive language, the words used had to have been fighting words.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sentencing court, based upon its review of a court-ordered psychological and psychosexual evaluation, found that defendant qualified as a patterned sex offender, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.108 (2000); defendant's crime was motivated by sexual impulses and were apart of a predatory pattern of behavior; he was a significant danger to the public; he needed long-term treatment or supervision beyond the presumptive term of imprisonment and supervised release; and the record was filled with aggravating circumstances. The appellate court determined that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.108, subd. 2 authorized the sentencing court to impose an enhanced sentence, but required that all such findings be made by a jury based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The supreme court upheld the appellate ruling and found that due process required that each of these findings, sexual motivation, etc., be made by a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The relator worker filed a claim for workers' compensation after he was injured while working for the respondent non-profit employer. The claim was denied and the denial was affirmed. The Minnesota Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of the award and the worker appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The worker was receiving welfare benefits. He was injured while participating in a community work experience program (CWEP). The worker argued that he should be able to maintain an action for workers' compensation benefits because the Injury Protection Program (IPP) was not his exclusive remedy. The supreme court disagreed. The purpose of the IPP was to provide an adequate remedy for injured CWEP participants who by definition were low-income persons participating in work requirements to avoid welfare sanction and were not earning wages. To that end the IPP provided payment for medical expenses associated with injury in a simple and straightforward manner, with a minimum of bureaucratic hassle or need for the participant to seek legal representation or engage in an investigation of the claim. The worker's request for compensation of hypothetical future wage loss was more appropriately addressed to the legislature, as it had no bearing on the question of whether a program designed to compensate non-wage-earners for injury was meeting those needs. Therefore, workers' compensation benefits were properly denied.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals (Minnesota) affirmed the district courts' findings that respondents could recover in equity because there were no statutory or constitutional remedies available.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wrong class rate was applied to the taxpayers' properties, and the taxpayers overpaid their taxes. The period within which to file a Minn. Stat. ch. 278 petition passed before the taxpayers filed for a refund. The lower courts erroneously concluded that the application of an erroneous class rate was not an aspect of the assessment process. The taxpayers could have brought a claim under Minn. Stat. &sect; 278.01, subd. 1. The taxpayers were not provided an alternative remedy. The taxpayers' constitutional rights to due process and equal protection were not violated. There was no evidence that the assessors intentionally or arbitrarily applied the reduced rate to some eligible properties but not to others. The taxpayers did not have an independent cause of action under Minn. Stat. &sect; 276.19. Having failed to avail themselves of adequate statutory remedies, the taxpayers could not recover their property tax overpayments in common law or equity.</SPAN></P>
