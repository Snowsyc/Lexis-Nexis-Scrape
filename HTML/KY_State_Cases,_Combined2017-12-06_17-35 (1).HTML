</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant doctor appeals from an order of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) dismissing her petition for judicial review of an adverse determination of appellee Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure. At issue before the court was whether the circuit court correctly dismissed the doctor's petition because it had not been filed within the 30 days prescribed by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 311.593 and 13B.140(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board issued a complaint and emergency order of suspension against the doctor based on criminal accusations against her. Because the doctor had not practiced in more than two years during the pendency of that matter, the Board issued another order requiring her to complete a clinical skills assessment pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 311.604. The doctor did not schedule the assessment as ordered, and the Board issued an order of suspension, noting that the doctor had thirty days to appeal the order. She failed to file a petition for judicial review until nearly 18 months later. On appeal, the court determined that the delay was fatal to the doctor's appeal. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 311.593 and 13B.140, when read together, imposed a 30-day period of limitations for an aggrieved party to challenge a final order of the Board regarding a disciplinary action. The circuit court correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the doctor's petition for judicial review because the petition had not been timely filed. Although the order of suspension did not directly refer to itself as a &quot;final and appealable order,&quot; it was clearly intended to act as such.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, sought review of a judgment of the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) denying its motion to dismiss on the grounds that sovereign immunity barred a Declaratory Judgment Act, Ky. Rev. Stat. ch. 418, action against it. The action was filed by appellee members of the County Employees Retirement Systems (CERS). Appellee Kentucky Retirement Systems also tendered an appellee brief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At issue was whether sovereign immunity served as a bar to declaratory judgment actions that were not seeking monetary recompense but were challenging the constitutionality of a statute, as were the members; specifically, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 61.637(17). The Retirement Systems advocated that the Attorney General should defend the action, not it. The court determined that the Retirement Systems was a &quot;person&quot; pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 418.085 since corporations qualified as a &quot;person.&quot; In addition, the court was unpersuaded by the argument that the Attorney General was in a better position than the Retirement Systems defend challenges to the constitutionality of statutes. The court then noted that it was convoluted reasoning to suggest that the Attorney General was protected by sovereign immunity under the declaratory judgment act, but the Retirement Systems was not. Both the Retirement Systems and the Attorney General were parts of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth had the prerogative to opt out of defending the action but it could not then also claim sovereign immunity. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a wrongful death action, defendant appealed the judgment of the Fayette Circuit Court (Kentucky), arguing that the action was barred by the one-year statute of limitations under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.140 and that the punitive damage award was constitutionally excessive in that it violated his federal due process protections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was charged with murder for the intentional killing of the decedent, plaintiff, the decedent's father, filed a wrongful death action. After defendant pled guilty to the lesser offense of manslaughter, plaintiff moved for summary judgment in the wrongful death action. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff on the issue of liability, and trial proceeded on the issue of damages. The jury awarded $3.3 million in compensatory damages and $60 million in punitive damages. On review, the court held that, because it had previously decided that plaintiff's claim was not barred by the statute of limitations, the law of the case doctrine applied and precluded the court from reviewing the issue again. However, the purpose of the punitive damage award was not to compensate the estate but to vindicate the state's legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence of conduct of the type in which defendant engaged. Under that analysis, the $ 60 million punitive award was grossly excessive; as such, it was violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">That portion of the trial court's judgment awarding $60,000,000 in punitive damages was reversed, and the case was remanded with directions to reduce the award to the constitutionally acceptable amount of $ 30 million, which represented a single-digit ratio of 9 to 1. While on the high end of single-digit ratios, such a punitive damage award was constitutionally permissible given the reprehensibility of defendant's murderous conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Henderson Circuit Court (Kentucky), which upheld his conviction for violating a city ordinance by willfully failing to file an occupational license return under City of Henderson Ordinance &sect; 21-33.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the ordinance as applied deprived him of due process of law. He claimed that the trial court erred in failing to declare the ordinance unconstitutional, if not on its face, then at least as applied to him. Defendant argued that the City's failure to appoint a Board of Occupational License Appeals as described in the ordinance violated due process by depriving citizens of an administrative vehicle by which they could challenge their claim or assessment as to whether or not a return was due or a tax owed. Thus, defendant contended that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied because it failed to offer him a pre-deprivation hearing, which would have been a meaningful opportunity either to contest the ordinance's requirements or to withhold a contested tax assessment. The court agreed with defendant. On paper, the ordinance provided defendant a fair opportunity to challenge his obligations, but the City never established the Board of Occupational License Appeals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the anonymous tip lacked the predictive quality required by the court's jurisprudence and that reliance on a tip which lacked sufficiently predictive information cannot be corroborated and therefore, was lacking as a basis for probable cause to seize his property. The Commonwealth argued that given the totality of the circumstances, the trial court was correct in denying defendant's motion. The Commonwealth justified the seizure of defendant's vehicle by claiming that there was probable cause to believe that a weapon would be found in the car and that if the car had not been impounded on the spot, the evidence would probably have been lost or destroyed. The court agreed with defendant and overruled the decision because an informant's tip lacked information that was adequately predictive. The tip also could have been corroborated to justify impounding the vehicle. Defendant's movement across the center console did not corroborate any aspect of the anonymous tip and certainly did not give rise to suspicion that evidence of a crime would be found anywhere in the car other than the area within his immediate control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It was alleged that a bartender at the owner's facility served a patron a large amount of drinks within a short period of time. The patron had an accident that killed the decedent. The trial court found that the decedent's estate was unable to recover punitive damages from the bar owner. This appeal followed. In reversing, the appellate court determined that the prior interpretations of the Kentucky Dram Shop Act in Jackson v. Tullar were consistent with the clear language of the statute relating to the recovery of punitive damages. However, the Act's implicit prohibition on recovery of punitive damages violated the jural rights doctrine under Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 14, 54, 241 and separation-of-powers doctrine under Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 27, 28, 109. Therefore, the Act was unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibited recovery of punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants challenged an order of the Fayette Circuit Court (Kentucky), which denied their motion to suppress evidence obtained during a vehicular stop. Appellants alleged that the police stop of their vehicle was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Ky. Const. &sect; 10 because it was based upon an anonymous tip without any corroborating evidence of wrongdoing or any indicia of reliability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants were observed by a motorist swerving on the road. He called the police and told them where the appellants were located, but did not give his name. When the officer arrived, a person in another vehicle pointed to appellants. The officer stopped and searched appellants. They were ultimately arrested. Appellants filed motions to suppress, contending the stop of their vehicle was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Ky. Const. &sect; 10. They argued the tip came from an anonymous person. The Commonwealth alleged this was an identifiable informant or a citizen informant case. The court reversed. It ruled the tip was from an anonymous informant and did not carry sufficient indicia of reliability because it consisted of information readily available to a casual bystander. The officer testified he saw a man in a van pointing to appellants' vehicle and he did not have a conversation with him; thus, the tip was not from an identifiable citizen informant. The officer did not personally observe any illegal activity by appellants to corroborate the tipster's story. Given the totality of the circumstances, there was insufficient reliability to justify stopping appellants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order denying appellants' motion to suppress. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Kentucky Executive Branch Ethics Commission, sought review of an opinion and order of the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky), which granted a motion for summary judgment filed by appellees, current and former property valuation administrators (PVAs) in their declaratory judgment action and which enjoined the Commission to dismiss administrative charges against the PVAs for alleged violations of the Executive Branch Code of Ethics.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11A.080(1)(a), the Commission investigated the alleged violation of the Executive Branch Code of Ethics by the PVAs and found probable cause to believe a violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11A.020(1)(c) had occurred in the PVAs' hiring of family members. The trial court concluded that the Code of Ethics did not apply to the PVAs. It held that since the PVAs did not fall within the definition of &quot;officer&quot; or &quot;public servant&quot; under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11A.010(7) and (9), they were local officials and the Commission lacked jurisdiction to bring administrative charges against them. On appeal, the court disagreed. It determined that there was evidence that the PVAs were major management personnel in the executive branch of state government and thus were &quot;officers&quot; subject to the Executive Branch Code of Ethics. When the trial court resolved the case on statutory grounds, the Commission's claim that the PVAs' declaratory judgment action was premature for failure to exhaust administrative remedies became moot. However, the court's decision that the statutes were misapplied meant that the PVAs did have to exhaust their administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and remanded with directions for the trial court to dismiss the case and lift its order holding the administrative proceedings in abeyance so that the PVAs could exhaust their administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On remand from a prior appeal, the Workers' Compensation Board (Kentucky) affirmed a judgment for appellee employer, denying appellant coal miner's claim for benefits for black lung disease. It found that the miner failed to overcome the presumption in the consensus classification statute,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. 342.316(13). The miner appealed, arguing that the burden placed upon him under &sect; 342.316 was a violation of his right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The miner's expert reported that the miner suffered from pneumoconiosis. The employer's expert submitted his own report that the miner did not. Pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316(13), the miner's x-rays were submitted to a panel of experts for a consensus decision. Two of the three believed he did not suffer for pneumoconiosis. Because the miner did not submit clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, as required under &sect; 342.316(13), the administrative law judge determined that he did not qualify for workers' compensation benefits. The Board agreed. However, the reviewing court reversed, finding that &sect; 342.316(13) impermissibly violated the miner's right to equal protection. Coal miner cases were treated differently with no substantial or justifiable reason for the disparate treatment of similarly situated compensable illnesses.  There simply was no substantial nor justifiable reason to treat workers who contracted pneumoconiosis from coal mining differently from those who contracted pneumoconiosis due to the inhaling of other particulates. The burden that it established for those who made a claim was, therefore, a violation of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Franklin Circuit Court, Kentucky, granted summary judgment declaring that appellant employers, members of the workers' compensation self-insurance group, were jointly and severally liable for all claims against the fund.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employers argued that the enactment of S.B. 86 impaired vested rights and defenses and it constituted special legislation prohibited by the Kentucky Constitution because the employers were the only entity affected by the governor's ratified Executive Order and by the statute's retroactive application. The appellate court found that the language of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 304.50-005 clearly defined the class as required and provided that it was applicable to all members of the class. There were distinctive and natural reasons supporting the classification, which was met by the nature of self-insured groups, the similarity of such groups and the legitimate legislative interest in regulating the risks and liabilities of injured employees and their members. There was no indicating that S.B. 86 would apply only to the group if there were other workers' compensation self-insured groups. Application of S.B. 86 was not unconstitutional, special, or retroactive legislation. The circuit court had jurisdiction over the rehabilitation and sufficient notice was given. There was no breach of the indemnity agreement which would allow the employers to rescind the joint and several provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Jefferson Circuit Court, Kentucky, granted judgment in favor of appellee shareholder, individually and on behalf of appellee corporation, on her derivative claims for breach of fiduciary duty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The director argued that the shareholder failed to satisfy the demand requirement of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 271B.7-400(2), because she alleged claims in her verified complaint that were not included in her demand letter. The appellate court concluded that the shareholder failed to make a sufficient demand for action as contemplated by the statute. The demand letter dated May 16, 2001, simply requested production of certain information and demanded an investigation into her particular allegations. She at no time demanded the commencement of legal action. The trial court did not err by concluding that the shareholder fairly and adequately represented the interests of the shareholders as she was the only shareholder available to pursue claims on behalf of the other shareholders. The shareholder failed to demonstrate a specific injury to herself outside the diminution in value of company stock and she did not sufficiently allege a cause of action under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 271B.8-300. The shareholder's proceeding was not wholly without merit, and the trial court erred in awarding the director attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed in favor of the shareholder individually and remanded with instructions to dismiss her direct action claim; the judgment was reversed as to the award of attorney fees to the director and remanded for further proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employee, a coal miner, sought review of an opinion and order of the Kentucky Workers' Compensation Board (Board), affirming the dismissal of his claim against appellee employer by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). The employee contended that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316, which defined the procedure for coal workers' pneumoconiosis claims (CWP), was unconstitutional in violation of his right to equal protection under the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Attached to the employee's CWP claim application, as required by &sect; 342.316(3)(a)(1), was an x-ray interpretation, indicating that the employee was positive for CWP. The employer countered with its own x-ray interpretation. According to the statute, because the interpretations differed, an x-ray was sent to a three-person panel for a consensus, with the panel's classification of the CWP presumed to be the correct classification of the employee's condition unless overcome by clear and convincing evidence. On appeal, the court agreed with the employee that the statute unconstitutionally violated his equal protection rights as a coal miner who suffered from pneumoconiosis by imposing more stringent procedural and substantive law requirements on coal worker claimants than on other pneumoconiosis claimants. There was no rational basis for disparate treatment of industrial workers with the same occupational disease based on nothing more than the industry in which the disease was contracted. Accordingly, &sect; 342.316 was unconstitutional insofar as it required the three-member consensus panel and imposed a higher burden of proof upon CWP claimants than on other pneumoconiosis claimants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded the cause for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After his motion to suppress evidence was denied, defendant entered a conditional guilty plea in the Fayette Circuit Court (Kentucky) to first-degree trafficking in a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, and operating on a suspended or revoked license. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress because the search of his vehicle was illegal under U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court of appeals agreed. The officer conducted a traffic stop of defendant's vehicle for failing to use his blinker when he turned left in a left-turn-only lane. Upon checking defendant's license, it was discovered that defendant was driving on a suspended license. The officer placed defendant under arrest for that offense. When defendant was being removed from his vehicle, two additional officers arrived. While the officer placed defendant in the cruiser, the two other officers began a search of defendant's vehicle. The parties agreed that defendant was secured in the back of the officer's vehicle during the vehicle search. The search revealed three bags of cocaine and a set of digital scales found underneath the backseat. The officer testified at the suppression hearing that his only reason for stopping defendant was the commission of a minor traffic offense. He further stated that during the arrest there was nothing in plain view that generated a suspicion that defendant might have drugs or paraphernalia in the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was vacated and the case was remanded to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pro se defendant appealed from an order of the Hardin Circuit Court (Kentucky), directing that $ 2,175 forfeited to the Commonwealth not be returned to him. Defendant argued that the currency was not connected to any criminal activity for which he was convicted and should have been returned to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">There was sufficient evidence to warrant forfeiture of the money under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.410(1)(j). The money was found in close proximity to the drugs. Defendant's recorded confession included a denial that he smoked crack cocaine but made money from it. Defendant was found with one large bag of cocaine in one pants pocket and several small &quot;packaged&quot; baggies in the other pocket. Given the evidence of traceability, the burden of proof then shifted to defendant, forcing him to rebut the presumption, by clear and convincing evidence, that the money was not involved in drug related activity. The only evidence he presented was his self-serving testimony that he won it gambling. He claimed he had a casino receipt on him at the time of his arrest, but he did not produce it at trial or the forfeiture hearing. The forfeiture was not excessive when compared to other cases involving the forfeiture of property. Also notable was the fact that defendant could have been fined between $ 1,000 and $ 10,000 due to his being convicted of a felony under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 534.030(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant former husband filed a petition for dissolution of his marriage to appellee former wife. The Jefferson Circuit Court Family Court Division (Kentucky) dissolved the marriage but reserved other issues for future adjudication. The parties then agreed to binding arbitration. The family court signed the arbitration award without independent review. Both parties appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The arbitration order required the family court to enter the arbitrator's award as a judgment of the family court without independent judicial review or without an opportunity for either party to submit objections to the family court. In a case of first impression in Kentucky, the court concluded on appeal that the family court improperly delegated its constitutional duties, including its decision-making authority, to an arbitrator in contravention of Ky. Const. &sect; 109 and in circumvention of the legislative intent regarding the duties of family court judges. Because of the Commonwealth's compelling interests in the area of domestic relations and the family court's unique protective role in this area of the law, especially in the establishment of family courts through constitutional amendment, a domestic relations proceeding was not an arbitratable controversy within the meaning of the Uniform Arbitration Act, codified as Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 417. Under Ky. R. Civ. P. 52.01 and Jefferson Fam. Ct. R. Prac. 702, the family court was required to hold a hearing upon all pending matters and to make independent findings of fact and conclusions of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Energy and Environment Cabinet (Cabinet), sought review of two orders of the Clay Circuit Court (Kentucky) declaring void the Cabinet's final orders entered against appellees, an individual property owner and a coal company. The Cabinet had imposed civil penalties on the owner for violating the provisions of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 350 et seq., and its related regulations pertaining to surface coal mining.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Cabinet sent the owner notices of assessments on a preprinted form that did not advise the owner of his right to seek a waiver of the requirement that he prepay the proposed penalties if he wanted to request a formal hearing. The owner never responded and then sought judicial relief. The circuit court declared the orders void. On appeal, the court overturned the Cabinet's orders on different grounds. In Franklin, the Supreme Court of Kentucky held that the Cabinet's prepayment provisions imposed prior to the granting of a formal hearing were unauthorized by statute and unconstitutional. Despite this ruling and subsequent legislative and administrative changes in response to Franklin, the form notice here advised the owner that he was not entitled to an administrative hearing absent prepayment of the proposed penalty. An agency was without authority to issue an order in direct contradiction of Kentucky's statutes and judicial decisions. This was particularly true where the agency misinformed a citizen regarding a constitutional right to which he was entitled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the circuit court's opinion and orders and remanded the case to the Cabinet with directions that the owner be granted the opportunity to request a formal hearing accompanied by a proper request for a waiver from the prepayment provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (Cabinet), sought review of an order of the Scott Circuit Court, Family Division (Kentucky) (Scott Family Court) finding it in contempt for failing to pay child care assistance costs to appellees, an uncle who agreed to take permanent custody of a child who was his niece. The uncle resided in Scott County and the child's mother resided in Jefferson County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Jefferson Family Court granted permanent custody of the child to the uncle and his partner. Although it was not in the order, the uncle claimed that the Cabinet agreed to pay for child care assistance costs. At the uncle's request, the Jefferson Family Court transferred the action to Scott County. Despite having transferred the action, the Jefferson Family Court ordered the Cabinet to provide assistance. The uncle returned to the Scott Family Court to enforce the Jefferson Family Court's order. The court held that the Scott Family Court abused its discretion in holding the Cabinet in contempt for failing to comply with the Jefferson Family Court's order because the Jefferson Family Court lost jurisdiction over the matter once it was transferred to the Scott Family Court pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 452.010(1). Thus, the Jefferson Family Court's order was void ab initio. Further, the Scott Family Court abused its discretion in denying the Cabinet's Ky. R. Civ. P. 59.05 motion to alter, amend, or vacate its previous orders mandating payment of child care costs because the law of the case doctrine did not apply and it did not consider Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 610.010(12).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the order of the Scott Family Court and remanded the case with instructions for the Scott Family Court to disregard the invalid order entered by the Jefferson Family Court and to reconsider the Cabinet's Ky. R. Civ. P. 59.05 59.05 motion in light of the appellate opinion, including but not limited to a consideration of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 610.010(12) and its applicability to the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a negligence and false imprisonment action resulting from a hoax perpetrated against managers and employees of a fast-food restaurant, defendant restaurant corporation appealed a judgment of the Bullitt Circuit Court (Kentucky) that awarded compensatory and punitive damages under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.184 to plaintiff, a former employee who was sexually assaulted as a result of the hoax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As a result of a hoax telephone call by someone representing himself to be a police officer, the employee was falsely accused of theft, threatened, subjected to strip and body cavity searches, and held against her will in a room with several men, one of whom sexually assaulted her. On review, the court that the evidence supported the employee's false imprisonment claim because she was deprived of her clothing, repeatedly objected to the search of her body, was threatened with further police involvement, was held in a locked room, and had a constant guard between herself and the door. The evidence further supported the employee's negligence claim because the evidence showed that the restaurant corporation was aware of the hoax, that the hoax had been perpetrated at another of its restaurants, and that its management team made a conscious decision not to tell restaurant managers of the hoax or to provide training or instruction to prevent the hoax from successfully occurring again. The award of punitive damages was not unreasonable because the jury found that the restaurant corporation owed a duty to train, supervise, or warn about the hoax calls and that it failed in that duty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment in favor of the restaurant's former employee was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mechanical contractor appealed the summary judgment entered in the Franklin Circuit Court, Kentucky, upholding the constitutionality of portions of Ky. Rev. Stat. ch. 337 and assessing back wages and civil penalties against the contractor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The contractor provided services on public works projects that were awarded based on payment of the prevailing wage pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 337 (the Act). Appellee, the Kentucky Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet, audited the wage records and notified the contractor that it had underpaid several of its employees. It was ordered to pay $ 51,620 in back wages. The contractor filed a complaint asking the court to declare various portions of the Act unconstitutional. While the review process set forth in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 337.520 through 522 was related to setting the prevailing wage and not to the classification of employees or to enforcement of the Act, the Act did provide a process for aggrieved parties to be heard by filing a civil action. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky upheld the trial court's finding that the Act was constitutional. The Cabinet was not exercising judicial authority when it issued its citation and sought to collect back wages. The trial court used the incorrect standard of review in finding for the Cabinet on its counterclaims. The audit forms submitted by the Cabinet were inadmissible hearsay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's finding that the Act was constitutional was affirmed; however, the appellate court vacated and remanded the trial court's finding for the Cabinet on its cross-claims. On remand, the trial court was directed to evaluate the evidence presented de novo without deferring to the Cabinet as to its findings or its method of classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Franklin Circuit Court, Kentucky, reversed the order of the Kentucky Board of Tax Appeals (Board), holding that appellee corporations were not subject to Kentucky corporation income tax but were subject to tax on their distributive share income from partnerships, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 141.206. Appellant Finance and Administration Cabinet, Department of Revenue (Cabinet) appealed; the corporations cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporations argued that the circuit court erred by finding that they were subject to taxation pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 141.206(5). The appellate court found that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 141.206(5) subjected the corporations to taxation. The statute was not void for vagueness, i.e., unintelligibility. While the corporations did no business in Kentucky, at various times they owned up to a 99% limited and/or general partnership interest in, and have received distributive shares of partnership income from the profits of, a partnership which did business in Kentucky. As such, this provided the requisite link for taxation under the Commerce Clause and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 141.206(5), the legislature intended for the amount of tax owed to be calculated using the formula found therein. This would not result in extraterritorial values being taxed. The corporations were not entitled to immediate payment of any refund, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 131.365, 134.580. The challenged portions of the house and senate bills were not impermissible special legislation in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 59 with respect to regulating the rate of interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed to the extent that the corporations had a tax nexus with Kentucky; the judgment was reversed insofar as the apportionment method applied and the order of an immediate refund in favor of the corporations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a wrongful death action, defendant fuel transport company appealed a judgment of the Knott Circuit Court (Kentucky) in favor of plaintiff, the estate of a decedent who died in an accident caused by the transport company's alleged negligence, arguing that the trial court erred in denying its motion for a new trial on the basis of juror misconduct and that the imposition of punitive damages was improper without a showing of gross negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver of a coal truck entered the wrong lane and overcorrected, causing his rig to overturn. Moments later, the vehicle in which the decedent was a passenger crashed into the coal debris, and the decedent sustained fatal injuries. On review, the court held that the trial court did not err in declining to grant a new trial because a juror did not conceal that her father had been killed in an automobile accident. Although defense counsel asked jurors if they had ever been involved in a traffic accident, the jurors were not asked if any family members had been involved in such an accident; as such, defense counsel failed to ask questions that would have elicited the information they claimed the juror withheld. However, the trial court erred in denying a directed verdict on the punitive damages claim. Punitive damages under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.184 were only proper in cases of gross negligence. Although the fuel transport company's driver failed to exercise reasonable care, his actions did not rise to the level of wanton or reckless disregard for others. An award of punitive damages under the circumstances would eliminate the distinction between ordinary and gross negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case was remanded with instructions to vacate that portion of the judgment awarding punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

Over thirty years later, appellant filed a complaint for his interest in his father's property. The circuit court dismissed the complaint, because judicial precedents holding Ky. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a district court judge, sought review of a decision of the Jefferson Circuit Court, (Kentucky), which granted a writ of prohibition against the judge. The controversy involved a verbal and written prohibition, promulgated by the judge, that prohibited a county attorney and his assistants from making objections during a preliminary probable cause hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judge issued an order precluding county attorneys from posing objections to questions at future preliminary hearings on several listed grounds. The circuit court issued a writ of prohibition against the judge. The court held that a requirement that a writ of prohibition against a district court be filed in a circuit court was not without reason and was in conformance with the provisions set forth in Ky. R. Civ. P. 81, Ky. Sup. Ct. R. 1.040(6), and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23A.080(2). The court rejected the judge's argument that the Kentucky Supreme Court was the only court that could impose a prohibition. Further, the county attorney had standing to commence the action. The court agreed with the lower court that the extraordinary relief afforded by a writ was warranted because the judge's directive prevented county attorneys from advocating on behalf of the Commonwealth, resulting in an irreparable injury without an adequate remedy for appeal. Although the judge had potential grounds for sanctioning the individual attorney, he could not issue a verbal and written directive stifling the ability of all county attorneys to ask questions of defense witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a school district, board of education, and superintendent, filed a petition for a declaration of rights contesting the constitutionality of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 160.350(2). They challenged a judgment of the Campbell Circuit Court (Kentucky), which granted appellee Commonwealth's motion to dismiss and upheld the statute as constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school district entered into a contract with the superintendent, who was an Ohio resident. The Kentucky Office of Education Accountability issued an investigative report stating that the superintendent violated &sect; 160.350(2) because he was not a Kentucky resident. The court of appeals held that requiring the superintendent to reside in Kentucky after he was appointed was not an improper restraint upon his right to travel and migrate under Ky. Const. &sect; 24 and the United States Constitution. Section 160.350(2) imposed a permissible residency requirement. There was no requirement that a candidate for superintendent had to have been a Kentucky resident for a certain number of years. Instead, Kentucky residency was imposed as a condition of employment that could occur after hiring. The statute did not deny the superintendent equal protection of the law. The Commonwealth's argument that a Kentucky resident would have a better comprehension of Kentucky's educational needs was a rational basis for Kentucky's requirement that superintendents live in Kentucky.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 403.750(2) did not require proof of additional acts of violence. A hearing was not required before an extension of a DVO was ordered. If a hearing was required, the process articulated in &sect; 403.750(2) for extending a DVO would be rendered useless, as the process would be the same as the process for originally granting a DVO. The husband failed to notify the Kentucky Attorney General during the pendency of the case before the trial court and therefore his constitutional claims were not preserved for review under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 418.075. The trial court was familiar with the details of the case, as she had followed it through district and circuit court. Further, the trial court considered the dismissed criminal charges, appellee wife's affidavit, and the fact that the wife was only asking for a one-year extension of the DVO. The trial court properly considered the circumstances surrounding the original issuance of the DVO and the effectiveness of the DVO in preventing any violence between the parties, which fully satisfied the purpose of Kentucky's domestic violence and abuse policy under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 403.715(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commonwealth challenged an order of the McCracken Circuit Court (Kentucky), which dismissed the charges against defendant for violating Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section &sect; 150.740 banned the importation of the members of the animal family Cervidae in the Commonwealth. Defendant had purchased elk, deer, antelope, and exotic sheep in Missouri and was enroute travelling through Kentucky to a lodge in Tennessee that had purchased the animals. The court of appeals held that the trial court properly determined that &sect; 150.740 was unconstitutional as applied in the case as being void for vagueness. It was reasonable to believe that defendant drove through Kentucky in good faith. He had no notice that merely driving through Kentucky with the deer and elk was a felony. The statute did not define the word &quot;importation.&quot; The definitions of &quot;import&quot; connoted a business interest underlying the activity of bringing in particular goods. Merely transporting an item through an area was not the same as importing it. It would be reasonable for defendant to have believed that as long as he did not unload cervids in Kentucky, he would not be importing them. The statute did not provide any limitation on the common meaning of importation.  There was no administrative regulation construing the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charges against defendant arose from four conversations he had on the internet and telephone with an undercover police detective posing as a fourteen-year-old girl.

Defendant entered a conditional guilty plea to four counts of violating Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 510.155, which prohibited the use of electronic means to induce a minor to engage in sexual activities. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky held that the protection against double jeopardy was not violated. Each count of the indictment referred to conduct which would constitute a separate violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 510.155. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky also held that the peace officer provision of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;  510.155 did not violate the First Amendment, because defendant believed that he was soliciting a child to engage in sexual activities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) ruled that the severability clause in an ordinance banning smoking in certain places was invalid, and therefore struck the ordinance in its entirety due to an unconstitutional provision exempting a racetrack. Appellant county metro council sought review; appellees, a corporation and a limited liability company, moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the trial court entered judgment, the council amended and re-enacted the ordinance, deleting the exemption for the racetrack. Appellees argued that as a justiciable controversy no longer existed, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction. The appellate court disagreed. A justiciable controversy existed because appellees sought relief beyond the racetrack's exemption and because there were pending actionable citations under the former ordinance. The trial court invalidated the entire ordinance, despite a severability clause that complied with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 446.090, based upon its finding that the council would not have passed the ordinance without the exemption for the racetrack. In doing so, it erred by reviewing the legislative history without first finding that any portion of the ordinance was ambiguous. With the deletion of the racetrack exemption, the ordinance could still fully serve its purpose of promoting the public's health. The ordinance was not inseparably connected and dependent upon the racetrack exemption such that was is apparent that the council would not have enacted it in the absence of the exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was pulled over for driving without his headlights illuminated, the police officer noticed that he had a strong odor of alcohol about his person. The officer administered several field sobriety tests to defendant, which defendant failed, as well as a preliminary breath test (PBT). Although he admitted that the PBT results were inadmissible under &sect; 189A.104(2), defendant moved for leave to present them as exculpatory evidence. The appellate court found that defendant did not refuse to submit to one of the tests found in &sect; 189A.104(1) nor was he subject to any enhancement of penalties. Consequently, the statute and its prohibition regarding the admissibility of PBT results did not apply. Furthermore, because the statute was inapplicable to defendant's case, the question of its constitutionality was a moot issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father's wife was the daughter of the maternal grandmother.

The appellate court found that (1) even though the father's woefully deficient appellate brief could have been stricken for noncompliance with Ky. R. Civ.

HONORABLE ELEANORE GARBER, JUDGE. ACTION NO. 03-AD-500471. APPEAL FROM JEFFERSON FAMILY COURT. HONORABLE ELEANORE GARBER, JUDGE. ACTION NO. 01-FC-005806.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In companion cases, appellant biological parent appealed a decision by the Jefferson Family Court, Kentucky, refusing to set aside, under Ky. R. Civ. P. 60.02, an adoption decree and a joint custody order relating to her biological child. Appellee, the biological parent's same-sex life partner, argued that the adoption was permitted as a &quot;stepparent-like&quot; adoption under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 199.470(4)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When granting the life partner's adoption petition, the family court accepted the parties' agreement that the adoption would not terminate the biological parent's rights. On appeal, the court held that the life partner was not the child's stepparent because same-sex marriages were void as against public policy, and &quot;stepparent-like&quot; adoptions were not recognized in Kentucky. The family court's creation of the legal fiction that the life partner was a stepparent was an invalid attempt to avoid Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 199.520(2), 402.020(1)(d), 402.040(2), and Ky. Const. &sect; 233a. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 199.520(2), requiring termination of ties between biological parents and children upon adoption, was not subject to waiver by agreement. The adoption was also invalid because the Kentucky Cabinet of Families and Children refused to consent as required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 199.510(1). Despite its procedural irregularities, the adoption decree was not attackable because Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 199.540(2)'s one-year annulment period had passed, but the custody order was attackable under Ky. R. Civ. P. 60.02 because the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to grant the adoption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court affirmed the family court's order overruling the biological parent's motion to set aside the adoption decree rendered in favor of the life partner. The court reversed the family court's order overruling the biological parent's motion to set aside the joint child custody order and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

At trial, appellants demanded a jury trial on all issues. The trial court announced, on its own initiative, that it would conduct a bench trial on all issues except damages. Appellants argued to the appellate court that the trial court erred in holding a bench trial. The appellate court noted that Ky. R. Civ. P. 38.01 provided that a party could demand a jury trial and that such demand could not be withdrawn without the consent of the parties. The court concluded that the trial court erred in denying appellants the right to a trial by jury. Moreover, as there was no dispute that appellants neither withdrew their demand, nor consented to the bench trial by written or oral stipulation, the appellate court found that they did not waive their constitutional right to a jury trial on all issues pursuant to Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant spouse, individually and as administratrix of a decedent's estate (administratrix), appealed an order of the Anderson Circuit Court (Kentucky) dismissing her claims against appellees, a paramedic and an emergency medical technician (EMT). The paramedics cross-appealed the decision not to additionally dismiss the administratrix's claims pursuant to the doctrine of release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court held that the paramedics were not subject to the Good Samaritan immunity under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 411.148 and 311A.150. Section 411.148 did not apply to the regular professional work responsibilities of paramedics for which they were paid. The paramedics provided care to the decedent in the normal course of their work. They had a duty to assist the decedent. Care or treatment for remuneration or due to a pre-existing duty was specifically exempted from the immunity granted by &sect; 411.148. The purpose of &sect; 411.148 was to encourage the rendering of medical assistance to those in need by trained medical personnel by removing the fear of liability that accompanied rendering aid under the common law. The adoption of &sect; 411.148 was within the legislature's police powers, and did not violate the jural rights doctrine under Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 14, 54, and 241. The refusal to dismiss the suit under the release doctrine was proper as there were fact issues as to what was stated by paramedics about the decedent's condition. Whether the spouse would have signed the release depended on the version of the facts that was correct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court for proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants home buyers sued appellees, the seller, a real estate agent, the agent's agency, and the agency's owner, in the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) for fraudulent inducement. The trial court granted appellees' motion to require arbitration, and an arbitrator awarded the buyers less damages than they sought.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The buyers said Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 417, on arbitration, was unconstitutional under the Kentucky Constitution. The appellate court held it had no authority to accept their claim that a Kentucky Supreme Court decision was wrongly decided. Chapter 417 did not violate their Ky. Const. &sect; 7 right to a jury trial because that section contemplated exceptions to the right, and Ky. Const. &sect; 250, allowing the creation of an arbitration system, was such an exception. Chapter 417 did not violate the separation of powers doctrine in Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 27 and 28 because Ky. Const. &sect; 250 gave the legislature the power to establish an arbitration system. The standard for finding if a party was bound by an arbitration agreement was not that applied to a waiver of constitutional rights in a criminal case but, once a proper arbitration agreement was shown, required one opposing arbitration to rebut a statutory presumption of its validity. Chapter 417 did not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 2 by failing to provide meaningful judicial review of arbitration because Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 417.160 and 417.170 provided such review. The level of judicial review was consistent with the purposes of arbitration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that &sect; 189A.010(2), which applied to test results taken over two hours after cessation of operation or physical control of a motor vehicle, violated the Kentucky Constitution's principle of separation of powers.

Her test result was obtained well within the two-hour limit that was set forth as an element of the offense in &sect; 189A.010(1)(a). Because the test result was within that time period, &sect; 189A.010(2) had no relevance or application to her case. She therefore could not have suffered any injury or harm from it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee, the Kentucky Board of Tax Appeals denied appellant taxpayer's tax refund claims against appellees, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the city, the county, and various government agencies, for certain tax years. The Board also denied the taxpayer's request for relief from additional tax assessments. The Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) affirmed the Board's order. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board found that the taxpayer, a domestic life insurance company, was at fault for failing to report the underlying details of its separate accounts account and for failing to include applicable items in its Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 136.320 filings. The primary issues were (1) whether the value of the taxpayer's investment corporate stock was erroneously treated in the computation of the taxpayer's tax liability under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 136.320 for certain years, and (2) whether assets booked as separate accounts were properly subjected to taxation during certain years. On appeal, the court found that the computation method used followed the procedures in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 136.020. Moreover, the taxpayer reported the grand total of the separate accounts account in its filings, but failed to file the supporting subaccounts which would have disclosed that items booked to the account were taxable. Taxable items were not listed for Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 136.320 taxation purposes. Thus, the separate accounts account for the periods in question qualified as omitted under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 132.290, and the retroactivity provisions of the statute were properly applied.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the circuit court erred when it held that the district court could only review the board's action for arbitrariness under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65.8831. Because the district court did not have appellate jurisdiction, the district court was to conduct a de novo review of the record created before the code enforcement board and was not confined to a determination as to whether the board's decision was arbitrary. Finally, the circuit court was to address whether the district court's finding that the private organization exemption applied to the facilities was correct based upon a review of the code enforcement board's record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court's judgment was reversed in part as to the applicable standard of review of the district court's decision, was vacated in part as to the circuit court's reversal of the district court's decision regarding the general applicability of the Smoke Free Law to the charitable organizations that rented the facilities. The matter was remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner Commonwealth of Kentucky, Cabinet for Health and Family Services (Cabinet), petitioned for writs of prohibition and mandamus to direct respondent Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) to vacate its order requiring counsel for defendant below to produce information concerning plaintiff below's prescription drug history contained in the Kentucky All-Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting (KASPER) records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.202(6), as amended in 2007, which prohibited the release of KASPER documents for any discovery or evidentiary purposes in civil actions, conflicted with Ky. R. Civ. P. 26.02(1). The Kentucky legislature did not create a privilege when it made KASPER records confidential. The conflict implicated the separation of powers doctrine. The portion of &sect; 218A.202(6) that precluded the release of KASPER records for discovery purposes was unconstitutional as it articulated a rule of practice that purported to control a responsibility assigned by the Kentucky Constitution to the Kentucky Judicial Branch. As KASPER records were confidential, it was error to order that they be produced solely based on a determination that the arguments of defendant's counsel provided good cause for the relief requested. After a preliminary showing of good cause, the KASPER records were to be produced under seal to the trial court for an in camera review so it could decide what portion of the records, if any, satisfied the relevancy requirement of Rule 26.02(1). Any ordered release of KASPER records was to be conditioned upon a confidentiality provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The relief sought was denied to the extent that it asked that the order for the release of plaintiff's KASPER records be vacated. The trial court was directed to issue an amended order requiring that the records be produced to the trial court under seal and for an in camera review to determine what portion of those records, if any, was relevant to the matter at issue and could be released. To that extent, the original action was granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) granted summary judgment dismissing a declaratory judgment action filed by appellant hospital, in which it claimed that the two-hospital limitation and the thirty-minute requirement imposed by appellee, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (Cabinet) issued under the 2004-2006 State Health Plan pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 194A.010, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the instant court found that the hospital raised a constitutional issue and had standing to challenge the selection criteria under the 2004-2006 State Health Plan, it first held that the selection criteria promulgated by the Cabinet did not constitute special or local legislation, as the classification was reasonable, natural, and consistent with the legitimate purpose of the government. Second, the Cabinet's regulation did not arbitrarily discriminate against urban hospitals in violation of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 2 and 3, as the Cabinet held a lengthy review process and considered numerous factors when drafting the regulation, and it was clear the Cabinet limited participation in the project to minimize exposure to the inherent risks. Likewise, in the interest of public health, it was reasonable for the Cabinet to study the feasibility of expanding emergency cardiac services to rural areas. As a result, the regulation survived a rational basis scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer filed tax returns based upon incorrect calculations. The commission issued the taxpayer a refund. The taxpayer sought an additional refund, which the commission did not approve based upon City of Louisville, Kentucky, General Codified Ordinances &sect; 112.20 and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 160.487. The appellate court held that there was nothing inherent in either the occupational tax ordinance or the statute that violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The commission did not collect or fail to apportion what was appropriately due. The taxpayer misconstrued its obligations under the ordinance and statute. Neither the board, transit authority, nor city could issue a refund independently from the commission. The taxpayer did not have an independent common law right to seek a refund. The occupational tax was authorized by both statute and ordinance. Because there was no possible penalty related to a failure to make the excess payment of the occupational tax, the taxpayer voluntarily paid the amount in dispute. There was nothing in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch.  96A that would make it a special or local act violative of the Ky. Const. &sect; 59.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the circuit court's ruling that the taxpayer was not entitled to any additional refund of the taxes it voluntarily overpaid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Individuals who were questioned by officers on a narcotics task force about their purchase of items commonly used to manufacture methamphetamine indicated that they were delivering the items to defendant. The two men cooperated in an undercover operation targeted at defendant, whereupon the items were delivered to him. Defendant failed to open the door when police approached, and the police forcibly entered the building because they believed that the evidence was being destroyed. Defendant refused to consent to a search, which was eventually conducted after a search warrant was obtained. The trial court denied suppression of evidence seized and defendant entered a conditional guilty plea. On appeal, the court found no error in the denial of suppression. Although the trial court had determined that the forcible entry was illegal, the warrant constituted an independent source that was sufficiently distinguishable, such that the forced entry was purged of its illegality. Accordingly, the exclusionary rule was not applicable in the circumstances. The search warrant was valid and it was based on a sufficient and truthful affidavit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court held that the children's therapists testified to the children's statements that they feared their stepfather would harm them in the future and that they did not want to reunify with their mother because of her inability or unwillingness to leave their stepfather. The statements fell within the Ky. R. Evid. 803(4) hearsay exception as they were made to the therapists in order to receive medical treatment. The mother's due process rights were not violated even though the children did not testify. The ramifications of the children's testimony was considered, and it was not in their best interests to testify. Moreover, the mother had had the opportunity to question the children during an in camera interview. There was substantial evidence that the mother had failed to provide the necessary food, clothing, shelter, medical care, or education for her children. The mother had not paid any child support in five months, and still resided in the stepfather's house. The stepfather paid the bills. Finally, termination of the mother's parental rights was proper under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 625.090(2)(c) as the mother abused her children or allowed them to be abused.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant drove his unmarked pick-up truck after midnight with a single orange, road-construction barrel in its bed. The appellate court held that as a matter of ordinary human experience the increasingly ubiquitous orange, road-construction barrels were ordinarily transported during daylight hours, in bunches, by marked construction or government vehicles. Thus, at the time of an investigatory stop leading to defendant's arrest and guilty plea, there was a reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was in possession of a stolen barrel. Even though the barrel was later shown to have been borrowed, the investigatory stop was not unconstitutional or improper. But for defendant's palpable intoxication, the stop would have been momentary and therefore not a significant violation of defendant's privacy interests when compared to the Commonwealth's significant interest in investigating possible criminal activity. The denial of the suppression motion was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants had brought suit challenging the ordinance on numerous state constitutional grounds and moved the trial court for a temporary restraining order and a temporary injunction enjoining appellee from enforcing or implementing the ordinance. On the day the complaint was filed, the trial court entered an order granting temporary injunctive relief enjoining appellee from enforcing the ordinance pending further orders of the court. The court rejected appellants' assertion to the contrary and held that Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 1 and 8 granted no greater protection to free speech and free expression than the United States Constitution. Because the purpose of the ordinance was to regulate the secondary effects associated with the businesses, and not the message allegedly conveyed therein, the court applied an intermediate standard of scrutiny. As such, the court determined the ordinance was content neutral and did not relate to the suppression of free speech. The court upheld the restrictions set forth in the ordinance prohibiting nudity, restricting the hours of operation, prohibiting alcohol sales, imposing staging requirements, etc., as within appellee's police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court upholding the constitutionality of the ordinance. As to the appeal, the court affirmed the judgment as to appellants and reversed the judgment of the trial court with regard to appellee's cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by the Knott Circuit Court (Kentucky) of possession of a controlled substance (a lesser-included offense of a trafficking count), possession of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of marijuana, following the denial of his motion to suppress. Defendant was sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Defendant's post-trial motions were denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that all evidence from a knock and talk should have been suppressed. The appellate court held that defendant's 15- or 16-year-old son consented to the entry into the house. The consent was voluntary and it was reasonable for the officers to believe that the son had the apparent authority to consent to their entry. Defendant voluntarily admitted to the officers that he possessed illegal substances, and voluntarily consented to a search of his person and of his bedroom. The son was old enough to consent to the entry. The officers made no effort to coerce or to deceive the son into granting them entry. The entry of the officers into defendant's bedroom did not exceed the son's consent. Probable cause was not so clearly established as to preclude the reasonableness of a knock and search visit. Defendant did not preserve his claim of error as to the chain of custody. Finally, a jury reasonably might have found defendant guilty of possession of a controlled substance instead of trafficking in a controlled substance. While the trial court was not obligated to tender a possession instruction in the face of an objection by defendant, its decision to do so was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant pled guilty to murder and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25 years. Later, appellant filed a motion against appellee Commonwealth, seeking a new sentencing hearing pursuant to Ky. R. Civ. P. 60.02(e), (f), and Ky. R. Crim. P. 11.42. The McCracken Circuit Court (Kentucky) denied the motion. Appellate sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was charged as an adult for a murder committed when he was 16 years old. Initially, the Commonwealth sought the death penalty, but as a result of negotiations, appellant pled guilty to murder and was sentenced to life without parole for 25 years. Later, the United States Supreme Court decided that someone under 18 when he committed murder was not subject to the death penalty. On the basis of this, appellant sought a new sentencing hearing. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the motion was untimely under Ky. R. Crim. P. 11.42(10). The constitutional right established in the United States Supreme Court's decision was not that an accused might escape a life sentence, and indeed, the opinion contained dictum to the effect that life imprisonment without parole remained a permissible sentence. Although that decision was to have been given retroactive application in all those cases in which a sentence of death was imposed on an accused who was under the age of 18 when he committed the crime, this was not such a case. Appellant did not claim that his plea was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent when it was made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two lists of nominees for the vacancy had been submitted to the governor by the committee; both lists were rejected. The governor chose a nominee from the third list submitted. The unsuccessful nominees had been named on the first rejected list.  The court concluded in its threshold inquiry that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12.070(3) applied to the governor's appointment of members of the state university's board of regents because the phrase &quot;administrative boards and commissions,&quot; while not defined in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12.010, could be construed pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 446.080 to include governing bodies of state universities. While Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 164.005(5)(a), which specifically applied to the appointment of board of regents members, could be interpreted to required the governor to make such an appointment from the first list of nominees, such a construction would require the first sentence of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12.070(3) to be given no effect, and, thus, the governor properly made an appointment from the third list submitted.</SPAN></P>

The officer patted him down and found cocaine inside a folded 10-dollar bill in defendant's pocket. Defendant alleged the drug was the fruit of an unlawful search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. He argued that the search of car, but not his person, was authorized under the automobile exception. The appellate court disagreed. As defendant was the driver and lone occupant of a car, the dog's alert to the presence of drugs inside the car gave officer the authority to search defendant drugs. Defendant argued that as the officer claimed he searched him for weapons, and did not believe that the folded money was contraband, the search could not be validated under the &quot;plain feel&quot; exception. The appellate court held that the test was not whether the officer's subjective belief was constitutionally adequate to support his action but whether the facts known to him could validate his actions under any permissible constitutional standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate entered a guilty plea to two counts of murder, in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat.

The inmate was denied parole on two occasions, with the Board directing the inmate to serve out his life sentences on the latter denial. The inmate filed his petition, alleging that the Board's issuance of the serve-out order violated 501 Ky. Admin. Regs. 1:011 (1983). The trial court agreed with the Board that no violation had occurred, and it granted summary judgment to the Board and dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court initially noted that dismissal was not warranted for the inmate's technical violation of Ky. R. Civ. P. 76.12(4)(c)(v). The court found that although the Board issued its serve-out order based on 501 Ky. Admin. Regs. 1:030(3)(f) (2003), there was no ex post facto violation because there was no enhancement of punishment or elongation of the inmate's sentence. The Board did not exceed its authority under Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to entering a guilty plea, defendant filed a motion challenging the constitutionality of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.500 and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.510. The Scott Circuit Court (Kentucky), in a summary order, found that the challenged statutes were constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 218A.500 and 218A.510 were vague and overbroad. The overbreadth argument was that the statutes criminalized the possession of items, such as rolling papers, that may have had both legal and illegal uses. The appellate court held that defendant was correct that the items he had in his possession, including rolling papers, a rolling machine, scissors, and a water bong, could all have legal uses. However, when viewed in the context of his arrest, including the fact that defendant's van had an odor of marijuana smoke, defendant admitted that he had recently been smoking marijuana, and defendant's prior conviction for possession of both marijuana and paraphernalia, clearly provided a context within Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.510 to support the citation for possession of paraphernalia. Therefore, as applied to defendant, the statutes were not overbroad. As to the claim of vagueness, the appellate court held that the statutes clearly gave a person of common intelligence notice of what was unlawful under the statutes. Thus, the appellate court held that the trial court properly found that the statutes were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Later, appellant filed Ky. R. Crim. P. 11.42 and Ky. R. Civ. P. 60.02 motions against appellee State, requesting a new sentencing hearing. The Lawrence Circuit Court (Kentucky) denied the motions. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought relief based on a recent United States Supreme Court decision which found death sentences for juveniles between the ages of 15 and 18 were unconstitutional. However, the appellate court found that this holding did not affect the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility for parole for a minimum of 25 years, which was the sentence imposed in this case. Appellant argued that the Commonwealth's offer to recommend a sentence less than death had become meaningless as such sentences were now forbidden. The appellate court disagreed. Appellant knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered into the plea agreement in order to receive what was then, and was still, a constitutionally valid sentence for his multiple crimes. The mere fact the law had changed such as to lower the ceiling of possible sentences did not deprive him of the benefit he received from his bargain.</SPAN></P>

Appellants admittedly became aware of the zoning compliance officer's recommended interpretation of the term &quot;tourist home&quot; at an earlier hearing. Appellants did not appeal the officer's actions to the board. The appellate court held that appellants' attempt to have the trial court and the appellate court review the officer's interpretation was untimely. That interpretation stood. Appellants also argued that the board's decision to grant the conditional use permit was an unconstitutional exercise of arbitrary power. However, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 100.237 gave the board the power to grant conditional use permits. Woodford County, Kentucky, Zoning Regulations, art. VII, &sect; 701.4 specifically named &quot;Tourist Home along State or Federal Highway&quot; as a conditional use in the A-1 zone.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate sought relief under Rule 11.42, alleging juror misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court granted relief after hearing testimony from a juror in the case that established that the jury had consulted a dictionary during deliberations for the definition of the word rape. On appeal, the Commonwealth argued that the trial court improperly heard testimony from the juror under Ky. R. Crim. P. 10.04. The appellate court affirmed, holding that 1) contrary to the restrictions in Rule 10.04, overt acts of misconduct by jurors could be considered by a trial court dealing with allegations of juror misconduct; 2) using a dictionary to look up the meaning of &quot;rape&quot; was an overt act; 3) the inmate was clearly prejudiced by the juror misconduct as the dictionary definition did not require penetration while penetration was a required element in Kentucky's rape statutes; and 4) as the trial court did not err in granting the inmate relief, there was no need to address his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A grand jury returned a &quot;No True Bill&quot; when presented with various felony and misdemeanor theft charges against appellee. The charges were dismissed without prejudice to refiling. Recognizing that &sect; 431.076 did not facially apply when charges were dismissed without prejudice, the trial court granted the petition, stating that it was exercising the sound discretion and inherent power of the trial court to fairly administer justice. The appellate court reversed, finding that there was no justification for expungement under the law. The words of &sect; 431.076 were clear and unambiguous. They plainly stated that records could be expunged when there was a verdict of not guilty or when a case was dismissed with prejudice. The state legislature intentionally put the words &quot;with prejudice&quot; in the statute. Reading the statute to also include instances where a case was dismissed without prejudice would disregard the plain language of the statute. The appellate court noted that case law indicated that courts had inherent power to expunge records in instances in which there was no statutory authority, however, those instances were extremely limited and did not apply in appellee's case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenant tripped and fell over a three-inch gap in the carpet at the apartment.

The tenant stated that she made several additional requests for repairs over the next 10 weeks. The landlords denied receiving any such requests from the tenant. The trial court concluded that the URLTA did not alter the common-law rule that a lessor had no duty to repair leased premises in the absence of an agreement to do so. The landlords were not liable for injuries caused by breach of any covenant to make repairs to the leased premises. Rather, the remedy for breach of an agreement to repair was the cost of repair. Even if the alleged oral representations could have imposed such a duty on the landlords, the tenant was still not entitled to recover damages for her injuries.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 506.080), complicity, and engaging in organized crime (Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 506.120). The Ballard Circuit Court (Kentucky) followed the jury's recommendation and sentenced him to 10 years' imprisonment. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and four others manufactured methamphetamine at two houses. He claimed manufacturing methamphetamine was not a predicate offense for the organized crime charge. The appellate court disagreed; illegal trafficking was part of the definition of &quot;criminal syndicate&quot; under &sect; 506.120(3)(e), and under &sect; 506.120(1)(b), one engaged in organized crime by providing material aid to maintain the syndicate. His conviction of facilitation of the manufacture of methamphetamine and of being an accomplice in a criminal syndicate did not violate the double jeopardy ban, since each offense required proof of a fact that the other did not. The amendment of the indictment was proper under Ky. R. Crim. P. 6.16, as no new offense was charged and defendant was not prejudiced. The evidence was sufficient to prove defendant facilitated the manufacture of methamphetamine. The searches of both houses were constitutional. Defendant's request under Ky. R. Evid. 615 to separate witnesses was untimely. Before considering probation, the trial court stated it would follow the jury's sentencing recommendation; it thus failed to give proper consideration to probation under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 533.010(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court vacated and remanded the judgment of the trial court for consideration of probation and resentencing in compliance with Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Kenton Circuit Court (Kentucky) determined that appellee ex-husband had been a devoted father to two girls, performing the majority of the everyday tasks related to their upbringing and essentially serving as their primary parent. Thus, it concluded that he was the de facto custodian and that appellant biological father and the mother were estopped from denying that he was the legal father. The biological father and mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Several months into dissolution proceedings, the ex-husband learned for the first time that the two youngest children born during his 15-year marriage to the mother were not his biological daughters. The mother had been having an extra-marital affair with the biological father. The mother and biological father realized that he was possibly the children's father, but they had no tests done until the dissolution proceedings. The appellate court held that while the ex-husband did not qualify for de facto custodian status under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 403.270, the biological father's conduct might preclude him from displacing the ex-husband altogether in the girls' lives as Kentucky recognized the applicability of the doctrine of waiver in a child custody dispute. The doctrine of paternity by estoppel did not apply so as to estop the biological father and mother from seeking a paternity determination. Finally, as to the mother's 401(k) retirement account, the trial court erred in deeming it marital property without considering Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 403.190(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The portion of the trial court's judgment dismissing the biological father's petition for custody or visitation was reversed and remanded for the trial court to address whether he had waived the typically superior custody rights of a biological father. The trial court's original property supplemental decree was reversed to the extent that the mother's 401(k) retirement account was not exempted from property division.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant daughter sought review of an order of the Perry Circuit Court (Kentucky), which granted summary judgment on the issue of whether the daughter had an ownership interest in real property. Appellees were the buyer of several undivided interests in property from a decedent's estate and the possessor of the property. The buyer had instituted the action, seeking a partition of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The daughter was the illegitimate child of the decedent. She claimed sole ownership of the property in question as the decedent's only heir-at-law. The appellate court affirmed. The daughter had no claim to the property. At the time of his death in 1962, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 391.090(2) governed the intestate succession of the decedent's property. Under that statute, illegitimate children could recover only from their mother's estates. Although the statute was struck down in 1977 as unconstitutional, the Kentucky Supreme Court specifically stated that its opinion finding the statute invalid would not be applied retroactively. Thus, upon his death on December 29, 1962, the decedent's property passed to his heirs-at-law under the then-existing laws of intestate succession. Those heirs were identified in a May 1967 affidavit of descent filed by one of the decedent's second cousins.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence was discovered by deputies who had accompanied a child protective services investigator during a mandatory investigation pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 620.040(1). Appellant did not dispute that he gave the deputies and investigator consent to enter his house. When the investigator entered the closed bedroom to investigate the referral she had received regarding the possible neglect of children, it was not unreasonable for the deputies to also enter the room because the visit was not criminal in nature. Thus, the deputies did not need to receive appellant's consent to enter the bedroom. Even if it was unreasonable to enter the bedroom, exigent circumstances existed where the deputies entered the bedroom with the investigator after she informed appellant she was required to look in that room. Moreover, the deputies had obtained a search warrant after observing drug manufacturing evidence in plain view in the bedroom. The evidence discovered in the kitchen was also properly seized where a deputy was lawfully in the kitchen to get a drink for a child and the evidence was in plain view.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee maternal grandparents filed an ex parte motion seeking custody of their grandchildren. The Madison Family Court (Kentucky) ordered that the grandparents had to agree with appellant mother's visitation with her children and sua sponte modified the grandparents' visitation by giving them an extra weekend of visitation each month. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents entered into an agreed order under which they had joint custody and the grandparents had visitation of one weekend per month. In their multiple court filings, the grandparents never alleged that the mother and father were unfit; that the children were dependent, neglected or abused; or that the grandparents were acting as de facto custodians. The appellate court held that awarding the grandparents additional visitation was error, as they had not sought such relief under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 405.021, the trial court did not find that additional visitation would be in the children's best interest, nor did it consider the Vibbert factors. The only right the grandparents had regarding the children involved visitation. By filing ex parte motions seeking custody when they disagreed with the parents' decisions, they unduly interfered with the parents' constitutionally protected rights to make decisions for their children. However, since the grandparents had been granted visitation pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 405.021, they remained parties to the action to that extent; therefore, the appellate court denied the mother's request to dismiss them from the dissolution action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The orders awarding additional visitation to the grandparents and requiring their approval of any changes regarding the mother's time with the children were vacated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants filed suit challenging Bracken County, Ky., Ordinance &sect;&sect; 53.91 and 53.92, enacted by appellee, the Bracken County, Kentucky, Fiscal Court. These ordinances banned pit bull terriers and provided penalties for persons who owned them; appellants alleged they were inconsistent with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 258.095's definition of &quot;vicious dog.&quot; The Bracken Circuit Court (Kentucky) dismissed the complaint; appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that under its police powers, the fiscal court could ban pit bull terriers and take them without compensation. The appellate court agreed. The ordinance was supplemental to, not inconsistent with, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 258, which banned vicious dogs generally, as it did not limit ch. 258's application but provided more comprehensive protection. The fiscal court's determination that pit bull terriers had &quot;inherently vicious and dangerous propensities&quot; was reasonable, given the evidence to support that finding. As the forfeiture and destruction of such dogs was pursuant to a valid exercise of the police power, no compensation was due to their owners. The ordinance gave an owner the opportunity to appear in court and present evidence and defenses to the action; therefore, procedural due process was afforded. The right to travel guaranteed by the Equal Protection and Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the U.S. Constitution did not require that when traveling to another jurisdiction, a person had to be given benefits that were superior to those enjoyed by the jurisdiction's own residents simply because the traveler enjoyed those benefits in another place.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 625.090, appellant mother filed a petition for involuntary termination of appellee father's parental rights with respect to appellee child. The Bell Circuit Court (Kentucky) denied the petition; the mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother alleged the father had severely beaten her and had held her and the child hostage; that he failed to pay child support; and had abandoned his child for nearly two years. The father admitted fighting with the mother, but denied the severity of the assault. He admitted failing to pay child support, but alleged he was prevented from seeing his son due to a protective order the mother had obtained. The appellate court initially held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 625.110, which allowed appeals only from an order granting a termination petition, was unconstitutional because it violated the mother's right to appeal guaranteed by Ky. Const. &sect; 115. Therefore, she had standing to appeal the order denying her termination petition. However, she had presented no evidence to support a finding that termination of the father's parental rights was in the child's best interest. Because the evidence did not compel a finding that the father's parental rights should have been terminated under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 625.090(1), the trial court's decision was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer sought review of an order of the Campbell Circuit Court (Kentucky), which dismissed the taxpayer's complaint against appellee county, challenging a county occupational license fee ordinance adopted pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 68.197, as amended. The trial court found that the amendment to &sect; 68.197 and the fee ordinance were both constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The fee ordinance was first authorized in a public question approved by the voters pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 120.250 to fund traffic improvement and mass transportation projects. On review, the court affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer's challenge. The ballot question met the requirements of &sect; 120.250 and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 83A.120, and the court found that the taxpayer's challenge was untimely under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 120.250. The court also found that the constitutional challenges had no merit. Although Ky. Const. &sect; 59 prohibited local or special acts, there were distinctive and natural reasons setting those counties whose license fees were authorized by public question apart from other counties such that a legitimate legislative purpose to relieve threatened fiscal hardship was served by requiring latter counties to credit license fees but relieving the former from that requirement. The application of the amendment to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 68.197 retroactively did not violate due process because the amendment did not withdraw a provision upon which taxpayers had relied but merely sought to clarify the license fee credit provision in the wake of a court opinion.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to &sect;&nbsp;403.212(2)(g)(4) the mother's gross income was reduced by a deduction of imputed child support because of the mother's prior-born child. the father was not permitted to make a similar deduction on his income calculation for an after-born child. The court held that &sect; 403.212(2)(g)(4) did not violate the father's equal protection rights because the state had an interest in seeing that the prior-born child was provided for and &sect; 403.212(2)(g)(4) was rationally related to that state interest.

The appellate court held the limitations period was tolled by a court order setting aside the Board's order as, until the court order was vacated, there was nothing to enforce. By excluding this time, the enforcement action was not time-barred. Laches did not bar restitution and back pay claims. Vacating the sheriff's request for judicial review for lack of jurisdiction did not deny it as he could have refiled under the saving statute, but did not, so claim preclusion barred his claims. Comparing what the employee would have earned as a deputy sheriff each year of his termination to his actual earnings, rather than comparing his total earnings over the period to what his total earnings as a deputy sheriff would have been, did not abuse discretion. The sheriff's recalcitrance after termination did not bear on the award in a suit to enforce an administrative board's order. Attorney's fees were not recoverable under the merit board statutes, a contract, or quantum meruit. The Board could not award damages for lost opportunity to pursue a law enforcement career or punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

Appellees, Kentucky Legal Aid and the wife, filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife filed a petition for dissolution of her marriage to her spouse. An attorney with Kentucky Legal Aid represented the wife, and she was granted leave to proceed without payment of costs. The family court granted the wife's request for an appointment of a warning order attorney, pursuant to Ky. R. Civ. P. 4.06-4.08. The warning order attorney sought to recover a $150 fee for his work. The family court denied the motion for a warning order fee because the wife was not required to pay the fee due to her indigent status and the Kentucky Finance Cabinet could not be required to pay the fee. The court determined initially that Kentucky Legal Aid was not a proper party to the appeal because it was not a party to the proceeding below. By virtue of her indigency, the wife was exempted from paying the warning order attorney's fees. Although the attorney was entitled to recover the fee under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 453.060(2), there essentially was not a party available to pay the fee. The court acknowledged that the failure to pay the warning order attorney constituted a taking under U.S. Const. amend. 5 and Ky. Const. &sect; 13, and no party had the resources in which to compensate him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the proceedings against Kentucky Legal Aid. The court affirmed the family court's order denying the request for the payment of warning order attorney's fees from the wife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Claimant appealed an opinion of the Workers' Compensation Board (Kentucky), which had found that he could not receive additional benefits upon reopening his claim for worsening of pneumoconiosis because he had no additional exposure to coal dust since filing an earlier petition to reopen. Claimant challenged the constitutionality of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.125(5)(a), and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316(12), and alleged a mistake.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Claimant had previously filed a petition to reopen his claim, and he filed the instant petition thereafter. The Board denied his petition, finding that he had not shown additional exposure to coal dust since filing his earlier petition. Claimant contended that the requirement for an additional exposure was a violation of his due process and equal protection rights, because no such showing was required for other types of claims. The court held that the legislature had a rational basis for requiring additional exposure under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.125(5)(a), and that the doctrine of res judicata also applied. In addition, the court observed that there was a need for finality of decisions and that because &sect; 342.125(5)(a) was more specific than &sect; 342.125(1)(d), its requirement of additional exposure controlled. The court also held that claimant's constitutional challenges were not precluded for failure to exhaust his remedies, because the Board could not pass on the constitutionality of legislation. However, because the Board had not addressed claimant's contention of a mistake in his filing, additional proceedings on that issue were required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the opinion in part, remanding to the Board to determine whether claimant had met the requirements for reopening his claim on the grounds of mistake.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant bank (mortgagee) appealed a $ 98,000 judgment entered by the Whitley Circuit Court (Kentucky) for appellee mortgagors under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 382.365 after the mortgagee failed to timely release a mortgage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mortgagors argued that the mortgagee did not release a mortgage until 234 days after it had notice that the mortgage had been satisfied. The appellate court held that the mortgagors suffered no damages, actual or threatened, due to the delay in releasing the mortgage. A mortgagor's daughter was aware of the penalty and would &quot;normally&quot; follow-up on notice letters if the mortgage was not promptly released, but she did not do so with her mother's mortgage. Receipt of the notice was an element of the cause of action. It was a little unclear whether the trial court found that the mortgagee received the notice, but even if the trial court did not find that the mortgagee received the notice, the findings were sufficient as there was no motion for additional findings. The statute was not unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause and Ky. Const. &sect; 2 as the mortgagors had a duty to act reasonably and in good faith. Further, the mortgagors' rights flowed from a contract, in which there was an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Finally, the exclusion of line of credit and revolving credit plan mortgages from Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 382.365 did not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 59.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was set aside. The case was remanded for a new trial as to damages only, with the mortgagors receiving such amounts as accrued under the statute while they were acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) ordered appellants, a corporation and its president, to comply with a subpoena duces tecum issued by the director of appellee, the Kentucky Office of Financial Institutions' Division of Securities. In the subpoena, the Division sought financial records, records of the corporation's drilling practices, and a list of all investors and the amount of the interest each held. Appellants challenged the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Division was investigating investor complaints against the corporation. The court stated that it had been held by the United States Supreme Court that an administrative subpoena should be enforced if the inquiry was within the authority of the agency, the demand was not too indefinite, and the information sought was reasonably relevant. Here, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 292.460 authorized the director to inquire concerning potential violations of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 292.320, regarding securities fraud. The corporation did not claim that the subpoena was too broad, and the records sought were clearly relevant. The director's authority had not been preempted by the National Security Markets Improvement Act of 1996, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 77r. It permitted the states to retain jurisdiction over fraudulent conduct. Under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 292.320, the director's authority was not limited to fraud practiced against Kentucky residents. Finally, an administrative subpoena satisfying the Supreme Court's test did not violate the Fourth Amendment or Ky. Const. &sect; 2, and because the corporation's activities were solely commercial, a demand for a list of investors did not offend the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with DUI after a vehicle stop at a seat belt safety roadblock. He filed motions to suppress, arguing the roadblock was unconstitutional and was a violation of Ky. Rev. Stat.

The motions were denied. Defendant pled guilty while reserving his right to appeal that denial. On appeal, the court found that the roadblock was neither constitutionally nor statutorily improper, so the stop of defendant's vehicle and his resulting arrest were proper. While &sect; 189.125(7) prohibited routine traffic stops for a seat belt violation, roadblocks to check for general motor vehicle safety violations were not prohibited. The roadblock: (1) was solely used to promote the state's strong interest in preventing traffic accidents and in promoting highway safety; (2) met nearly every factor in the Kentucky State Police Traffic Safety Checkpoint Policy, which was known as the OM-E-4 guideline; and (3) was minimally intrusive and did not involve an unconstitutional exercise of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Cabinet for Health and Family Services appealed an order by the Warren Circuit Court, Family Division, (Kentucky) that restricted placement of two children to a specific county; the Cabinet claimed that the family court's restriction on where it could place the children was unduly burdensome on its efforts to reunite the family.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the children were committed to the custody of the Cabinet, appellee mother, who was incarcerated for alcohol-related charges, stipulated to having neglected the children. The children were placed with foster parents in a certain county. After the mother's release from jail, she moved to a different county that was approximately 100 miles away from the children. The family court determined that the children should remain under the Cabinet's care and commitment and that the Cabinet's permanency goal of reunification was in the children's best interests. Nevertheless, it ordered the Cabinet to keep the children's residence in the first county. The appellate court held that pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 610.010(11), the Legislature conferred sole and exclusive authority upon the Cabinet to determine the appropriate placement of the children committed to its care. In addition, Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 27, 28 precluded the trial court's exercise of executive powers, such as ordering the placement of children. Therefore, the family court erred in restricting the Cabinet's ability to place the children in a home nearer to their mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order was vacated as to the limitation of the children's placement, the case was remanded for entry of a corrected order; the order was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the Boone Circuit Court (Kentucky), which granted a motion by the Commonwealth to forfeit defendant's vehicle which was seized by police after it was found to contain drugs. Defendant argued that the forfeiture of his vehicle violated the principle of double jeopardy and was unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was pulled over for speeding. A search of the vehicle revealed cocaine. Defendant pled guilty and was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment. While his direct appeal was pending, defendant tried to get the vehicle back, ostensibly to allow his fiancee to use it. The Commonwealth argued that under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.410, the vehicle was subject to forfeiture because it had been used to transport cocaine. Defendant testified that he had bought the vehicle with proceeds from a personal injury settlement. The appellate court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.405 et seq., while perhaps having certain punitive aspects, served important nonpunitive goals. In most cases, there would be a close association between a criminal conviction and a forfeiture pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.405 et seq. However, that did not mean that the forfeiture constituted an additional criminal punishment. There was not a substantial possibility that the result in defendant's case would have been any different if the excessive fines question had been presented to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers had filed a class action declaratory judgment complaint alleging that Kentucky's decision to tax the income earned on out-of-state bonds was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The cumulative impact of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;141.020, 141.030, 141.040 was that Kentucky exempted from taxation interest income derived from bonds issued by the Commonwealth or its subdivisions but required taxes to be paid on interest income derived from bonds issued by a sister state or its subdivisions. The taxpayers asserted that the tax on the income earned on the out-of-state bonds violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The trial court found that the tax system at issue was constitutional and that the taxpayers lacked standing to challenge the tax provisions. The court found that Kentucky's bond taxation system was facially unconstitutional as it afforded more favorable treatment to in-state bonds than it did to extraterritorially issued bond. Further, the court found that the trial court erred by finding that the taxpayers lacked standing to represent the class as that issue was not before the trial court pursuant to the Department's motion for summary judgment and the taxpayers had basic personal standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the trial court's order granting summary judgment to the Department and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner governor sought an order in the nature of mandamus directing the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) to give his pardon-specific instructions to a grand jury to ensure that the grand jury understood its constitutional role and to prevent it from issuing indictments that impinged upon the governor's pardoning power under Ky. Const. &sect; 77.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A special grand jury was empaneled to investigate whistle-blower allegations that officials in the governor's administration had violated the classified service statutes, commonly referred to as the merit system. After the grand jury issued numerous indictments, the governor issued an executive order pardoning the indictees and others who might be indicted for the same offenses. When the grand jury continued to issue indictments for pardoned offenses, the governor requested the circuit court to supplement its instructions to the grand jury by specifying what he maintained was the legal effect of the pardon. The appellate court held that although the governor's power under &sect; 77 extended to the sort of pre-indictment general amnesty that the executive order purported to grant, his arguments overstated the effect of a pardon and the authorities upon which he relied did not compel the result he sought. The governor's pardoning power did not preclude indictment for pardoned offenses and did not oblige the circuit court to instruct the grand jury concerning the effect of such pardons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a decedent's two minor children and her estate, sued defendant employer after the decedent was killed when a steel coil fell off one of the employer's tractor-trailer rigs. The Gallatin Circuit Court (Kentucky) granted plaintiffs summary judgment on the issue of liability. A jury awarded plaintiffs compensatory damages of $ 667,267 and punitive damages of $ 1 million, from which the employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the employer's driver braked, a 15-ton steel coil broke loose from the trailer and struck the decedent's vehicle; she died shortly thereafter. There was evidence that the employer knew of three prior, similar accidents in which steel coils fell from trucks, but no safety awareness meetings were held before the accident at issue. The appellate court rejected the employer's claim that this evidence inflamed the jury; it was relevant to show that the employer was on notice that steel coils could break free from trailers, and there was no indication that the punitive damage award was intended to punish the employer for the three prior incidents. The employer was properly found vicariously liable for punitive damages based on evidence of its own negligence in ensuring that steel coils were safely secured. Jury instructions that closely tracked Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.186 provided constitutionally-sufficient standards for assessing punitive damages. A ratio of 1 to 1.5 between punitive and compensatory damages was within constitutional limits. The decedent's pre-impact fear was compensable. No expert testimony was needed to establish damages for loss of parental consortium.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The magistrate argued that the trial court erred by concluding that his duties as assistant road foreman were incompatible with his duties as a magistrate. The appellate court found that, as a member of the fiscal court, the magistrate was authorized and called upon to consider matters involving salary, tenure, and promotion of county employees. This close interrelationship between the positions rendered the magistrate's concurrent employment with the county road department incompatible with his elected office. In addition, the fiscal court was directly responsible for the implementation of the county road program, had authority over the county road supervisor, and was responsible for approving his proposed policies. Since the magistrate was employed as assistant county road foreman, he was subordinate to the county road supervisor while having the capacity to exert control over his supervisor in his role as a member of the fiscal court. This concurrent public employment and occupancy of this public office were thus functionally incompatible. The incompatibility doctrine did not unduly burden free speech or free association in this case.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 411.190. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The government built an &quot;extreme park&quot; made of concrete where bikers, skateboarders, and roller bladers could negotiate undulating terrain, deep bowls, and full pipes. The minor, 11 years old, accidentally rode his bike from the beginners' area over a precipitous drop into an 11-foot bowl and was seriously injured. The park had signs warning users to know their abilities, to have parental supervision, and to wear helmets and pads. Under &sect; 411.190(6), landowners were not immune from suit for willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition. The appellate court found that there was a material fact issue as to whether the government acted willfully toward the minor in failing to erect a physical barrier between the beginners' course and the 11-foot bowl (failure to guard), or in the manner in which it warned users of the park of the potential dangers lurking therein (failure to warn). To constitute willful conduct it was not necessary to show ill will, but an entire absence of care for the life, person, or property of others which exhibited indifference to consequences. The question of willfulness was for the jury to decide.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee citizen's group brought an action against, among others, appellants, a city and property owner, seeking to have an agreed upon judgment entered in a separate case set aside. The Hardin Circuit Court (Kentucky) granted the relief and ordered the agreed upon judgment set aside. The city and the owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The agreed upon judgment at issue allowed the owner to run a quarry on the land, and provided for the city to receive certain acreage. The trial court found that this was illegal judicial rezoning. The appellate court agreed. Rezoning was not a judicial function, and a court did not have the authority to order a particular classification be applied to land. The agreed judgment, in essence, zoned the property. The city had no classification that would have allowed a quarry. Thus, the agreed judgment improperly created the zone, and it applied it only to the owner. Under Ky. R. Civ. P. 60.02, a motion attacking a judgment as void was not required to be filed within a specific time. The trial court properly found that the motion to set aside was made in a reasonable time, since the citizen's group had been challenging the agreed judgment in one way or another since it was entered, and the city and the owner were not misled by any delay. The agreed judgment's provisions giving the city the acreage and settling the zoning issues were tied together, and thus it would have been inequitable to set aside only part of the agreed judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was exposed to insulation products on the contractors' property, and he was diagnosed with an incurable form of cancer associated with exposure to asbestos. Thereafter, an action was filed against the contractors. The contractors' motion for summary judgment was granted, and the executrix and the heirs sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the claims were barred under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 342.610, 342.690. First, the issue of &quot;regular or recurrent&quot; was an issue of law to be decided by the court if the underlying facts concerning business operations were not in dispute. Next, entitlement to protection under &sect;&sect; 342.610, 342.690 was strictly construed. The work performed by the employee was a regular or recurrent part of the business of the 16 contractors. The employee's consent to the Kentucky Workers' Compensation Act negated any argument that the application of &sect;&sect; 342.610, 342.690 was unconstitutional under the jural rights doctrine. The trial court properly allowed the amendment of certain pleadings, the contractors had secured workers' compensation insurance, and the failure to allow more discovery was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff was severely injured when a car operated by the driver struck him. The driver had vehicle liability insurance through a policy with the insurer. Plaintiff had UIM policies with other insurers, which paid him benefits. Plaintiff filed a personal injury complaint against the driver and he received an award of damages. The insurer moved for an order of satisfaction, arguing Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 304.39-320 limited plaintiff's recovery by the amount he already recovered in UIM benefits, which resulted in satisfaction of the tort award. The trial court agreed. Plaintiff appealed, arguing that the collateral source rule applied and denied the other driver a setoff for the UIM payments. The insurer argued that applying the collateral source rule allowed plaintiff a double recovery, and that &sect; 304.39-320 entitled the driver to a setoff for the UIM payments. The court found, first, that the collateral source rule applied to UIM insurance payments just as it applied to other insurance payments. Also, an interpretation of &sect; 304.39-320 as authorizing a setoff violated Ky. Const. &sect; 54, even if a double recovery occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) granted appellee employee's appeal from an administrative proceeding and overruled a final order rendered by appellant the Kentucky Retirement System (System). The effect of said order allowed the employee to purchase five years of non-qualified service credit at a price reflective of her actual salary and required the System to refund any excess payment made by her, plus interest. The System appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The System challenged the judgment entered. But, the appeals court held that it erroneously calculated the employee's current rate of pay, that said calculation was illogical and unfair to the employee because it did not contemplate her actual earnings, and that the System misapplied the statutory formula for calculating the cost of her non-qualified service credit. The employee's cost to purchase the service credit was to be based upon her final rate of pay. The System contended that because the employee worked 8-hour days, its calculation of her final rate of pay did not reflect her actual hours or days worked. The System knew that the employee worked an 8-hour day, but only 24.5 hours per week. It also knew that she was a permanent part-time employee working only 100 hours per month, earning approximately $ 32,000 per year. It was clear from the evidence presented that both the System and the hearing officer ignored that information in reaching its decision as to the employee's actual hours worked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Christian Circuit Court (Kentucky), following a judicial sale of assessed property, entered a judgment that awarded to appellant delinquency certificate purchaser the principal amount of its certificates and interest after it sued to recover the amount of certificates of delinquency it had purchased and to foreclose the tax liens associated with the certificates. The trial court declined to award attorney fees, and the purchaser appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A Kentucky corporation became the owner of several acres of land. The county annually assessed ad valorem property taxes against the corporation for state, county, school taxes, and special taxing district assessments. It then failed to file its state corporate income tax and state license taxes, and fell behind in its property tax payments. The sheriff, pursuant to state statutory authority, offered those delinquent property tax claims for the sale to the public. The delinquency certificate purchaser acquired two of the claims by purchasing two certificates of delinquency. It later filed suit to recover on its certificates of delinquency, with interest, an to enforce the tax liens on the Kentucky corporation's property. Eventually, the trial court entered judgment in the delinquency certificate purchaser's favor for the amount of the certificates, plus court costs. However, the trial court denied its request for attorney fees. On appeal, the appellate court found that it had a statutory right to attorney fees, but also concluded that other arguments it raised were waived for its failure to raise them in the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's judgment, to the extent it denied the delinquency certificate purchaser's attorney fee request, was reversed and that part of the judgment was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. In all other respects, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city sought review of a judgment of the Pulaski Circuit Court (Kentucky), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee annexed taxpayers and concluded that the city's assessment and levy of taxes on the taxpayers violated statutory requirements. The taxpayers cross-appealed from the circuit court's ruling that while the taxpayers were entitled to refunds, they could not recover the refunds in their class-action lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers filed suit, arguing that the city had improperly collected taxes from them after their properties were annexed into the city because the city failed to file accurate maps as required by statute. The circuit court agreed but then found that the taxpayers' requested relief could not be granted because they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and that refunds could not be given in a class-action setting. The court affirmed in part, holding that (1) based on changes the legislature made to the language in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 134.590, class action suits for taxpayer refunds were permissible; (2) there was no legal basis for holding the taxpayers liable for the value of the benefits they received as a result of the annexations; (3) discovery from the taxpayers about those benefits was properly denied; (4) the taxpayers' action did not fall within the scope of &sect; 134.590(6) and thus, they exhausted their administrative remedies by filing requests for refunds; and (5) &sect; 134.590 did not allow for interest on ad valorem tax refunds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment on the issue of the improper levy and collection of the taxes.

The court affirmed the circuit court's ruling on all of the other issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insured was involved in an automobile accident with appellees and filed a lawsuit against them. The lawsuit was initiated by the insured against appellees and was filed within the applicable statute of limitations period. The insurer intervened in the action and the trial court dismissed the insurer's claim, finding that the claim was barred under the two-year limitation period set forth in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.125. The court held that it was error to dismiss the insurer's claim. As a subrogee, the insurer's claim was derivative of the insured's claim, and the statute of limitations that was applicable to the insured was also applicable to the insurer. The court did not decide which statute of limitations was applicable to the insurer's claim, finding instead that the insurer's complaint should have been allowed because it related to the insured's lawsuit, was filed as part of the insured's lawsuit, and intervention was thus allowed pursuant to Ky. R. Civ. P. 24. Intervention by the insured prior to trial or other disposition of the case was presumptively timely.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff alleged victim of sexual abuse sued defendant church, seeking damages for its actions, or lack of action, concerning alleged sexual abuse by a priest who worked for the church. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) denied the church's motion for summary judgment and its motion to alter, amend, or vacate. The church appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The church argued that the statute of limitations barred the alleged victim's claim under either Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.249 or Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.140. The appellate court ruled that the general rule under Ky. R. Civ. P. 56.03 was that a denial of a motion for summary judgment was, first, not appealable because of its interlocutory nature and, second, was not reviewable on appeal from a final judgment where the question was whether there existed a genuine issue of material fact. Because there had not yet been a final judgment entered in the case from which an appeal was taken, that exception to the rule had no application. The trial court's inclusion of Ky. R. Civ. P. 54.02 finality language in its initial denial of the summary judgment motion was meaningless because that rule was limited to actions involving multiple parties or multiple claims, which was not the case. Even if Ky. R. Civ. P. 54.02 applied and could have operated to make the interlocutory judgment final and appealable, there had been no conclusive determination of the rights of any party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Meade Circuit Court (Kentucky) convicted defendant of third-degree rape under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 510.060, and sentenced him to one year in prison and a subsequent three-year period of conditional discharge as required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect;532.043. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect;532.043 violated the separation of powers doctrine by infringing upon the judiciary's duty to administer justice and by removing all discretion from the trial court by imposing a three-year mandatory conditional discharge. The appeals court disagreed. The Kentucky Legislature, rather than the judiciary, designated the elements of criminal conduct and the penalty for crimes. Similarly, the legislature did not unconstitutionally usurp judicial functions by eliminating the exercise of discretion by the trial court in fixing a sentence, as it had the plenary power to set criminal penalties. Second, since defendant pled guilty and was not sentenced by a jury, his request that the appeals court declare &sect; 532.043 to be in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.055 and the constitutional guarantee of due process lacked merit. Finally, defendant failed to show that the conditions of his conditional discharge on any protected-constitutional activity was sufficiently real and substantial in relation to the legitimate scope of government regulation of persons on supervisory release to justify a facial challenge with the relaxed standing approach.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Transportation Cabinet, sought review of a decision of the Knott Circuit Court, (Kentucky), which entered judgment in favor of appellee driver and determined that 601 Ky. Admin. Regs. 13:025 (1990), amounted to an arbitrary exercise of power when it was used to suspend the driver's privilege to drive after accumulating too many speeding tickets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver was convicted two times in a two year period for speeding 16 to 25 miles per hour and a total of 12 points were assessed against his license. Under 601 Ky. Admin. Regs. 13:025 (1990), the driver's privilege to drive was suspended by the Cabinet after a hearing. The Cabinet did not offer any evidence at the hearing other than the two traffic convictions. The driver challenged the regulation and the hearing by filing a complaint with the lower court, and the lower court granted judgment in favor of the driver, concluding that 601 Ky. Admin. Regs. 13:025 (1990) amounted to an arbitrary exercise of power because the point-system failed to rely upon accident-cause statistics as mandated by the regulation. The court held that 601 Ky. Admin. Regs. 13:025 (1990), as adopted August 9, 1990, and as applied through 1997 was invalid. The evidence overwhelmingly established that the Cabinet failed to follow 601 Ky. Admin. Regs. 13:025 (1990) when it did not use the accident-cause statistics when it created the point system. The court reversed the lower court's decision to the extent that it attempted to require the current version of the regulation to be &quot;revamped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the lower court to the extent that it found that the 1990 version of the regulation was arbitrary and capricious.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurance company had been taxed on certain on its property. Later, the statutes which provided the authority for those taxes were declared unconstitutional. The insurance company sought refunds of the taxes at issue. Although the revenue cabinet refunded a portion of the taxes paid, refund of the majority was denied because the revenue cabinet believed that the two-year statute of limitations of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 134.590 barred those claims. The appellate court held that the two-year statute of limitations applied to the suit for a refund and that the doctrines of equitable recoupment and set-off were not available to the insurance company. The tax imposed by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 136.320 in its operation, effect, and incidents was an ad valorem property tax. Therefore, the two-year statute of limitations contained in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 134.590 was applicable. The case law did not support the application of equitable recoupment in the circumstances urged by the insurance company. Set-off was in the nature of a defense but was one available to the taxing authority and thus unavailable to the insurance company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury in the Campbell Circuit Court (Kentucky) convicted defendant of third-degree burglary as an accomplice, enhanced by a finding that he was a persistent felony offender in the first degree. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the presentation of evidence at trial, the Commonwealth moved to amend the indictment to add as an alternate theory that defendant was complicit to another's commission of the robbery. Defendant was convicted only under the complicity instruction. The appellate court held that the trial court erred in giving the complicity instruction sought by the Commonwealth. Defendant did not waive his right to be proceeded against only by indictment, so the only allowable departure from the indictment was that contemplated by Ky. R. Crim. P. 6.16. The distinction between third degree burglary and complicity to third degree burglary was the sort of amendment that was prohibited because it involved a modification at trial in the elements of the crime charged. This was prejudicial per se. By convicting defendant of complicity to burglary, the jury necessarily acquitted him of the primary offense. Accordingly, he could not have been retried on the charge of third degree burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction of complicity to third degree burglary was reversed. The appellate court ordered that defendant could not have been retried on the charge of third degree burglary, and that the Commonwealth was required to seek an indictment on the complicity charge from a grand jury or a proper waiver of indictment by defendant before retrial on that charge.</SPAN></P>

The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents claimed that the circuit court ignored Scott v. Scott, 80 S.W.3d 447 (Ky. App. 2002), which required a grandparent seeking visitation under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 405.021 to prove by clear and convincing evidence that harm would result to the child from the parents' limitation of grandparent visitation. The appellate court overruled Scott because it set an unnecessarily strict and unworkable standard. Under the new standard, the grandparent had to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the requested visitation was in the best interest of the child. Some factors the circuit court had to consider were the nature and stability of the relationship between the child and the grandparent; the potential detriments and benefits to the child from visitation; the effect visitation would have on the child's relationship with the parents; the physical and emotional health of all the adults involved; and the child's wishes and preferences. Use of the clear and convincing standard was constitutionally required because such cases involved the fundamental right of parents to raise their children as they saw fit without undue interference from the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinance provided for regulation of sexually-oriented businesses and their employees, aimed at controlling the alleged negative, secondary effects associated with such businesses. Defendant was criminally charged for various ordinance violations. He first claimed the district court erred by not analyzing McCracken County, Ky., Ordinance No. 2000-4, &sect; VII(b) pursuant to a strict scrutiny standard. However, since &sect; VII(b)'s ban on nudity was content-based, it did not fit squarely under the U.S. Supreme Court's Barnes and Pap's A.M. analysis, and &sect; VII(b) was properly analyzed pursuant to an intermediate level standard of review. The appellate court did agree with defendant's claim that if intermediate scrutiny was the appropriate standard of review, the case nonetheless had to be remanded to the district court in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Alameda Books. Defendant's unrebutted evidence was sufficient to cast doubt on the fiscal court's pre-enactment rationale for &sect; VII(b), but because Alameda Books had not yet been rendered at the time of the evidentiary hearing, remand to the district court was necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for a violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 250.489(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the bill which enacted Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 250.489(1), the legislature enacted Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 250.482 to define &quot;approved container.&quot; However, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 250.482 stated that it was only applicable to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 250.42-250.488. The trial court ruled that because of this error, an &quot;approved container&quot; was not defined, and thus Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 250.489(1) was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court held that courts consistently rejected reliance on a compiler's error to strike down or otherwise aid in interpreting a statute. Such an error did not vitiate a statute where its fair intent could have been gathered from the whole text. When the legislature amended Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 250.482 to include the definition of approved container, and at the same time, declare it illegal to possess anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container, it intended the definition to apply to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 250.489. The error committed by the compiler of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 250.489 by giving it a number outside the scope of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 250.482 did not render unconstitutional an otherwise constitutional statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant argued that the consensus procedure for processing coal-workers' pneumoconiosis claims denied him a meaningful opportunity to be heard, and that the exclusion of additional supporting x-ray evidence violated his due-process rights. The appellate court held that the due-process rights included the right to present relevant, probative evidence in support of one's claim and in rebuttal of adverse evidence. The exclusion of additional x-ray evidence unduly burdened the claimant's right to challenge the outcome of the consensus procedure. As x-ray reading was nearly as much art as science, and as reasonable differences of opinion among experts were common, cross-examination did not afford a reliable means of exposing a reading's weaknesses. Additional expert opinion was the only meaningful evidence available to a party who wished to challenge consensus readings. To the extent that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316 and the regulations promulgated thereunder precluded the use of additional x-ray evidence in rebuttal in a coal-worker's pneumoconiosis claim, they violated the parties' due-process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ky. Const. &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a passenger in a car stopped for an equipment violation. Both defendant and the driver were asked for identification. Due to the time of day of the stop and heavy dispatching traffic, it took approximately 20-30 minutes to run the background check on defendant's driver's license. When completed, the background check showed defendant was wanted on an outstanding warrant. Defendant was arrested and during a search incident to the arrest, individual packages of crack cocaine were found. On appeal, defendant asserted that &quot;but for&quot; his illegal detention while waiting for the background check results, the cocaine would never have been found. The court disagreed, holding that (1) the &quot;but for&quot; test did not apply where an intervening circumstance sufficient to dissipate any taint caused by prior unlawful conduct occurred; (2) the lawful arrest based on an arrest warrant was a sufficient intervening circumstance to remove any taint of an illegal detention of defendant; and (3) defendant failed to present evidence to support his claim that he was a victim of racial profiling, and even if he was such a victim, it would not require suppression of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An officer approached the truck defendant was in when it was parked on the roadside at 3:30 a.m. The appellate court held the officer's community caretaking function let him approach the vehicle with no suspicion of criminal activity. The driver's nervous, evasive behavior, the time of night, and the officer's detection of the odor of ether coming from an article in the truck's bed gave the officer reasonable, articulable suspicion allowing a request for the driver's license, and this brief detainment's scope was reasonably related to its justification. When the officer was told by dispatch of possible drug activity related to the driver, saw the driver acting suspiciously around the article in the truck's bed, and, when the officer asked for consent to search the truck, the driver became excited and began walking toward the officer while &quot;flapping his arms,&quot; combined with the fact that the officer was confronting two individuals by himself in the middle of the night, the officer could handcuff the driver and put him in a police car. The truck's owner had full authority to let the police search it, and that authority extended to the suspicious article in the truck's bed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The horse finished first in two races, and was given routine urine tests after each race. Its urine tested positive for flunixin, an anti-inflammatory drug, which violated 811 Ky. Admin. Regs. 1:090, &sect; 4(1). The owner had the second sample from each race re-tested; all results were positive for flunixin. The appellate court held that the KHRA's decision was not arbitrary, as it was supported by substantial evidence; though the owner's expert pointed out the absence of flunixin metabolites in the horse's urine, another expert opined that the absence of metabolites indicated that the flunixin may have been given immediately before the race. The appellate court rejected the owner's claim that the chain of custody was broken, as it was unnecessary to establish a perfect chain of custody and the evidence showed there was no tampering. The &quot;trainer responsibility rule&quot; (811 Ky. Admin. Regs. 1:090) was constitutional. There was no double jeopardy violation, as that doctrine did not apply to civil actions. 811 Ky. Admin. Regs. 1:090, &sect; 4(1), which outlawed flunixin for harness horses but not thoroughbreds, did not violate equal protection principles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer stopped defendant's vehicle after he noticed that the vehicle did not have a light illuminating its rear license plate.

Defendant gave his consent and when officers searched the car, they found 10 bags containing methamphetamine. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the drugs, and the trial court granted his motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While the driver was attempting to pass a slow moving van, the van accelerated.

The appellate court held that traveling at a possible speed of 10 miles per hour over the posted speed limit and failing to complete a pass before entering a no-passing zone constituted nothing more than ordinary negligence. Therefore, punitive damages were not available. The trial court's admonition cured any prejudice resulting from the driver's counsel's statements in closing argument.

Const. &sect;&sect; 2, 27, 28, 29. The appellate court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 67C.135(3) was not prey to invalidation by the courts because it included sufficient criteria for drawing the districts. Because the fiscal court had no power or discretion as to the creation of the initial districts, it was not arbitrary to require its approval of the plan without permitting it to make further refinements after-the-fact.</SPAN></P>

Addressing appellants' remaining claims, the court held that: (1) the sanitation district's committee did not act arbitrarily in approving the acquisition of the property owners' land; (2) the taxpayer failed to state a violate claim of fraud because she did not show reliance; and (3) the sanitation district was not required to submit a draft plan to a regional planning commission or comply with the Clean Water Act prior to initiating condemnation.</SPAN></P>

The state revenue cabinet appealed and the cable television company cross-appealed the trial court's determination that the issues presented were purely questions of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state revenue cabinet issued property tax assessments on the cable television company's property. The cable television company protested, but the state revenue cabinet upheld them. The cable television company appealed to the state tax appeals board. An expert witness testified for the cable television company that the state revenue cabinet's assessments included improper valuations. The state tax appeal board ultimately set aside the assessments. The state revenue cabinet lowered its original valuation and argued to the trial court that the fair cash value of the cable television company's operating property was the total business enterprise value shown in the appraisal of the expert witness. The trial court reviewed the issue de novo and upheld the state tax appeals board's decision. On appeal, the appellate court found that the state revenue cabinet's valuation was proper since it assessed the relevant property, the operating tangible property and the franchise, by its fair cash value as a unit. On the cable television company's cross-appeal, it found that the trial court properly used a de novo standard of review and that the assessments were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee juvenile was charged with felony offenses, and because the charges involved the use of a firearm, the juvenile was subject to transfer to circuit court for trial as an adult. Subsequently, the Jefferson Circuit Court, Kentucky, denied a writ of prohibition, wherein appellant Commonwealth requested that the circuit court prohibit the juvenile court from ordering discovery, prior to a transfer hearing. The Commonwealth sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court held the Kentucky Rules of Criminal Procedure did not dictate the timing and scope of discovery in a juvenile transfer hearing. The circuit court ruled that discovery was available pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 610.342. Even though it believed &sect; 610.342 violated the separation of powers doctrine, because it affected matters of practice and procedure, the circuit court concluded &sect; 610.342 was not an unreasonable encroachment on the judiciary. The appellate court rejected the circuit court's ruling. The appellate court held that only the Kentucky Rules of Criminal Procedure, applicable to preliminary hearings, applied in a juvenile transfer hearing pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 635.020(4). As such, Ky. R. Crim. P. 3.07 controlled, and the juvenile was not entitled to complete discovery until probable cause was established. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 610.342 was not a rule of discovery, indeed if it had been, the appellate court would have been constrained to declare it an unconstitutional encroachment on the powers of the judiciary pursuant to Ky. Const. &sect; 116, which reserved the power to prescribe rules of practice and procedure to the Kentucky Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the McLean Circuit Court (Kentucky) denied defendant's motion to suppress, he entered a conditional plea of guilty to trafficking in a controlled substance within 1,000 yards of a school, possession of a controlled substance in the first degree (methamphetamine), possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, and cultivation of marijuana, five or fewer plants, while in the possession of a firearm. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Officers learned that a man subject to an outstanding arrest warrant was living with defendant, went to defendant's home, knocked on the door, and were told to come in. Marijuana cigarettes and firearms were in plain view in the living room. Defendant claimed only he and his companion were in the home, but officers discovered a third man; they arrested all three. Police found marijuana growing in a bedroom closet, drug paraphernalia and firearms in the bedrooms, and methamphetamine in a container in the kitchen. Defendant claimed the trial court erred by ruling that the evidence seized from the bedrooms was admissible under the &quot;safety check&quot; exception to the warrant requirement and that seizure of drugs from the container in the kitchen was a proper &quot;search incident to arrest.&quot; The appellate court disagreed. The presence of firearms, drugs, and persons suspected of criminal activity constituted a &quot;'serious and demonstrable potentiality for danger&quot; justifying a &quot;safety check&quot; search. And as the kitchen counter was within the immediate area where defendant might have gained possession of destructible evidence, the search of the container was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee landowners sued appellant corporation in the circuit court for trespass and nuisance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners alleged injury to their properties as the result of the corporation depositing thereon minute quantities of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The appellate court found that the five-year statute of limitations period of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.120 applied, and that the statute did not bar the landowners' claims. Further, the federal discovery rule applied to the property damage actions with the necessary implication that the landowners, if they had a viable cause of action, were entitled to recover damages for injuries incurred outside of the five-year limitation period preceding the filing of their complaint. However, the landowners could not recover damages under a negligent trespass theory, as they failed to establish that their properties suffered any injury as a consequence of the trespass. Additionally, the permanent nuisance claim failed, as there was no rational basis to find that the discharge of minute quantities of PCBs onto the landowners' properties resulted in any interference with their use and enjoyment of the properties. Finally, the punitive damages award was the result of passion and prejudice resulting from counsel's improper argument.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) affirmed a penalty assessed against appellant mining company (miners) by appellee, the Commonwealth, as a result of a post-mining land use violation. The miners' motion to alter, amend, or vacate the judgment was also denied. The miners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The miners challenged the judgment entered, first arguing that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 350.0301 and 405 Ky. Admin. Regs. 7:092 were invalid and unconstitutional because they denied them due process and equal protection by requiring prepayment of a penalty assessment as a condition precedent to obtaining a formal hearing regarding that very assessment. The appeals court agreed that this impermissibly erected a monetary bar to the fundamental due process right to a hearing. Once a violation was determined, the opportunity to address the fine or penalty flowing from that violation came only at the price of prepayment of the subject matter of the challenge. This bifurcated hearing process did not satisfy fundamental due process. Further, prior to being able to complete restoration of the land in question to use for hay land/pasture or forestry land according to the terms of its original permit plan, a third party built a house on the permit site. There was literally nothing that the miners could do to prevent the construction. The Commonwealth nevertheless issued its noncompliance and cessation order. Such action without a hearing was unreasonable and arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the officer was hired, he said he was a member of the Marine Corps Reserves and was meeting his attendant obligations.

The council could not revoke his law enforcement certification for falsification of information to maintain certified status unless he was separated from his job for that reason, under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15.386(4)(b). The record only showed his voluntary resignation for personal reasons, which normally resulted in a certification being placed in inactive status, under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15.386(3). The officer was not given notice or an opportunity to be heard regarding his alleged misconduct, nor did he waive those minimal due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded for the trial court to order the law enforcement council to reinstate the officer's law enforcement certification to inactive status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by entering the PFO conviction, as he neither pled guilty to nor was found guilty of such charge. The appellate court held that, upon defendant's motion to plead guilty to burglary and handgun possession, the trial court held a hearing where it engaged in a thorough Boykin colloquy with defendant concerning the two charges. However, the record further revealed that, at no time did the trial court ever engage in a similar discussion concerning the PFO. Instead, the trial court entered a guilty plea to the PFO charge in spite of defendant's refusal to do so himself. By entering a judgment summarily convicting and sentencing appellant as a PFO, the trial court denied defendant the right to exercise the full panoply of the relevant protections, which due process guaranteed in state criminal proceedings. The court's action was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the context of a charge against appellee motorist for driving on a suspended license, a district court ordered appellant transportation cabinet to reinstate the motorist's driver's license. The Graves Circuit Court (Kentucky) affirmed that order. The transportation cabinet appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The motorist's license had been suspended in Florida due to driving under the influence (DUI) convictions. The trial court found that the Commonwealth was unable to adequately prove the sufficiency of the Florida DUI convictions, and that the Florida law requiring permanent revocation of the motorist's license was unconstitutional because it was enacted after his conviction for DUI 4th and after he had been issued a Kentucky license. The appellate court ruled a district court was a court of limited jurisdiction and was allowed to exercise original jurisdiction only as provided by the general assembly. A district court did not have jurisdiction to review the transportation cabinet's denial of a driver's license, or to order the transportation cabinet to issue or reinstate an administratively revoked license. Rather, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 186.580(2) vested such jurisdiction in the circuit court. Furthermore, the transportation cabinet was not even a party to the action at the time the district court entered its order. The district court thus erred when it ordered the transportation cabinet to reinstate the motorist's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment which affirmed the order by the district court was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the circuit court with directions to enter an order vacating the district court's order to the extent that it required the cabinet to reinstate the motorist's driver's license.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant to time in prison, most of which was probated. Thereafter, defendant moved the trial court for pretrial diversion. Although defendant was eligible for pretrial diversion under the applicable statutory law, his trial counsel informed the trial court that the Commonwealth's attorney refused to recommend that defendants participate in pretrial diversion programs. The Commonwealth refused to make a recommendation on pretrial diversion, even though it was statutorily required to do so, because it was following a pretrial diversion protocol that permitted the prosecutor to categorically deny all defendants access to the pretrial diversion program simply by failing to provide a recommendation to the trial court. The trial court denied defendant's motion for pretrial diversion. After that ruling was entered, the appellate court found the denial of defendant's pretrial diversion request had to be vacated and the case had to be remanded so that the Commonwealth could provide a recommendation. It also found that the protocol was unconstitutional since it conflicted with the pretrial diversion statutes.</SPAN></P>

The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city annually levied ad valorem taxes based upon real property assessments of the county property valuation administrator. As a result, the city was required under Kentucky statutory law to satisfy certain prerequisites before increasing the real property tax rate for any given year. The real property owners argued the city failed to timely satisfy such prerequisites for two different tax years. They sought reimbursement for their alleged overpayment. The city denied their claim. The real property owners then filed a class action lawsuit in the trial court. The city moved to dismiss, claimed that the Kentucky Board of Tax Appeals was vested with exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute, and claimed the real property owners had failed to first exhaust their administrative remedies. After the trial court dismissed the lawsuit, the appellate court found that the city was not an agency of the state for the purpose of the statutes establishing and implementing the Kentucky Board of Tax Appeal, that the Board did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the action, and that the real property owners exhausted their administrative remedies when they sought a refund from the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child told her mother the father had sexually abused her. The appellate court held a licensed clinical social worker was not qualified to state an opinion on the child's psychological symptoms or diagnoses, including whether they indicated sexual abuse. An amendment to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 600.020(47) including a licensed clinical social worker in the definition of &quot;qualified mental health professional&quot; did not indicate the general assembly's intention that such a person be qualified as an expert for all purposes. Interpreting the statute to allow a licensed clinical social worker to state an opinion on a psychological diagnosis or symptoms would unconstitutionally usurp the power of the judiciary to decide in a given case whether a proposed expert witness was qualified and would assist the trier of fact. The child's statements to her mother admitted as excited utterances were not admissible given the lack of evidence of the child's state of mind when she made the statements and the remoteness of the original startling event.</SPAN></P>

The Kenton Circuit Court (Kentucky) declared the taxes unconstitutional, but denied class certification and ruled that the councilwoman's entitlement to a refund was governed by Ky. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1999, the city levied a tax of $ 75 per mobile home situated within the confines of the city, and a tax of $ 60 for the provision of life-squad and other emergency but non-fire related services for each residential unit or lot and each business unit within the corporate limits of the city. Appellants maintained they were immune from the councilwoman's suit, that she lacked standing to challenge the mobile-home taxes, and that the life-squad taxes were valid. The councilwoman contended that the trial court erred when it refused to certify a plaintiff class. The appellate court found that both sides were entitled to some relief. It agreed with appellants that the councilwoman did not have standing, either as a taxpayer or as a council member, to challenge the mobile-home taxes, and agreed with her that her challenge of the life-squad taxes should have been certified as a class action. The affected taxpayers were too numerous to permit joinder, their interest in declaratory relief was common, their entitlement to it involved common questions of law and fact, and the councilwoman could adequately represent their interest.</SPAN></P>

The Bullitt Circuit Court (Kentucky) entered judgment in favor of the Commonwealth and the homeowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1999, a homeowner pled guilty to violating Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 506.080 by facilitating her husband's crime of cultivating marijuana. A few months later, the homeowner and her husband divorced and the homeowner was awarded the marital residence. The homeowner made payments on two mortgages until early 2001 when she defaulted on the second mortgage and the house was sold at public auction. Immediately thereafter, the Commonwealth moved for forfeiture of almost $ 55,000 of the sale proceeds, the amount remaining after satisfaction of the first mortgage. The appellate court held that (1) because the homeowner's husband pled guilty to felony cultivating and the evidence established that the homeowner facilitated that crime, the trial court ruled correctly that the property was subject to forfeiture; (2) the Commonwealth's action was not barred by the statute of limitations; (3) as the proponent of the forfeiture, the Commonwealth had the burden of proving the forfeiture's propriety; and (4) the trial court erred by ordering the forfeiture without considering whether it was proportionate, given the homeowner's crime and her post-offense payments on her mortgages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant parents appealed an order by the Henderson Circuit Court (Kentucky) that awarded appellee grandparents visitation with their daughter, claiming that award, pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 405.021, was an unconstitutional interference with their right to raise their child as they saw fit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court presumed that the child would ordinarily benefit from contact with his or her grandparents and that grandparents and grandchildren normally had a special bond that could not be denied. The appellate court held that when the trial court engaged in a presumption contrary to the wishes of the parents and granted their decision no deference, it infringed on the parents' fundamental right as parents to raise their daughter as they saw fit. The result was an unconstitutional application of Kentucky's grandparent visitation statute,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 405.021. Grandparent visitation could only be granted over the objections of otherwise fit custodial parents if it was shown by clear and convincing evidence that harm to the child would result from a deprivation of visitation with the grandparents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant moved to suppress evidence against him that was obtained through the use of the Kentucky all schedules prescription electronic reporting system (KASPER) authorized by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.202. After the Fayette Circuit Court (Kentucky) denied defendant's motion, defendant pleaded guilty to several counts of obtaining, and several counts of attempting to obtain, a controlled substance by means of fraud. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While arresting defendant for driving under the influence, a police officer found prescription drug containers for controlled medications and learned that defendant had been charged regarding prescription forgery. A detective then requested a KASPER report which described defendant's prescription activity in Kentucky and showed that defendant had been issued overlapping prescriptions. The detective then questioned defendant's doctors about the prescriptions. The appellate court held that, contrary to defendant's contention on appeal, the detective's use of the KASPER-derived information was not an unreasonable search and seizure under U.S. Const. amend. IV or Ky. Const. &sect; 10. Instead, the administrative search exception to the warrant and probable cause requirements applied because the State had a substantial interest in tracing drug distributions, the KASPER system reasonably advanced that interest, and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.202(6) clearly allowed only limited police inspection and properly restrained officers' discretion. The detective did not violate the confidentiality provisions of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.202(6) since he did not disclose the KASPER report to anyone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a student stole a gun and fired into a group at his high school, killing three students, appellants, decedents' parents, sued appellees, shooter's parents, classmates, gun owner, and school personnel, alleging, inter alia, negligence. The McCracken Circuit Court, Kentucky, dismissed the complaints against the classmates and the school employees and granted summary judgment to the other appellees. The decedents' parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedents' parents argued on appeal, inter alia, that the school personnel were not immune from suit and that genuine issues of material fact existed as to the negligence of (1) the gun owner in the way he stored his gun, (2) the shooter's parents in failing to control their son, and (3) the classmates in not warning someone that the shooter had previously brought guns to school. The appellate court held that qualified official immunity protected the school employees because their allegedly negligent omissions, such as failing to enact safety rules to protect students, involved discretionary functions, and there was no evidence of bad faith. The gun owner was not negligent, as he stored his gun in unloaded condition in a hard plastic case and had no duty to anticipate that the shooter would steal it to shoot students. The shooter's parents were not negligent, as the shooter was not under their control at the time of his illegal acts and there was no evidence that the shooter had previously exhibited violent tendencies toward anyone. The classmates were not liable, as there was no special relationship between the parties, and the incident in question was not foreseeable.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found it was error for the trial court to rely, as a matter of law, on a finding in another case that a consent to search given after an officer stated he had a search warrant was too subject to coercion to be voluntary. The trial court's factual findings failed to address the voluntariness of defendant's consent to search, and additional findings of fact based on a preponderance of the evidence from the totality of all the circumstances as to whether the consent to search was freely and voluntarily given were required.</SPAN></P>

The Franklin Circuit Court, Kentucky, dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the appellate court agreed with the retirement system that that 105 Ky. Admin. Regs. 1:210, &sect;&sect; 6, 7, allowed applications to be submitted to a single medical examiner with an appeal to a hearing officer under 105 Ky. Admin. Regs. 1:210, &sect;&sect; 9, 10. However, the appellate court also found that as Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61.665(2)(e) existed when the employee filed her claim, in the case of denials, the retirement system was required to submit the employee's application to two additional medical examiners. Thus, the employee's request that the other medical examiners review the case was the correct procedure. Skipping the procedure and setting the matter for a hearing was premature and ultra vires. Because the retirement system was following the wrong procedure, the trial court should not have dismissed the complaint and should have remanded for a decision under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61.665(2)(e) by a second, and possibly a third medical examiner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's judgement was reversed and remanded; the retirement system's motion to dismiss was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commonwealth appealed the order of the Todd Circuit Court (Kentucky) which found Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.1432(1)(b)&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and dismissed the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for possession of chemicals or equipment for manufacturing methamphetamine with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine. Defendant filed a motion to declare Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.1432(1)(b)&nbsp;unconstitutional and dismiss the indictment. On appeal, the appellate court noted that under the statute, possession of certain household substances was only illegal if the actor possessed them with the intent to use them to manufacture methamphetamine. Hence, the appellate court concluded the statute was not overbroad as seeking to regulate legally protected conduct. Likewise, the appellate court did not believe the statute was void for vagueness. The appellate court advised that criminal statutes must be sufficiently specific that an individual had fair notice of what conduct was forbidden. As to the statute at issue, although it did not precisely state what conduct would indicate an intent to manufacture methamphetamine, the appellate court believed enough of a standard of conduct was defined that an ordinary person would know what conduct was prohibited and that arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement would not result.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court reversed the order and remanded the matter with directions to reinstate the indictment.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court determined the son spent roughly two years under the care and custody of the grandparents prior to the filing of the action. Accordingly, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's finding of de facto custodianship by the grandparents. In addition, as applied to the parents, the appellate court did not believe the passage of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 403.270(1) significantly altered the preexisting law of custody determination in Kentucky. Further, the appellate court found that a finding of unfitness would have been warranted in the case; thus, it could not be held that the parents' constitutional rights were violated. Finally, the appellate court held the trial court's factual findings were clearly supported by substantial evidence and its custody ruling based on those factual findings was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company argued that assessing sales tax against them was in error, because a post exchange was a federal instrumentality and sales to it were immune from the imposition of state sales tax under 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 107 of the Buck Act, 4 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 105-110. Post exchanges and similar facilities were arms of the government which were essential for the performance of government functions and partook of whatever immunities were provided under the Constitution and federal statutes. The exchange was an instrumentality within the purview of the Buck Act exception. There were no third parties involved in the transaction between the company and the exchange. The state was therefore without authority to tax the sale of canned soft drinks by the company to the exchange for resale to authorized persons. No credible argument could be made that the exchange was not an instrumentality of the federal government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Fayette Circuit Court (Kentucky) entered a final judgment finding appellee former husband was a de facto custodian with regard to appellant former wife's two minor children under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 403.270, and thus, that he had the same standing in a marital separation proceeding as a natural parent. The former wife appealed, and the former husband cross-appealed the award of joint custody to the parties instead of sole custody to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former wife and the former husband married after the former wife gave birth to a child. The parties had a difficult relationship. During one of their separations, the former wife began a relationship with another man. The parties then reconciled, but by then the former wife was already pregnant again. The parties then made a final separation. A temporary joint custody order was entered. Shortly thereafter, a paternity test revealed the former husband was not either child's natural father. The trial court then held a hearing, and after finding the children had an established relationship with the former husband and it would be in their best interests to continue it, ordered joint custody. The trial court made the order after concluding the former husband was a de facto guardian under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 403.270. After judgment was entered accordingly, the appellate court found the husband was not a de facto guardian under the statute, as he was not the primary caregiver for the children. The statute required the caregiver stand in place of the natural parent to be a de facto custodian, and the evidence only showed he had provided some care to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment that the former husband was a de facto custodian of the two minor children under the statute was reversed. As the effect of that ruling was that the former husband did not have the same standing as a natural parent would have in the parties' marital separation proceeding, the cross-appeal denying the former husband sole custody of the children was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

It dismissed the claim against the abutting landowner because it held that the abutting landowner owed no duty to the pedestrian. The court of appeals agreed with the trial court. The pedestrian argued that because when the county government was created and the prior city government was abolished, the county retained a former city ordinance that required an abutting landowner to maintain a sidewalk, liability could be imposed on the landowner and on the county government. The court of appeals disagreed because even though liability could have been imposed on the city, the city no longer existed and the county was immune from suit on the ground of sovereign immunity. The court of appeals also agreed that under the law of the commonwealth, an abutting land owner had no liability to a pedestrian who was injured on a sidewalk. The pedestrian argued that under the jural rights doctrine, her claim could be maintained against the county government. The court of appeals disagreed because the jural rights doctrine did not trump sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Ohio company inquired of a supplier about other roofing companies that could complete a project in its home state. The supplier informed the Kentucky company, and it contacted the Ohio company. The companies negotiated a contract which the Kentucky company declined to execute shortly before the job was to begin, and the Ohio company was provided restitution under the Kentucky company's performance bond. The Ohio company had no office or agent in Kentucky. This was the only contractual relationship the parties had ever had. The Ohio company did not purposefully avail itself of the privilege of acting within Kentucky, as it never traveled or solicited business there. The evidence did not show the Ohio company reached beyond its home state to create continuing relationships and obligations with the Kentucky company. The contract price in the parties' agreement did not qualify as a &quot;substantial connection&quot; with the forum state because jurisdiction was not reasonably imposed on a non-resident defendant based on a contract price which might never reach the forum state.

Because there was no constitutional right to possess chemicals or equipment with the intent of using such to manufacture methamphetamine, the statute could not be attacked on the ground that it was overbroad as attempting to regulate constitutionally permissible conduct. The statute was not overbroad as seeking to regulate legally protected conduct associated with the possession and utilization of over-the-counter drugs for their intended purposes. There was no basis for finding that the statute was unconstitutional as being void for vagueness. The classification of methamphetamine as an illegal substance or dangerous drug was not improper. There was nothing in the statute's language which would prevent an ordinary person of reasonable intelligence from understanding what conduct it prohibited.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee brought an action against his company and two individuals also employed at the company, defendants, alleging that the company had discriminated against him on the basis of disability and that it had retaliated against him for filing a workers' compensation claim. The Clark Circuit Court, Kentucky, awarded the employee compensatory damages for emotional distress and punitive damages. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the appellate court found that the trial court did not err by refusing to grant the company's motion for directed verdict because the jury's determination that the employee was either disabled or regarded as disabled by the company was supported by substantial evidence. Even if he was not in fact disabled, the evidence showed that he was regarded as being unable to work for the company, and hence, was discriminated against on that basis; the company had no legitimate reason for its action, and its action had no rational relationship to whether the employee could perform his duties. The appellate court also found that the jury acted properly in awarding punitive damages since employment discrimination qualified as an intentional tort. Furthermore, the employee met his burden in proving that the company's conduct warranted punitive damages. However, the trial court should have granted the individual defendants' motion to dismiss because their status as fellow employees did not constitute an &quot;employer&quot; within the meaning of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 344.030(2); thus, they could not have been held personally liable under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed in regard to the individual defendants' liability, but was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee parent's action on behalf of a minor, to determine the &quot;No Pass-No Drive&quot; law's, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 159.051, constitutionality was certified as a class action. The Calloway Circuit Court (Kentucky) determined it to be unconstitutional and violative of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). Appellants, Kentucky officials, sought review. Parent cross-appealed in regard to two rulings for officials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The &quot;No Pass-No Drive&quot; law operated to suspend the driver's license of any 16 or 17-year-old student who dropped out of school or was deemed academically deficient. Parent sued and for the most part won. The appellate court held that judicial review under the law was properly limited to clerical errors, not teacher assessments. Procedural due process was not violated because the interest here was a legitimately regulated privilege, not a fundamental right. The Transportation Cabinet's Form TC94-30 regarding parental consent was made to further enforcement of the law; thus it was not impermissible legislating in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13A.130. The circuit court correctly relied on the Family Policy Compliance Office's letter opining that &sect; 159.051 violated FERPA's privacy provisions. But that violation did not operate to strike &sect; 159.051, rather it only related to loss of federal funding. The threat of losing driving privileges was an incentive to stay in school, thus the statute was rationally related to its objective and did not violate substantive due process. Equal protection was not violated because the statute provided for students' different academic abilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgments that the statute neither denied meaningful judicial review nor violated procedural due process, but that it did violate federal law, were affirmed. The judgments that the statute violated substantive due process and equal protection, and that the Transportation Cabinet illegally legislated via memorandum, were reversed. The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The jury in the Jefferson Circuit Court, Kentucky, returned a verdict in favor of appellees. Appellant water company challenged the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedents were riding in a car that crashed into a barricaded construction site where appellant water company was working. Appellant contended that it was a municipal corporation and, as such, could not be liable for punitive damages. Appellees asserted that appellant water company was not in any way, shape or form a municipality or a municipal agent. The general rule was that no punitive damages against a municipality were allowed unless expressly authorized by statute.  Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65.2002 did not expressly authorize punitive damages. Appellant also contended that the trial court erred in its rulings on subsequent remedial measures. The appellate court, however, found no abuse of discretion. Finally, there was no manifest error in the trial court's denial of appellant water company's motion for a mistrial after an employee was asked about placement of a flashing arrow board at the accident scene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed in regard to the trial court's denial of appellant's motion for mistrial, as well as the denial of appellant's motion to exclude evidence of subsequent remedial measures.

The appellate court found that the statute was rationally related to a legitimate state objective and thus did not violate appellant's substantive due process rights.

The whole purpose of the ordinance was to tax regulated public utilities, such as appellee, on top of required ad valorem and franchise taxes authorized under state statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the first case, appellant marina operator leased luxury houseboats to the public. Appellant marina operator collected and remitted sales tax on the rental of the houseboats but did not collect or remit sales and use tax on its sale of gasoline used to power the leased vessels.  Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 139.483 exempted from excise taxes fuel consumed in operation of ships and vessels used in transportation of property or conveyance of persons for hire, but the trial court found the exemption did not apply to appellant marina operator's sale of gasoline. The appellate court agreed that the exemption did not apply because a lessee's principal use of a leased houseboat was not the transportation of property or the conveyance of persons for hire. Section 139.483 was not unconstitutional as applied. In the second case, in which appellant taxpayer claimed its houseboat leases were exempt from sales and use tax, the trial court erred in dismissing the action for failure to pursue administrative remedies because the only issue was the applicability of the &sect; 139.483 exemption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed in the first case because appellant marina operator's sale of gasoline for use in the leased houseboats was not tax exempt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was acquitted on rape charges, and after trial, the court ordered him to pay his court-appointed attorney fees. Under Ky. Rev.

Appellant contended that he could not pay the amount ordered, and that the statute was unconstitutional; thus the court abused its discretion. The appeals court affirmed assessment. A recoupment fee was only assessed after the representation was complete, and only where the defendant could afford to pay a percentage of the defense costs on reasonable terms. All defendants were treated equally, and those who were capable of paying the recoupment fee could have it assessed against them. The fee was not a penalty, but was merely a partial recoupment of the costs expended by the state to protect those in need.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 434.845(1)(c) to be void for vagueness. The Commonwealth appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commonwealth contended that the trial court erred by finding that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 434.845(1)(c) was unconstitutional. The Commonwealth argued that the trial court erred by agreeing with defendant's contention that the statute, as enacted, lacked an essential requirement mandating that the offense of unlawful access to a computer cannot occur unless the alteration, damage or destruction at issue was committed without authorization. Upholding the Commonwealth's argument would result in a situation where both authorized and unauthorized persons could be prosecuted for first-degree unlawful access as a result of the alteration, damage, or destruction of a computer and/or related components and systems, even though the alteration, damage, or destruction could have been caused by an authorized person with the permission or at the request of the computer's owner. The statute was void for vagueness as an authorized user could not ascertain specifically what alteration, damage or destruction was prohibited. Nothing in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 434.845(2) prevented an authorized user from being prosecuted under &sect; 434.845(1)(c) for innocent alterations made in good faith.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, adult entertainment establishments and their employees, sued defendants, challenging the constitutionality of ordinances enacted by defendant county. The ordinances regulated activities within the establishments, personnel qualifications, licensing requirements, and hours of operation. The trial court upheld certain parts of the ordinances and struck down others as unconstitutional. Both parties appealed. The court affirmed in part, upholding the ordinances in their entirety. The provisions of the ordinances were content neutral. Defendant county's interest was in combating the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments. It was not the message of eroticism that was censored but the act that conveyed the message. The line between prohibited conduct and permitted conduct was clearly drawn by the ordinance. No equal protection violation existed concerning advertisement merely because plaintiffs were placed in a different classification than other businesses which sold alcoholic beverages. The classification was rationally related to the unique problems involved in advertising adult entertainment. Stage requirements were not unduly burdensome.</SPAN></P>

The court held in order for the choice of evils defense to be available, appellant was required to show his conduct was necessitated by an imminent threat of injury to his person under circumstances which left him no reasonable and viable alternative, other than violating the law for which he was charged. The court noted appellant did not present evidence that he did not have reasonable alternatives to cultivating marijuana as a means of medical treatment for his physical ailments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner argued that the trial court erred in concluding that subdivision regulations applied to the development of a mobile home park. He argued that the proposed development did not constitute a subdivision within the meaning of the statutes and regulations because he had no intention of selling the divided lots.  Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 100.111(22) was unequivocal. Nothing in the definitions required that divided lots be offered or developed solely for sale in order to constitute a subdivision of property. The statute's intent was to give local government the power to control the subdivision of land in order to protect its citizens in matters of public safety, health, and welfare. The owner had partitioned the property as part of his intent to develop it. The owner had not sought approval for a development, and did not establish a sufficient basis for review that regulations would be unconstitutional. The owner failed formally to apply to the county for approval of his proposed development. The county did not wrongfully induce the owner to act to his detriment. He had access to the statutes and regulations at issue and was chargeable with notice of the proper procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants erected six billboards within 660 feet of a right-of-way of an interstate highway without obtaining a permit from appellee in violation of the Billboard Act (Act), Ky.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee having determined that appellants' billboards were illegal per se. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that appellee's administrative regulations requiring permits did not exceed the authority delegated to appellee because Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 177.860 showed the legislature's intent for appellee to adopt regulations to promote highway safety and preserve the scenic beauty of the area surrounding the highways. The permit requirements were rationally related to the Act's objectives because without them, anyone could erect a billboard that could impair drivers' visibility and destroy the scenic beauty. The court held appellee was permitted to conduct administrative hearings for the benefit of persons aggrieved by its actions under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13B.010-170.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment affirmed.

The trial court denied the motion. &quot;Truant&quot; was a term of common usage, and one which the jury could have been expected to understand without a formal definition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was arrested for suspected operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He was administered a blood alcohol test which indicated a blood alcohol concentration of 0.26. Thereafter, appellant was indicted for DUI III, a felony. Appellant argued that when Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 189A.010 was construed with Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 189A.105, the implied consent statute, an irreconcilable conflict resulted rendering the statutory scheme void-for-vagueness. Appellant insisted that the warning that refusal to submit to the blood alcohol test would have resulted in revocation of his driving privilege was insufficient to inform him, a third time offender, that he could have been subject to a felony conviction and that additional warnings should have been supplemented. The statute addressed strictly the notion of implied consent and the penalty for noncompliance therewith. The statute was not vague as it provided the minimal guidance necessary to avoid arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. Thus, appellant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant kennels challenged the judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) upholding the constitutionality of Jefferson County, Ky., Ordinance No. 46, &sect; 91.075 (1996) requiring that kennel and cattery owners divulge the names and addresses of pet owners to the Department of Animal Control upon request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants were boarding kennels located in Jefferson County, which boarded domesticated dogs and cats. Appellants alleged that Jefferson County, Ky., Ordinance No. 46, &sect; 91.075 (1996) requiring appellants to provide pet owner's name and home address to appellee Department of Animal Control was unconstitutional because it invaded the privacy of the kennel owners and its clients, violated equal protection, and was vague. The public interest in rabies prevention outweighed the privacy interest an individual pet owner boarding his pet in a kennel or cattery had in his home address being furnished to the department. The county fiscal court had the right to enact more stringent rabies prevention measures than those of other counties; thus, the ordinance did not violate the equal protection clause. Also, the ordinance was not impermissibly vague, as a pet owner could readily determine that his pet was required to have a license to be boarded and was on notice that he would receive a warning citation should his unlicensed pet be discovered during a department inspection. Thus, the ordinance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment affirmed; the ordinance requiring appellant kennels to provide the name and address of animals being boarded to prevent rabies was upheld as constitutional because rabies prevention outweighed the privacy interest in owner's home address, the ordinance did not violate equal protection rights, and the ordinance was not impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While police officers were at appellant's house arresting her and another person for shoplifting, the officers noticed a smell of ether coming from the house and saw items that could be used in the manufacture of methamphetamine.

The trial court denied appellant's motion to suppress, and appellant entered a conditional guilty plea to charges of criminal facilitation to the manufacture of methamphetamine and being a persistent felony offender in the second degree. The court affirmed. The court rejected appellant's argument that the search and seizure of the drug evidence was unconstitutional because it was tainted by an illegal arrest. Appellant's arrest for theft was supported by probable cause and authorized under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 433.236(3). Furthermore, even if the arrest had been illegal, the seizure of the evidence was not unconstitutional because it was not a product of the arrest, but was otherwise based on items seen in plain view.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a minor, made a conditional plea of guilty to two felony and three misdemeanor charges, including receiving stolen property, possession of a handgun by a minor, and resisting arrest. Pursuant to his plea agreement he appealed his transfer from juvenile to circuit court and argued that the waiver was invalid because, the waiver statute was constitutionally infirm; he could not be waived on anything less than a clear and convincing standard of proof; the circuit court abused its discretion in finding that the transfer was appropriate; and the refusal to consider a psychological evaluation constituted reversible error. The court held that, while it was axiomatic that a juvenile offender had no constitutional right to be tried in juvenile court, the circuit court had the discretion to order the transfer of appellant as a youthful offender. Appellant's arguments that the circuit court had not articulated the standard of proof in making its transfer decision were unconvincing because the decision comported with traditional notions of due process. Meeting the standard of clear and convincing proof was not required. Any error related to the report was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed a judgment, which transferred appellant, a minor, from juvenile to circuit court as a youthful offender because the transfer statute was constitutionally sound, and the action was not an abuse of the court's discretion where the court's decision was based upon sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals upheld a judgment accepting defendant's conditional guilty plea to trafficking in a controlled substance first degree, with a firearm, possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, and operating a motor vehicle under the influence after refusing to suppress evidence seized from defendant's car in a search conducted at an impoundment lot the day after her arrest. The court held that it was not error to deny her motion to suppress. The court found there was substantial evidence supporting the determination that there was probable cause for a second search of her car. The court did not accept the characterization of the second search as an inventory search rather than as a second automobile probable cause search. The court held that the same probable cause that supported the first search of the car on the highway continued to exist and to support the second search at the impoundment lot. The court noted that when officers had probable cause to believe there was contraband inside an automobile that had been stopped on the road, the officers could conduct a warrantless search of the vehicle, even after it had been impounded and was in police custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged the judgment of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence (DUI), third offense, a Class D felony. Since the court agreed with the trial court's determination that the statute was constitutional, the court affirmed. Appellant argued that the DUI statute violated equal protection laws. There was nothing essentially unjust or unequal in establishing different classifications of multiple offenders based on their level of intoxication. Appellant also argued that the application of the amended statute to his third offense violated the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution. Under the facts of this case, there clearly were no ex post facto implications. Lastly, appellant argued that the statute subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment. Applying a Solem analysis, the court soundly rejected any argument that the punishment he received was grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of his crime, or that the statute, violated the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment as to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sheriff served as tax collector for school taxes within the county under Ky. Rev. Stat.

Appellant was permitted to withhold up to four percent of the investment earnings as a fee under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 134.140(3)(b). Prior to distributing the tax monies appellant deposited some funds into a NOW account and retained the NOW account interest for operating expenses. The public auditor complained. Appellant sought a declaration of rights. The trial court held the NOW account interest income had to be paid. The court affirmed because Ky.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff filed action in the Boyle Circuit Court (Kentucky) against defendants, the state department of corrections and warden, for gender discrimination and retaliation. The jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants on the claim of gender discrimination but in favor of plaintiff on the claim of retaliation. Defendants appealed from the judgment of the circuit court and its post-trial orders, and plaintiff cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a correctional officer, filed an action against defendants alleging gender discrimination and retaliation in contravention of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 344. Plaintiff claimed she was denied promotion based upon her gender and in retaliation for an Equal Employment Opportunity complaint she had filed previously. On appeal and cross-appeals from a decision of the lower court in favor of defendants on the claim of gender discrimination and in favor of plaintiff on claim of retaliation, the court held that plaintiff's suit against defendant, the state department of corrections, was not barred by doctrine of sovereign immunity. Further, the court found that plaintiff established a prima facie case of retaliation, as there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have reasonably inferred that defendants failed to promote plaintiff for retaliatory reasons. However, the court stated that it was wholly unclear as to how the lower court arrived at a figure for attorneys' fees; thus, the court vacated lower court's order awarding attorney's fees to plaintiff. Finally, the court held that plaintiff was permitted to seek punitive damages under ch. 344.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of conviction for sodomy in the Wolfe Circuit Court (Kentucky), alleging that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 197.045(4), 532.043, which became effective after defendant committed her criminal act, constituted the improper application of ex post facto laws by increasing defendant's punishment and limiting defendant's ability to earn good time credit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of sodomy and alleged that the prohibition against ex post facto laws was violated by the imposition of a term of conditional discharge under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.043 and by the conditioning of good time credit upon completion of the sexual offender treatment program under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 197.045(4). The court held that, although both statutes became effective after defendant committed her crime, only the conditional discharge statute constituted an ex post facto law. The term of conditional discharge potentially subjected defendant to a term of imprisonment greater than the maximum sentence applicable at the time of the offense and thus retroactively disadvantaged defendant. However, defendant was sentenced after the effective date of the statute deferring good time credit until after completion of the sex offender program, and thus defendant was not deprived of any previously earned credits, the opportunity to earn good time credits, or the opportunity to qualify for early parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment was affirmed in part because defendant's ability to earn good time credit was only deferred by the retroactively applied statute, but reversed in part because the disadvantage to defendant from the application of the statute requiring a term of conditional discharge, thus potentially increasing defendant's punishment, constituted an ex post facto violation.</SPAN></P>
