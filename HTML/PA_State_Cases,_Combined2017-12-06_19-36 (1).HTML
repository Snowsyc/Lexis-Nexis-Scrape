<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-A facial state constitutional challenge to Pa. Act 192 (2014), which established criminal penalties for the theft of secondary metals, created a civil cause of action for a broad class of challengers to municipal firearm legislation, and authorized attorney fees to successful challengers, was summarily granted under Pa.R.A.P. 1532(b), as it clearly violated the single subject rule of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3; [2]-The single subject rule was violated by the Act because the primary subjects were so disparate that they lacked any clear, common nexus, and amending the Crimes Code was not a unifying subject because it was overly broad; [3]-Act 192 also violated the original purpose requirement of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 because the Act did not retain its original purpose of criminalizing the theft of secondary metal as it moved through the enactment process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The trial court properly found that the qualified constitutional right at issue was the right to enjoyment of private property protected under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 where a zoning ordinance prohibited billboards outright within a township, and the township did not prove a substantial relationship between the exclusion and the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare; [2]-The trial court erred in adopting and affirming a zoning hearing board's rejection of an applicant's proposed billboards as appropriate site-specific relief because, while the record was more than adequate to reject judicial relief under 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11006-A(c) in the form of approval of all elements of the applicant's proposed billboards, the trial court failed to consider whether alternative relief could and should be made available to the applicant with respect to the proposed sites.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand in a dispute regarding defendant assignee of a county's delinquent taxes' ability to collect attorney's and other fees, the Common Pleas Court of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, granted plaintiff class of delinquent taxpayers' (class) summary judgment motion and dismissed the class's claims challenging the assignee's ability to collect attorneys' fees, assignment fees and revival fees. The class appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that the Pennsylvania Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act (MCTLA), 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7101 et seq., had been amended to authorize municipalities to collect reasonable attorneys' fees from delinquent taxpayers retroactive to January 1, 1996 in response to a holding in this case that the assignee could not collect attorneys' fees from delinquent taxpayers. The state's highest court held that the amendment was constitutional. The appellate court held that Pentlong II was binding as to the named class members. The class had not been certified when the MCTLA was amended. Thus, the assignee could collect attorneys' fees from the non-named class members. An assignment of delinquent taxes was not an act in lieu of collecting taxes. The fee to effect such an assignment to a third party was a prothonotary fee incurred to collect the taxes and could be collected by the assignee. There was no necessity element in evaluating what fees could be collected by the county or its assignee. The assignee could also collect revival fees. The revivals that occurred as part of the process to effect the assignment of the liens en masse to the assignee were proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed with respect to the named class members, and with respect to those members, the matter was remanded to the trial court to fashion appropriate relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DEP contended that the applicant's petition for review was barred by her failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The applicant did not dispute that she was able to challenge the DEP's refusal to submit her petition for rule-making to the EQB by appeal to the Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board (EHB) and that the EHB was able to grant the relief which she sought. Indeed, she had filed an appeal with the EHB. Her justification for not exhausting her remedies before the EHB prior to seeking relief in the court was that she had asserted constitutional challenges to the DEP's decision. The court found that, because the applicant's constitutional arguments were challenges to the DEP's application of the statutes to her case, not facial challenges to the statutes as a whole, they were not exempt from the requirement that she was to exhaust her remedy of raising these issues in her EHB appeal before seeking judicial review. Moreover, she did not assert constitutional challenges to all of the grounds on which the DEP based its decision. Therefore, because the applicant did not exhaust her administrative remedy of appeal to the EHB, her petition for review was to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant student sought review of orders from the Common Pleas Court of the County of Bucks (Pennsylvania), which granted post-trial relief to appellee school district and, inter alia, reduced a jury verdict for the student to reflect application of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8553 of the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, and imposed delay damages only on the molded verdict. The matter arose in the student's negligence action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was run over by a school bus that ran off the road due to undisputed driver negligence, resulting in catastrophic injuries that included a partial leg amputation. She filed suit against the district and a jury verdict was entered in her favor. By post-trial orders, the trial court molded the jury verdict, which was over $14 million, to reflect the application of &sect; 8553. Further, delay damages were added to the molded, rather than original, verdict, and sanctions were imposed against the district under Pa.R.C.P. No. 4019. On appeal, the court found no merit to the student's facial and as applied challenges to the Act. Based on judicial precedent, there was no violation of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 or Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 18. Further, there was no violation of the jury trial right under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, or of the equal protection guarantee under a heightened level of scrutiny. The cap also did not violate the separation of powers. The district's purchase of insurance above the cap amount did not constitute a waiver of the cap. A monetary sanction against the district for its failure to disclose the existence of an excess insurance policy was proper under Rule 4019.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Amendments to the Pennsylvania Public Welfare Code affected a number of human services programs administered by the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare.

III, &sect; 3 because all the elements of the Act could be unified under the theme of improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the delivery of human services programs to people in need; (3) the Act did not violate Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxicab companies (TCs) filed an amended petition for review, seeking declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus relief against respondents, a city parking authority (PA) and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC), with respect to their attempt to impose and enforce fines and assessments, and to enforce regulations. The PA and PUC filed preliminary objections (POs)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Six of the seven TCs were partial-rights, non-medallion TCs which received certificates of public convenience from the PUC that authorized them to provide service in certain areas of the city. After authority was transferred from the PUC to the PA and regulations were enacted, the PA attempted to enforce the regulations. The court previously agreed with a TC in its petition for review that the regulations were invalid. However, the PA continued to enforce the regulations, and to demand payment of fines and assessments. The TCs filed their petition for review, and respondents filed multiple POs. The court held that the PUC should have been joined as a necessary party to a particular count. The failure to join indispensable parties to a declaratory judgment claim was fatal under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7540(a). As pre-enforcement review of the regulations was warranted, there was no need to exhaust administrative remedies. Further, the claims satisfied the ripeness test, they were not barred by collateral estoppel, and there was no similar prior pending action. A jurisdictional challenge lacked merit. However, there was no basis to seek fees or costs under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2503(9).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained POs with respect to the failure to join the PUC to a claim, failure to join indispensable parties, and as to the request for fees and costs. The court dismissed a declaratory judgment and related claims that lacked the indispensable parties, directed the PUC to be joined to the other claim, and dismissed the fees and cost request. The remainder of the POs were overruled.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was ordered to cease operation of his business on the property. Appellant challenged the board's decision by appealing to the trial court. The trial court held that the appeal was untimely since appellant failed to file his appeal within 30 days of receipt of the board's decision. The court found error, noting that the board failed to set forth its date of mailing its decision to appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a former public school superintendent, appealed the order of respondent, the Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement Board (Board), which determined that his retirement benefits were forfeited under the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act, 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1313, as a result of his guilty plea to a federal criminal offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pled guilty to violating 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 666(a)(1)(B) by knowingly, intentionally, and corruptly accepting $ 5,000 in connection with influencing and rewarding contracts for the school district for which he was employed. Petitioner was discharged for cause and the Board notified him that his right to receive retirement benefits was subject to forfeiture. At issue was whether the federal crime of theft or bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds under &sect; 666(a)(1)(B) was substantially the same as the crime of bribery in official and political matters under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 4701 to cause forfeiture of petitioner's pension. The court held that although the third elements of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 4701 and 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 666 were not identical, the elements under each statute were substantially the same. The court rejected petitioner's vagueness and excessive punishment challenges to 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1313, noting that the forfeiture of petitioner's pension resulted from a breach of the contract between petitioner and the Board. Thus, the forfeiture of pension benefits was not a punitive forfeiture requiring the application of the gross disproportionality analysis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner trustees sought review of orders from respondent, the Board of Finance and Revenue (Pennsylvania), which upheld the imposition of Pennsylvania income tax (PIT) on all of the income of two inter vivos trusts pursuant to 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 7301(s) and 7302(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two inter vivos trusts were created by a Pennsylvania resident in 1959, which were to be governed, administered, and construed under the laws of Delaware. Further, the sole administrative trustee was located in Delaware. None of the trusts' assets or interests in 2007 were located in Pennsylvania, and the trusts had no income from Pennsylvania sources. However, all of the trusts' discretionary beneficiaries were residents of Pennsylvania in 2007. In that year, the Department of Revenue assessed PIT and interest on all of the income of the trusts. Reassessment was denied, and that decision was administratively affirmed by the Board pursuant to 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 7301(s) and 7302(a). On further review, the court found that reliance on a Department ruling was improper, as it did not apply to the trusts at issue. The court found that the Commerce Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3 was violated by the imposition of PIT in the circumstances. The trusts lacked the required physical presence in Pennsylvania to establish a substantial nexus, and the fair apportionment and reasonable relationship prongs of the four-prong test were also not satisfied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant township sought review of an order from the Common Pleas Court of the County of Erie (Pennsylvania), which granted the request of appellees, an emergency medical service (EMS) provider and two customers, to permanently enjoin the township from enforcing Millcreek, Pa., Ordinance No. 2010-3. The Ordinance, in part, designated a particular EMS company as the exclusive entity to provide EMS services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township board of supervisors enacted the Ordinance, which regulated certain aspects of EMS within the township. The Ordinance expressly designated one company for EMS services. The provider had provided EMS services for 25 years and had contracts with township residents that generated approximately $ 1 million in annual revenue. On the effective date of the Ordinance, appellees sought injunctive relief. A preliminary injunction (PI) was initially issued, and thereafter, a permanent injunction was issued that prevented the township from enforcing the Ordinance. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly determined that the ordinance violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, as it substantially impaired the provider's contracts. Further, the township was unable to justify the ordinance with a significant and legitimate public purpose where it was primarily an attempt to isolate a revenue stream and eliminate competition. The issuance of the ex parte PI under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1531(a) was warranted to avoid irreparable harm. Moreover, any objection to the PI was waived by the 17-month delay in challenging it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner hospitals filed a petition for review against respondent, the Department of Public Welfare of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (DPW), which challenged certain aspects of the implementation of 2010 Pa. Laws 336 (Act 49), which amended the Public Welfare Code, 62 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 101-1503. Intervenor hospital association (HA) opposed the petition, and the DPW and the HA filed preliminary objections to the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In resolving the preliminary objections to the hospitals' claims, the court found that as the hospitals' disputes were aimed toward action or inaction by the DPW that was regulatory/legislative in nature, the review afforded by 67 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1102(a) was not applicable. There was nothing in a Letter Agreement between the DPW and the HA that could support any claim for a violation of Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, such that the hospitals' challenge on that basis could not survive. There did not appear to be any provision in 62 P.S. &sect; 443.1(1.2) that could reasonably be construed as nullifying, ex post facto, hospitals' rights to enforce acceleration provisions of their managed care organizations contracts in effect as of June 30, 2010. Further, the facts did not sufficiently support a claimed violation of 42 C.F.R. &sect; 433.68. However, the hospitals' claim that the manner in which managed care organizations distributed the &quot;pass through&quot; of enhanced capitation payments violated federally approved State Plan amendments under 62 P.S. &sect;&sect; 443.1(1.1)(ii) and 803-G survived challenge, as sufficient facts were alleged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the DPW's preliminary objections. However, preliminary objections by the HA were sustained to three claims, leaving only one surviving claim regarding the enhanced capitation payments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A matter was before the court on remand from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Petitioner County Deputy Sheriffs' Association (Union) filed a petition with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board arguing that they were policemen for collective bargaining purposes under the Policemen and Firemen Collective Bargaining Act (Act 111) under &sect; 2162 of the Municipal Police Education and Training Law (MPETL) and 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 103.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board found that the Union was certified as the exclusive representative of the deputy sheriffs' collective bargaining unit and that the deputy sheriffs' primary duties related to County's court operations, including providing court security, serving process for the courts, executing warrants for the courts and transporting prisoners for the courts. The Board found they were not police officers under Act 111. The court found that the deputy sheriffs were not police officers within the meaning of Act 111. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Board erred in applying the two-pronged test in determining that the deputy sheriffs were not police officers within the purview of Act 111. However, the Supreme Court also acknowledged that the trial court had not considered the County's constitutional claims. On review, the court held the deputy sheriffs would be improperly singled out for disparate treatment, as a sub-classification for collective bargaining purposes, from all other deputy sheriffs in the Commonwealth based on the provisions in the Crimes Code and the MPETL when the Constitution made no such distinction and such disparate treatment was prohibited.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board's order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Office of the Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor (LG) (OLG), petitioned for review of a final determination of the Pennsylvania Office of Open Records (OOR) directing the OLG to disclose to respondent, a requester, the home address of an OLG employee and all agency-issued e-mail addresses for the LG under the Pennsylvania Right to Know Law (RTKL), 2008 Pa. Laws 6, 65 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 67.101 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court held that there was no constitutional privacy right under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 8 in one's home address. The current RTKL's personal identification information (PII) exception under &sect; 708(b)(1)(ii) (65 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 67.708(b)(1)(ii)) of the RTKL did not require the OOR to balance personal security interests against the benefits of disclosure. The balancing test used under the prior RTKL did not apply. The affidavit of the OLG's chief security officer did not prove that home addresses should be added to the three items of personal information that were reasonably likely to result in identity theft and fraud. The OLG did not show that the disclosure of an individual's home address would be reasonably likely to result in a substantial and demonstrable risk of harm to the personal security of the employee. The LG's secondary, government-issued e-mail addresses were exempt from disclosure under the PII exception, &sect; 708(b)(6)(i)(A) (&sect; 67.708(b)(6)(i)(A)) of the RTKL, even though they were used to conduct agency business, as they were personal to the LG. The requester could request e-mails from that account if they were not exempt from disclosure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The final determination was affirmed to the extent that it provided access to the home address of an OLG employee, but reversed as to the portion providing for the disclosure of all agency-issued e-mail addresses for the LG.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The constable claimed that under 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1901(a), he was exempt as a governmental or quasi-governmental entity from paying the registration fee. The court held that a constable was not a governmental or quasi-governmental entity. A constable, created by statute, had no authority to act on behalf of the government unit in which he worked. 44 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7142(e) expressly provided that a county was not to be liable for the acts of a constable through the doctrine of respondeat superior. The constable had no authority to register a vehicle on behalf of the political subdivision in which he worked. He bought the vehicle on his own and determined on his own that he would maintain it solely for work. Furthermore, because the constable was not entitled to the fee exemption, the exemption could not be an emolument of office under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 27. Finally, the DOT was not equitably estopped from requesting a registration fee and from revoking the plate. The trial court found that given the constable's testimony that he considered certain equipment necessary to perform his duties, he would have purchased the equipment in any event.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered the forfeiture of the PO's personal residence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth filed its forfeiture petition against the PO's property, seeking forfeiture because, inter alia, drug activity had occurred there, drugs and money were seized from the residence, and arrests were made pursuant to the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 780-101 - 780-144. After a hearing, the trial court granted the forfeiture request. It found that the PO failed to meet her burden under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6802(j) of showing that she was an innocent owner. On appeal, the court noted that the PO was indigent and had appeared at the forfeiture hearing pro se. Moreover, she was not informed that she had a right to a jury trial at any stage of the proceedings before the trial court. Although there was a jury trial right under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, the trial court found that the PO waived that right under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1007.1(a). However, the court disagreed and held that Rule 1007.1 did not apply, as the due process concerns were not satisfied. Rather, any such jury trial waiver had to be knowing, intelligent, and on the record, as required under Pa. R. Crim. P. 620. As there was no such waiver, the matter could not proceed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order of the trial court and remanded the matter for a new hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant City of Philadelphia sought review of the grant of summary judgment by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) in favor of two members of the Board of Revision of Taxes (BRT). The members of the BRT claimed that they were public officers within the meaning of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 27 and that the City had no authority to reduce their salaries until the completion of their current terms of office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The BRT members agreed to relinquish their real property assessment responsibilities. Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding and executed by the Mayor's Office of the City, the Finance Director's Office of the City, and the BRT, responsibility for assessments would be vested in the Finance Director or his designee. The members of the BRT sought to enjoin the referendum. The BRT members then filed suit contending that the City lacked authority to eliminate the BRT's appellate function and also complained about the reduction in salary. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the members were public officers within the meaning of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 27. The members of the BRT, even when stripped of their authority to perform assessments, met the criteria set forth in Richie. Their duties were set by statute and the members served for a set term. Further, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the BRT's duties were quasi-judicial in character. Additionally, the BRT's services were an essential part of the real estate taxation system. Whether it made sense to prohibit a mid-term reduction in salary when duties were reduced, was not for the Court to determine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In tax assessment appeals raising constitutional challenges, a School District sought review of the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County (Pennsylvania) which reversed an increase in the assessed value of two parcels based on a determination that the School District intentionally and selectively exercised its right to appeal, thereby violating the taxpayer's entitlement to uniform treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A taxpayer owned an apartment complex situated on two parcels of property located in the School District. The School District contested the property assessments. The Board increased the value of each parcel. The taxpayer's properties were the only potentially under-assessed properties recommended for appeal by the School District. That was because of the size of the potential under-assessment. Given that recommendation, it was difficult to give much weight to the taxpayer's &quot;arbitrary and capricious selection&quot; argument. However, it was easy to envision a rational basis for the School District taking the appeals. Judicious use of resources to legally increase revenue was a legitimate governmental purpose. Additionally, the School District proved that the taxpayer's properties were in fact under-assessed. The taxpayer, however, did not prove that any other property was under-assessed. Thus, the taxpayer failed to prove that other properties were situated similarly to its properties. The trial court erred in concluding that the School District's decision to appeal only the taxpayer's assessments constituted deliberate, purposeful discrimination in violation of the Uniformity Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent parking authority filed a motion to dismiss the petition filed by petitioners, a group of taxicab companies, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Petitioners filed a motion for summary relief. Petitioners' suit challenged the Parking Authority Law, 53 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5707(b), as being unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners contended that &sect; 5707(b) was unconstitutional because it did not impose any limitations on defendant's exercise of discretion in its activities of setting its annual budget and fee schedule. Petitioners asserted that &sect; 5707(b) effected a taking without due process of law because it deprived them of the opportunity for a hearing on the amount of licensing fees they must pay to defendant in order to stay in business and that the fees were excessive and confiscatory. The court held that &sect; 5707(b) was unconstitutional because the Pennsylvania General Assembly failed to establish standards directing respondent's exercise of discretion in deciding how much to spend each year to regulate common carriers providing taxicab and limousine service in Philadelphia. Additionally, the General Assembly failed to give respondent standards to guide or restrain it in setting fees in any fashion whatsoever. Because &sect; 5707(b) lacks standards to guide the establishment of an annual budget and fee schedule, the court held that it delegated legislative power to respondent, in violation of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled respondent's preliminary objections and granted, in part, petitioners' motion for summary relief by declaring the particular section of the Parking Authority Law at issue unconstitutional and unenforceable. The court enjoined respondent from taking any action with regard to petitioners under the statute. The court denied the remainder of petitioners' motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant firearm licensee sought review of an order from the Common Pleas Court of the County of Berks (Pennsylvania), which overruled and denied his appeal from a decision of appellee, a county sheriff. The sheriff had revoked the licensee's concealed carry license pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6109(e)(1)(i) of the Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act of 1995, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 6101-6127.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff previously issued a license to the licensee. Two years later, the sheriff revoked the license upon finding that the licensee was a &quot;person whose character/reputation indicated danger to public safety.&quot; The licensee filed an appeal with the trial court. An evidentiary hearing on the merits was held, whereupon the trial court denied the appeal. On further review, the court found that the evidentiary rulings under Pa. R. Evid. 405 and the interpretation of &sect; 6109(e)(1)(i) were proper. Additionally, the licensee's constitutional challenges failed. The licensure requirement of &sect; 6109 did not violate the right to bear arms under U.S. Const. amend. II and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. Although the licensee was entitled to procedural due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 11, and the revocation notice was inadequate, he failed to establish demonstrable prejudice such that relief was not warranted. Further, the exigency of the situation allowed for no pre-deprivation hearing, and the trial court's hearing cured the lack of a post-deprivation hearing. Lastly, &sect; 6109(e)(1)(i) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant, proceeding pro se, petitioned for review of an order of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (UCBR) affirming the decision of a referee to deny claimant unemployment compensation benefits. The UCBR found that claimant was ineligible for benefits because claimant's work for a Jewish day school (employer) did not constitute &quot;employment&quot; under the Unemployment Compensation Law, 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;753(l)(4)(8)(a)(ii).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The definition of employment did not include service performed for certain religious organizations. Because the second prong of the statute, which required an organization to be operated or controlled by a church, had previously been declared unconstitutional, the commonwealth court limited its inquiry to whether the employer was operated primarily for religious purposes so that the claimant's work as a cook at the school would not be considered &quot;employment.&quot; Substantial evidence in the record supported the UCBR's conclusion that the employer operated primarily for religious purposes. At the hearing, the employer presented both testimonial and documentary evidence describing the employer's religious mission and curriculum. The head of the school testified that the employer was a tax-exempt religious organization under the Internal Revenue Code and that the employer was &quot;formed with the intent of being a religious organization with the mission of providing a richly fortified Jewish education to its students. Finally, the employer was registered with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a non-profit religious organization.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a charter school, challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County (Pennsylvania), which granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by appellees, a county board of assessment (board) and a school district in the charter school's appeal from the board's denial of its claim for a refund of real estate taxes paid to the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The School Code, 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-1722-A(e)(3), provided a tax exemption for certain entities, including nonprofit corporations and associated nonprofit foundations, that leased property to charter and cyber charter schools. The charter school had paid the real estate taxes claimed and sought a refund of those paid for 2008, 2009, and 2010, based on &sect; 17-1722-A(e)(3). The trial court granted the board and the school district judgment on the pleadings upon discerning that &sect; 17-1722-A(e)(3) expressly differentiated between nonprofit corporations and associated nonprofit foundations, and since &sect; 17-1722-A(e)(3) referred only to associated nonprofit foundations, the charter school, as a nonprofit corporation, was not entitled to the exemption. The court disagreed with the reasoning of the trial court but agreed that the charter school was not entitled to the retroactive application of the exemption set forth in &sect; 17-1722-A(e)(3). The court held that the real estate tax exemption as provided for in &sect; 17-1722-A(e)(3) violated Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 because that constitutional provision protected the vested rights of the county to its tax lien.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, former judge, sought review of the order of respondent, the State Employees' Retirement Board (Board), which affirmed the decision of the State Employees' Retirement System forfeiting his entire accrued pension benefit following his removal from the office of magisterial district judge by the Pennsylvania Court of Judicial Discipline.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was removed from office for inappropriate comments of a sexual nature made toward court staff. On appeal, petitioner asserted that the forfeiture of his pension violated various laws, including ex post facto, due process, and the prohibition of the diminishment of judicial compensation in violation of Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(a). The court disagreed and held that Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 18, Pa. Const. art. VI, and the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3352(a), were clear and are not dependent on how or where the misconduct occurred and simply provided for the forfeiture of compensation and retirement benefits where a judge or magisterial district judge is removed from office for any violation of Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 18. The court noted that the forfeiture provision of Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(b) was mandatory once a judge has been removed from office. The court did find that the Board improperly forfeited petitioner's pension attributable to his military service credit, since that service credit was not earned via his employment with the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the Board insofar as it directed the forfeiture of that part of petitioner's pension attributable to his military service credit. Otherwise, the court affirmed the Board's order directing the forfeiture of the remainder of petitioner's pension attributable to his state service as a magisterial district judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, multiple county tax collection committees (TCCs), filed a motion under Pa.R.A.P. 1532(b) for summary relief against respondent, the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED), wherein they sought a declaratory judgment regarding how to apply an earned income tax (EIT) credit under &sect; 317 of the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6924.317, in particular circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 6924.317 had been interpreted to provide for a &quot;super credit&quot; that allowed a non-resident of Philadelphia who earned income there to apply an EIT credit to a non-Philadelphia school district or other political subdivision's imposition of an EIT. This was based on payments by the non-resident under &sect; 1(a) of the Sterling Act, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15971. The TCCs sought a declaration that such application was incorrect, and a directive that an &quot;apportionment&quot; application of &sect; 6924.317 was proper. In response, the DCED indicated that it had not determined whether to a &quot;super credit&quot; or an &quot;apportionment&quot; application was more appropriate due to lack of clarity in the law. The court noted that in a prior opinion to the former version of &sect; 6924.317, it had approved use of the &quot;super credit.&quot; As the legislature's amendment to that statutory section did not change the language in that regard, the &quot;super credit&quot; was still properly employed. The TCCs' challenge under the Uniformity Clause of Pa. Const. art. 8, &sect; 1 failed, as taxpayers who earned income entirely outside of Philadelphia, and those who earned it both inside and outside of Philadelphia, were not similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court erred in determining that an employee's termination under 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-111(e)(1) violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution where, inter alia, the statute's purpose was not to punish those convicted of the enumerated offenses, and the lifetime ban was clearly rationally related to a non-punitive purpose. However, because 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-111(e)(1) created a lifetime ban for a homicide offense that had no temporal proximity to the employee's present ability to perform the duties of his position and did not bear a real and substantial relationship to the Commonwealth's interest in protecting children, it was unreasonable, unduly oppressive, and patently beyond the necessities of the offense. As a result, it imposed unusual and unnecessary restrictions upon the employee's lawful employment as a fatherhood facilitator with the employer and was unconstitutional as violative of his substantive due process rights as guaranteed by Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former police officer challenged the order of the Allegheny County Common Pleas Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed a decision of appellee borough denying his appeal from a Pension Plan Administrator's (Plan Administrator's) decision that he was not entitled to a vested pension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former police officer was terminated from his job with the borough due to his involvement in a motor vehicle/pedestrian accident that resulted in a death. The borough determined that his conduct constituted conduct unbecoming an officer, a violation of the law, neglect or violation of his official duties, and disobedience of orders. Following his termination, the Plan Administrator for the borough's police pension denied the former police officer's request to have his pension vested due to his employment termination for cause. The trial court upheld that decision, finding that the Plan Administrator properly denied the request to have the former police officer's pension vested under the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The court found no error, concluding that the former police officer had notice, based on the CBA, that if he was discharged for cause he would also lose his pension. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in determining that the borough could retroactively void his pension benefits for events which occurred after the date his pension benefits vested.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County (Pennsylvania) which granted the Office of Attorney General's (Commonwealth) motion for summary judgment in a proceeding under what was commonly known as the Controlled Substances Forfeiture Act, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 6801-6802.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed an answer to the Commonwealth's forfeiture petition admitting that he was the owner of the property &quot;on paper,&quot; but stating that for all intents and purposes the owner was his mother. He also denied that the property was used or intended to be used for drug trafficking. He ultimately pled guilty to multiple drug charges and was sentenced to a term of incarceration. The trial court granted the Commonwealth's motion for summary judgment and ordered the property forfeited to the Commonwealth. The appellate court held that the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure did not apply to forfeitures because the General Assembly provided the complete procedure to be followed that preempted the area. A forfeiture proceeding did not fall under Pa.R.C.P. No. 206.1(a)(1). Because a forfeiture proceeding was a quasi-criminal punitive proceeding, the General Assembly mandated a hearing requiring the Commonwealth to present its evidence in open court, much like it had to do in a criminal proceeding where similar constitutional principles were implicated and not do it just on the papers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed. The matter was remanded to the trial court to conduct a hearing as required by &sect; 6802(i) of the Forfeiture Act.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner was a Texas resident. The Board ultimately struck the penalties from the assessment, but upheld the PIT due. A majority opinion of the court had previously determined that the foreclosure of the property triggered the PIT obligation under 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7303(a)(3) and 61 Pa. Code &sect; 103.13. The court held that the majority's decision, upholding the applicability of the PIT to petitioner, a nonresident, who invested as a limited partner in a non-Pennsylvania limited partnership, based upon the foreclosure of a building owned by the limited partnership in Pennsylvania, was proper and fully and properly addresses the issues set forth in petitioner's  exceptions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The money at issue was seized from appellant after he was stopped by police officers for failing to stop his vehicle at a red light. On appeal, appellant argued that the trial court violated his rights by ordering forfeiture of his property after he was acquitted of the drug possession charges. The court disagreed and noted that it has already been determined that the fact that appellant was acquitted of the underlying criminal charges did not preclude the trial court from ordering forfeiture of the money. However, the court did find that the trial court erred by denying appellant the opportunity to be present at the forfeiture hearing. The court found that there was no record evidence that once appellant was incarcerated, the Commonwealth properly notified him of the forfeiture hearing, that he waived his right to attend, or that arrangements could not be made to insure his attendance at the hearing. Thus, appellant was not properly notified of his right to arrange his attendance at the forfeiture hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original jurisdiction matter, intervenors, two county commissioner associations, filed motions for a judgment on the pleadings in the suit brought by petitioners, individual jury commissions. Petitioners sought declaratory and injunctive relief relating to Act 108, which amended the County Code, 16 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 102(a),  401(f), and 1805(b) (Act 108). Petitioners filed a competing motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Act 108 abolished the office of jury commissioner in certain counties and made other changes to their duties and powers. The court determined that 108 did not violate any of the constitutional provisions upon which petitioners relied in seeking to obtain declaratory and injunctive relief. The court held that the unifying topic of county commissioners' powers was one that could be reasonable drawn and the two substantive provisions of Act 108 bore a logical connection to that topic, therefore, Act 108 did not violate Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. Further, the court held that Act 108 did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because there was no support in the law for the proposition that the elected office of jury commissioner was part of the judicial system because the courts have no constitutional authority to exercise control over that statutorily-created office. As a result, since there were no disputes regarding the facts, the court granted intervenor's motion for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first addressed the standing of the parties and held that petitioners had standing to bring the action because Act 13 imposed substantial, direct and immediate obligations on them that affect their government functions and Act 13 required that the municipalities enact zoning ordinances to comply with the provisions of Act 13. The court did find that 58 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3304 was unconstitutional, null and void as it violated Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1 by requiring municipalities to violate their comprehensive plans for growth and development and it violated substantive due process because it allowed incompatible uses in zoning districts and did not protect the interests of neighboring property owners from harm, altered the character of the neighborhood, and made irrational classifications. The court otherwise addressed the various arguments raised by the parties and upheld the remainder of Act 13 except for 58 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3215(b)(4), which was also declared null and void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, former insurance recipients, filed a class action against respondent lawmakers seeking declaratory, mandamus, and equitable relief with respect to the lawmakers' alleged violations of the Tobacco Settlement Act, 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5701.101-.5103, and the Pennsylvania Constitution. The lawmakers filed preliminary objections to the former recipients' second amended complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former recipients participated in a low-cost health insurance program, which was funded by the proceeds of a Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) between certain tobacco product manufacturers, the Commonwealth, and 46 other states. The lawmakers enacted legislation redirecting settlement monies received under the MSA from the tobacco settlement account and a related health endowment account to the Commonwealth's General Fund. As a result, the insurance program lacked necessary funding and ceased operations. The doctrine of sovereign immunity barred the mandamus relief sought because the lawmakers would have been required to take affirmative action, including the enactment of new legislation, in order to effectuate such relief. Furthermore, to the extent that the former recipients sought to restrain the lawmakers from enacting future legislation affecting the settlement monies, relief was barred by the Speech and Debate Clause of Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 15. Nonetheless, the former recipients stated sufficient claims challenging the constitutionality of the legislation under 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5701.1303 and the Pennsylvania Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Appellant had filed a petition under the Utility Service Tenants Rights Act, 68 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 399.3(a)(3), challenging the proposed water service termination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the method of service of the notice to connect issued by a municipal sewer authority, asserting that it was defective in that it was not served in person or by registered mail. However, the court found no defect in that the certified mailing he received satisfied the service requirement. Further, the court held that the notice was not defective because the municipal sewer authority, rather than the township made it, because the municipal sewer authority was acting as the township's agent for purposes of notifying appellant. The court further upheld the municipal sewer authority's power to charge for sewer services under the Municipality Authorities Act, 53 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5607(s). The court noted that an ordinance required appellant to connect to the sewer system, thus, there was not question that he would be required to pay the same sewer fees he disputed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant objectors challenged the order of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Lackawanna (Pennsylvania), which determined that appellee, a township zoning hearing board (ZHB), erred by denying appellee applicant's request for a certificate of nonconforming use and determining that a legal nonconforming use existed. The objectors also appealed the denial of their motion to quash.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant had purchased the property at issue in 2007 but failed to re-register the certificate of nonconforming use obtained by the prior owner within 60 days of purchasing the property, as required by a township ordinance. The ZHB denied the applicant's request for a certificate due to its failure to timely re-register the same under the ordinance. The court found that the trial court did not err in denying the objectors? motion to quash the applicant's appeal because the applicant's notice of appeal sufficiently placed the parties and the trial court on notice of the issue on appeal and its grounds. Further, the court determined that the trial court correctly found that the ZHB erred in concluding that the applicant was not entitled to continue the nonconforming use because it failed to timely re-register as the right to continue a nonconforming use arises from constitutional protections and not from regulatory provisions, thus, the right could not be lost in that way. Further, the plain language of the ordinance did not require such a result, as it did not disclose the consequences for a property owner's failure to timely re-register its nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the landowner that the board erred as a matter of law in concluding that the ordinance was not de jure exclusionary with respect to a prison use because a treatment center, as defined in the ordinance, was not sufficiently broad enough to encompass the use of a prison. The court found that it was uncontroverted that the ordinance failed to provide for a prison use within the township and that a prison was in no manner encompassed within the definition of treatment center.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer sought review of the order of the Board of Finance and Revenue which sustained the assessment of additional tax and interest under the Motor Carriers Road Tax Act (Act), 75 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9601-9622, following an audit of the taxpayer. Because the taxpayer purchased all fuel at retail, it contended that the Board erred in failing to provide it with any credit for taxes paid on the estimated fuel use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer hauled steel and other commodities throughout the United States by soliciting loads from various entities. It then hired owner operators, many of which were signed to permanent leases and issued International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) decals, to haul the loads. The taxpayer did not maintain bulk fuel facilities but purchased all fuel at retail locations. The auditor found many reporting errors and determined a figure for additional traveled but unreported miles. The auditor did not give the taxpayer credit for paying tax on the additional gallons of estimated fuel consumed or where fuel tickets produced by the taxpayer lacked required information such as the unit number or date of purchase. The court held that while the taxpayer's approach, that of using available information and audit techniques to arrive at an estimate of taxes paid on fuel consumed, had a logical appeal, it was completely contrary to the tax scheme established by the Act and IFTA. The court also rejected any suggestion that an unconstitutional taxation has occurred. There was no statutory or regulatory authority to support application of post-audit period data to calculate tax due.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In accordance with 53 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8602, appellee County passed an ordinance known as the &quot;Drink Tax.&quot; Appellant liquor-licensed restaurants brought an action challenging the Drink Tax. The Common Pleas Court of the County of Allegheny (Pennsylvania) held that the Drink Tax was valid. It, therefore granted the County's motion for summary judgment and denied the restaurants' cross-motion. The restaurants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 8602 authorized second class counties to obtain support for transit systems by imposing a tax on the sale at retail of liquor and malt and brewed beverages within the county. The restaurants argued that two separate enactments were required when taxing one industry and directing that money to a separate and distinct industry; otherwise, legislation ran afoul of the single subject rule of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. However, the use of the money raised by the &sect; 8602-enabled Drink Tax was unquestionably germane to the overarching subject of that enactment, transportation. Furthermore, the Drink Tax did not violate the uniformity clause of Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 or the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Because liquor licensed restaurants and state stores and distributors were taxed under different statutory regimes, the trial court correctly concluded that the County had a legitimate and rational basis for their different treatment with regard to the Drink Tax. Finally, the conflict-of-interest provisions of the County Administrative Code did not empower the trial court to void a vote by a member of County Council who may have been ineligible to vote.</SPAN></P>

A hearing was held before the city council.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pennsylvania State Ethics Commission had found that the former health officer had conducted business for other municipalities while being paid by the city and used the city's office equipment and supplies in doing so. The former health officer's primary contention on appeal was that the city council violated her procedural due process rights by failing to give her adequate notice of the hearing addressing her termination. The court found that a letter from the city council advising of the hearing gave less than three business days' notice. The court held that the time of the notice in the case was plainly inadequate, especially when considering the substantial property interest at stake and the relatively minor burdens of providing notice. As a result, the court held that the city council violated the former health officer's due process rights by failing to give her notice sufficiently in advance of the hearing. The court found no issue existed with regard to the city's director of public safety and health participating in the hearing since it was not an impermissible commingling of the prosecutorial and adjudicatory functions.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the ordinance was not facially overbroad but agreed with plaintiffs that it was impermissibly vague by offering no guidance as to what constituted a lawful and reasonable explanation for a person's presence in a high drug activity area or what a person must do to comply with a police dispersal order. As a result, the court found that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in the city's favor on that issue. Further, the court found that the city applied the ordinance in a manner that violated them minor's Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, rights and, thus, erred by granting the city summary judgment on that issue as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order to the extent that it granted summary judgment in favor of the city on the vagueness and Fourth Amendment claims and ordered that summary judgment be entered in favor of plaintiffs as to those claims only. The court otherwise affirmed the order in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the Executive Board of Pennsylvania and the Department of Labor and Industry, filed preliminary objections to a petition for review filed by petitioners, the Workers' Compensation Judges Professional Association and related others, alleging that rescission of a promised lump sum payment for salary purposes violated the Contracts and Taking Clauses of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The workers' compensation judges were classified as management level employees and accordingly, were not represented by a union and did not engage in collective bargaining. Due to budgetary concerns, the Board rescinded a one-step longevity increment, or lump sum payment, that had been approved for the judges. They filed suit, alleging that the rescission violated constitutional and statutory provisions and seeking both declaratory and injunctive relief. In resolving respondents' preliminary objections, the court found that as individuals sued in their official capacity were not &quot;persons&quot; for purposes of &sect; 1983, those claims could not stand. As the longevity increment was not bargained for and there was no consideration, there was no enforceable contract right. Further, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 did not prohibit the abrogation of the salary of a public officer during the term of his office. Additionally, the Board's resolutions did not constitute legislative actions. The claims under the Takings Clause of U.S. Const. amend. V and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 also failed, as the judges had no property right in increased salaries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 2870.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate allegedly attempted to register as a candidate and asserted that someone, presumably his local election board, refused to certify him as a candidate in that election because he refused to provide his personal residence information on his nomination petition and candidate's affidavit, as required by the Pennsylvania Election Code. He intended to run for elected office again and would again refuse to provide his home address. He argued that his privacy rights were greater than the Commonwealth's right to the information. The court agreed that the OOR and its Executive Director were not necessary or appropriate parties. There was no constitutional right to privacy in one's home address under the Pennsylvania Constitution. In addition, there was a compelling reason to require candidates for elected office to provide their home address on their nomination forms as every candidate had to be qualified for the position he sought. Just as members of the general public were required to provide their home address in order to register to vote, a candidate for public office had to provide such information.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held it was not error for the PLRB to rule that this was an unfair labor practice because implementing the award would not require a legislative enactment by county commissioners, as (1) transfers of available unencumbered funds were not legislative enactments within the meaning of 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1101.805 even though the county commissioners had to vote on such transfers, (2) while implementing the award would cost a significant sum, there were sufficient unreserved funds in the county's general fund to implement the award, and (3) the fact that maintaining these reserves was necessary for a good bond rating was insufficient to overcome the fact that sufficient funds were available to implement the award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants taxpayers sought judicial review in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania) of the decision of the Delaware County, Pa., Board of Assessment Appeals (Board) denying their appeal of an assessment of their real property. The trial court reduced the assessment, and the taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers said the assessment violated Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The appellate court disagreed because (1) they presented no county wide analysis, (2) their ratio studies of assessment to sales of similar neighborhood properties did not convince the trial court, which exclusively judged the credibility and weight of evidence, and (3) their evidence did not support a county wide reassessment or show willful discrimination, so they were only entitled to an assessment conforming to the tax district's common level ratio (CLR), which they received. A county wide reassessment was not required because the taxpayers (1) presented no county wide analysis, and (2) sought no such reassessment on appeal from the Board. An assessment was not void ab initio when the assessment notice did not show old and new assessment ratios, under former 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5349(b), because the taxpayers complained of a lack of the CLR, but the statute did not require such notice, so they could not contest the assessment nunc pro tunc. They were entitled to simple interest on a refund, based on the trial court's assessment reduction, from the date of overpayment, because 53 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8426(a) required it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner executor filed a class action petition for review of a decision of the Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue, alleging that respondent Commonwealth of Pennsylvania failed to rebate property taxes due under Pennsylvania's Senior Citizens Property Tax and Rebate Assistance Act, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6926.1301-6926.1313 (2006), and its predecessors. Petitioner filed a motion for class certification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's claim for a property tax rebate for 2009 was denied on the basis that the decedent died before January 1, 2010. He sought to certify a class comprising persons who filed valid claims for property taxes rebates for 2003 through 2008, who paid property taxes the subsequent calendar year, who were otherwise eligible to receive rebates for that year, but who died on or before December 31 of that year and did not receive a rebate. The court held that as petitioner brought the class action in the court's appellate, not equity, jurisdiction, and sought a rebate of a property tax (not a refund of taxes erroneously paid), he was not precluded from maintaining a class action seeking rebates, as long as the action otherwise met the requirements for class certification. As there were over 2000 class members, petitioner established numerosity. There were common questions of law and fact; petitioner's claims were typical of other class members' claims; the parties stipulated that petitioner's counsel could adequately represent the class; and there were no significant judicial administration concerns. The action thus met the requirements of Pa.R.C.P. No. 1702, 1708, 1709.</SPAN></P>

The WCJ denied and dismissed the employee's petition to review her benefit offset under &sect; 204(a) of the Workers' Compensation Act, 77 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 71(a), based on her receipt of old age Social Security (SS) benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sustained an injury in the course of her employment and she began receiving workers' compensation benefits. Due to the employee's receipt of SS old age benefits, the employer filed a notice of workers' compensation benefit offset and began taking a 50 percent of those benefits. The employee sought review, alleging that a portion of the SS benefits were attributable to her late husband's earnings or annual cost of living increases. The WCJ denied the employee's petition, finding that the employer established its entitlement to the offset. The Board affirmed that determination. On further review, the court conducted an equal protection analysis under the rational relation test. It determined that there was no violation of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 by the &quot;old age&quot; offset provision under &sect; 71(a), as it was rationally related to the purpose of the workers' compensation law. Further, the employer met its burden of showing the source of SS benefits against which it took an offset. Accordingly, the offset was not based on any of the late husband's earning SS benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the Department of Corrections and the Pennsylvania General Assembly (GA), filed preliminary objections under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1028(a)(4) to a petition for review of petitioner inmate, seeking declaratory judgment relief based on the allegation that &sect; 6602(f)(1) of the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6602(f)(1), was unconstitutional due to a conflict with the Remedies Clause of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed his petition for review on behalf of all Pennsylvania inmates. He sought a declaration that &sect; 6602(f)(1) was unconstitutional based on an alleged conflict with the Remedies Clause, as he had been identified as an &quot;abusive litigator&quot; and his cases had accordingly been dismissed. Respondents' request for dismissal of the petition for review under &sect; 6602 was denied, as it was determined that it did not constitute &quot;prison conditions litigation.&quot; Respondents thereafter filed preliminary objections. The court reflected on prior judicial precedents and noted that the abusive litigator provisions of the PLRA had not been found to violate U.S. Const. amend. V, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and the equal protection clauses of both constitutions. Accordingly, it found that the complaint failed to state a cause of action because there was a legitimate governmental interest in deterring frivolous lawsuits. A preliminary objection based on legislative immunity was not deemed waived although it should have been raised under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1030. Further, such claims against the GA were within the scope of legislative immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause, Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 15.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission found that the credible evidence established that petitioner possessed a handgun in his office, left a handgun in his vehicle while parked on property owned or leased by the Department, and showed the handgun to his subordinate while in his vehicle. The Commission determined that petitioner's conduct violated the Department's prohibition on the possession of weapons in the workplace. The court found that the Commission's decision was based on the credible evidence of petitioner's co-workers, thus, it was supported by the evidence. The court held that petitioner's right to bear arms was not violated since that right was not unlimited and may be restricted for the good of the order of society and the protection of citizens, such as prohibiting firearms in government buildings. The court further rejected petitioner's discrimination claims because he failed in his burden of proof since the Department offered a non-discriminatory explanation for the personnel action, the violation of the weapons policy, and that decision was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The casino applied for a Category 2 License. The Board issued a Suitability Report which deemed the casino financially suitable and awarded a License subject to certain conditions. After receiving extensions, the Board denied the casino's motion for extension and imposed a $2,000 per diem sanction continuing until the casino complied with the conditions of the Board's order. The Board tabled a ruling on BIE's motion for summary judgment and gave the casino until a certain date to provide definitive documentation of a transaction with the casino's, and report at the Board's meeting. The Board granted summary judgment in favor of BIE, and revoked the casino's license. The court, applying 4 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1202 among other statutes, held the Board did not commit reversible error by applying the same financial suitability test used to determine the casino's eligibility as a slot machine license applicant to determine that it violated the conditions as a licensee. The casino's due process rights were not violated as lesser sanctions had been imposed without success. Revocation was not an excessive sanction under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The court found no merit to the developer's contention that its property was surrounded by commercially zoned properties. The court further found that the developer was not denied a fair and unbiased tribunal to review its request for a zoning change because it did not actually argue that any of the supervisors were biased, it elected to proceed before the supervisors, it did not seek recusal of any of the supervisors, and it did not seek to present additional evidence before the trial court regarding its claim that the supervisors deprived it of its right to a fair proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Commonwealth of Pennsylvania brought an action on behalf of state agencies against defendant drug company. Plaintiff's claims under the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (CPL), 73 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 201-1-201-9.3, were tried to the court, which ruled in favor of the Commonwealth. A jury returned a verdict in favor of defendant on the Commonwealth's common law claims. Both parties filed post-verdict motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that there was ample support for the finding that defendant violated 73 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 201-2(4)(xxi) by contributing to the reporting of inflated average wholesale prices for its drugs. Thus, it was bound to issue a permanent injunction under 73 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 201-4. The court held that an injunction could issue to restrain future conduct based on prior unlawful activity; that cessation of the offending conduct did not in and of itself bar a claim for injunctive relief; and that the court could consider whether the offending conduct was likely to reoccur absent the grant of an injunction. Nothing in &sect; 201-4 prevented the Attorney General from suing on behalf of the agencies. Furthermore, the plain language of 73 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 201-4.1 did not preclude an award of restoration to the agencies. Defendant was not entitled to a stay of the injunction. Many of its arguments would become moot once the injunction was modified, and for it to continue to engage in unlawful conduct would harm the public. The Commonwealth was not entitled to costs or fees, as &sect;&sect; 201-4 and 201-4.1 did not provide for such awards in an enforcement action by the Attorney General.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the Commonwealth's post-trial motions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sued defendant pharmaceutical companies, alleging they caused two Commonwealth agencies to pay inflated prices for drugs. The Pennsylvania trial court found defendants violated Pennsylvania's Consumer Protection Law (CPL), 73 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 201-1 to 201-9.3. Plaintiff sought a new trial on its dismissed tort claims; defendants moved to vacate the awards of injunctive relief and restoration under the CPL.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged defendants reported inflated average wholesale prices (AWPs) for certain drugs, thus damaging the agencies, which relied on these reported prices in reimbursing pharmacies for drugs provided to Medicaid recipients and certain elderly patients. The instant court held that 1) because the AWPs were inflated and fictitious, were not the prices intended by Pennsylvania's reimbursement laws, and had tendency to deceive those who dealt with the reimbursement system, defendants committed unfair or deceptive practices under 73 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 201-2(4)(xxi); 2) the practices were properly restrained under 73 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 201-4; and 3) restoration was properly ordered under 73 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 201-4.1. The trial court properly dismissed plaintiff's negligent misrepresentation claim on grounds the agencies did not rely on the accuracy of reported AWPs. It properly denied plaintiff's civil conspiracy claims since it did not find malice. Section 201-4.1 did not authorize an award of costs to plaintiff, and &sect;&sect; 201-4, 201-4.1, which governed enforcement actions by the Pennsylvania Attorney General, did not authorize an award of attorney fees to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' postjudgment motions were denied, as were plaintiff's motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, alternately, for a new trial on the negligent misrepresentation and civil conspiracy claims, as well as its request to modify the award to include costs and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner bank filed exceptions to the court's opinion and order affirming the denial of its petition for a refund by respondent, the Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue, of a portion of the Shares Tax it paid for the 2002 tax year. The tax commonly referred to as the Shares Tax is set forth in Article VII of the Tax Reform Code, 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 7701 - 7706.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank raised a constitutional challenge to use of the combination provision under 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7701.1(c)(2) to calculate its Shares Tax, contending that because the provision applied only to institutions that had merged with another institution subject to the Shares Tax but not to institutions that had merged with out-of-state entities not subject to the tax, application of the combination provision violated both the Uniformity Clause, Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, and equal protection. The court concluded that a lack of uniformity was established as the lost value during the first few post merger years, and the tax which should have been paid on those values, is never recovered. However, the court did not agree with the bank's contention that the court sever the combination provision for all institutions. Instead, the court ordered that the averaging methodology required by 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7701.1(a) could be severed or limited when the taxable amount of shares results from the merger of an institution with a non-institution or an institution that has been in existence for fewer than six years without rendering the remainder of the Shares Tax incapable of execution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the bank's exceptions, ordered the prospective application of limited severance to the statutory provision identified, and ordered the Commonwealth to take necessary steps to provide meaningful retrospective relief in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The matter was on remand from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which reversed a dismissal of the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was previously convicted of aggravated assault and he was sentenced to a term of six years' imprisonment under the former Youthful Offenders Act (YOA), former 61 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 481-486 (repealed). Thereafter, the sentence was revised to a flat five-year sentence. However, the DOC calculated the dates of that sentence as a five-to-10-year sentence pursuant to the requirements of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9756(b). After serving the five-year term, the inmate was released on parole. Thereafter, he was convicted of two offenses and he was recommitted as a convicted parole violator. Accordingly, he was required to serve the backtime on his earlier conviction prior to beginning the new sentence of 15-to-30 years. The inmate sought mandamus relief, which was dismissed. On reversal and remand, the court found that the flat sentence was illegal because it contained a minimum sentence, in violation of the YOA. Further, the inmate had served the maximum sentence on the prior conviction, such that he was not on parole. The recommitment was accordingly error, and the court found that a change to the starting date was required to remedy the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the inmate's motion for judgment on the pleadings, and denied the DOC's request for summary relief.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 998, and 77 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1000.5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners asserted that the fee limitation provisions were unconstitutional under Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 10(c), the separation of powers doctrine, and violated due process. The court noted that 77 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 998 of the Act places a ceiling on the percentage of contingency fees attorneys may claim when successfully representing a claimant, and 77 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1000.5 of the Act provides workers' compensation judges with the authority to approve and void compromise and release settlement agreements. The court held that neither provision was unconstitutional or violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court found that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's explanatory comment that accompanied Pa. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5 specifically provided that the law may impose limitations on contingent fees. The court found that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has made clear that laws that the Pennsylvania General Assembly adopts may set ceilings on the percentage of a workers' compensation settlement or award that an attorney may obtain in performing legal services for a claimant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner had obtained various federal and state permits to develop its property and operate a commercial cargo airport. An airport was permitted by a special exception under a county zoning ordinance. The township ordinance that was enacted would prevent the landowner from operating its airport by a special exception. A newly appointed planning commission unanimously recommended adoption of the proposed township zoning ordinance and map. The landowner challenged the validity of the ordinance establishing the planning commission and the township zoning ordinance and map as void ab initio because it was not enacted in compliance the public notice requirement of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11002-A. The court found that the township's failure to strictly comply with the seven day time limitation for notice did not support an exemption of the landowner's appeal from the 30-day appeal period under &sect; 11002-A and the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5571.1, and it failed to show any prejudice as a result of the township failing to strictly comply with the seven day time limitation in the MPC, 53 Pa.

Defendants filed preliminary objections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's requests for court records were denied. The appellate court held he could not use a declaratory judgment suit to attack his criminal proceedings because, under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9542, the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9541 - 9546, was his only remedy. He had no common law right to the records because the Right-To-Know Law (RTKL), 65 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 67.101 - 67.3104 and Pa.R.J.A. 509 controlled. The appellate court could not take jurisdiction because he did not exhaust his administrative remedies under 65 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 67.1101(a) or Pa.R.J.A. 509(c). His request to declare a judge was not another judge's designee for purposes of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5704(2)(iv) failed because this attacked his criminal convictions, which were only reviewable under the PCRA. His claim to recuse an entire trial court bench failed because (1) the appellate court lacked jurisdiction, under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 761(b), and (2) his PCRA petition was the proper forum to address it. His claims to remove a judge as a trial court's RTKL appeals officer and to regulate who signed the trial court's orders failed because only the Pennsylvania Supreme Court could decide such claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner coalition appealed the order of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Bucks (Pennsylvania), which denied its petition to have their entire borough placed into the same school district. The trial court denied the petition because respondent, the Pennsylvania Secretary of Education, found that the coalition's proposal lacked merit from an educational standpoint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borough represented by the coalition was split between two school districts. They sought to have the entire borough placed into one, which was contiguous to the entire borough as opposed to the other district it was split into, which was not contiguous with any part of the borough. The Secretary had reasoned that in the interest of racial diversity, the eastern half of the borough should remain part of another district. The court found that the Secretary misapprehended and misapplied the applicable statutory law. The court noted that the Secretary's authority to pass on the merits of a petition was not open-ended but restricted under the Public School Code, 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2-242.1(a), to the substantive provisions of the Public School Code. The court found that the coalition's petition, on its face, had educational merit because it would end the discontiguous boundaries of one district, which offended both the Public School Code, 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2-201 and 2-242.1. Also, the affected children would be placed in a school district that produced better academic results and eliminated a long commute, if the coalition's evidence was credited on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to remand to the Secretary for further proceedings in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Pennsylvania State Registration Board for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, and Geologists, ordered petitioner licensee to pay a civil penalty for doing the work of a professional geologist after his Pennsylvania license had lapsed. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pennsylvania Department of State, Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs, charged petitioner with violating, inter alia, &sect; 4(e) (63 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 151(e)) of the Pennsylvania Engineer, Land Surveyor and Geologist Registration Law. Petitioner argued that the Board erred in imposing a civil penalty for this violation because his professional work was environmental, not geological and he did not hold himself out to the public as a licensed Pennsylvania geologist. The court held that the Bureau erred by charging petitioner with a &quot;violation&quot; of the &sect; 4(e), the statutory definition of the &quot;practice of geology&quot;; it should have charged him with a violation of &sect; 3(a) (63 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 150(a)) of the Law, which made it unlawful to practice geology without a license. Section 4(e) authorized the Board to enforce &sect; 3(a), but &sect; 4(e) was not a provision that was capable of being &quot;violated&quot; by a registered professional. To impose the penalties set forth in its regulation, 49 Pa. Code &sect; 43b.13a, the Board had to charge petitioner with a violation of &sect; 3(a). It did not do so. Without such a finding, the Board lacked any basis to invoke its civil penalty regulation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment to the district because in case law, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had held that it was reasonable to classify income as earned and unearned for local income tax purposes as well as had determined that taxing employee contributions to a deferred compensation plan did not violate principles of tax uniformity. The court upheld the trial court's determination and rejected the extreme hypothetical cases presented by the taxpayer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a county board of assessment appeals (BAA) and a school district (SD), sought review of an order from the Common Pleas Court of the County of Carbon (Pennsylvania), which sustained a real estate tax assessment appeal of appellee condominium unit owner (CUO). The matter arose from the SD's challenge, and the BAA's resulting increase in assessment, to the unit's assessment for the 2008 tax year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after the CUO's purchase, the SD filed an assessment appeal. The BAA sustained the appeal and increased the CUO's assessment based on application of the county's common level ratio to the current market value. On appeal to the trial court, the CUO presented his own testimony and that of a licensed real estate appraiser. The trial court sustained the appeal, concluding that pursuant to &sect;&sect; 702 and 704 of the Assessment Law, 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5453.702 and 5453.704, there were excessive assessments for properties conveyed after a particular date. The trial court found a violation of uniformity under Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, and it reduced the assessment to that from the base year. On appeal, the appraiser's testimony regarding assessment ratios was deemed competent, and the CUO met his burden of proof. The evidence was thus sufficient to allow the trial court to determine the ratio of assessed value to market value of the comparable properties. However, the trial court erred in returning the assessment to the base year. Rather, the remedy for the lack of uniformity was a reduction in the assessment to conform to the common level prevailing in the tax district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A property owner appealed from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County (Pennsylvania) which entered an in rem judgment in the amount of $ 9,074.47 in favor of the Borough of Walnutport and against the property owner, stating that such judgment may be enforced pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 3190, against certain property. Included in the judgment was attorney fees and judgment interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner and his wife divorced. The wife conveyed her interest in the property to the property owner. However, the property owner never recorded the deed. A letter was sent to the property owner indicating that the property's street was scheduled for reconstruction and that curbing had to be installed. A signed certified receipt was returned to the Borough. The property owner did not install curbing. The Borough hired a contractor to install the curbing. The appellate court held the Borough met its burden of proof that it was entitled to collect attorney fees from the property owner. As the property owner lost his challenge, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7187 mandated an award of reasonable attorney fees. The attorney fees of $ 1,183.62 as found by the trial court were reasonable and therefore, the Borough was entitled to such fees. The Borough's service was proper pursuant to 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7141. The property owner was the sole occupant of the premises. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the property owner had failed to prove that the property sustained damage as a result of the Borough's work in installing curbing abutting the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was affirmed as to attorney fees, notice, property damage and the counterclaim. The trial court was reversed regarding the charging of interest.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the legislature could not treat similarly situated taxpayers differently. S-corporations and C-corporations were not similarly situated taxpayers, however, by virtue of the S election and the financial benefits for which S election was made. Furthermore, a business entity could only become an S-corporation through election of its owners. The shareholders could not have the benefits of the S election without the burdens.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner contended the ordinances were void ab initio because they were improperly enacted by the township.

While the 1990 ordinance was not recorded in as required by the law then in effect, it was maintained as a public record by the township and became part of its code book by virtue of a later codification. The trial court found the procedural defects did not violate due process, as the township provided sufficient notice of the proposed ordinances to insure an opportunity to be heard. It found that invalidating such longstanding ordinances would cause greater harm than was implicated by their enforcement. The appellate court agreed, and held that the later codification cured any defect in the prior recording of the 1990 ordinance. As owner participated in the meetings and there was no showing of prejudice, the defects did not implicate due process or other constitutional rights to the extent necessary to trigger the void ab initio doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, appellants, a city, two allied intervenors, and a police union, challenged the order of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Lackawanna (Pennsylvania), which denied the city's petition to vacate an interest arbitration award from 2009 involving the city and the union. The award was issued pursuant to Act 111, the Policemen and Firemen Collective Bargaining Act, 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 217.1-217.10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union represented police personnel. At issue was the effect of the Municipalities Financial Recovery Act (Act 47), 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 11701.101-11701.501, on collective bargaining rights under Act 111. Instead of vacating the award, the trial court modified the wage, health insurance benefits, and pension provisions of the award. Of significance, the city was determined to be a financially distressed municipality under Act 47 and was operating under a Recovery Plan. On appeal, the city contended that the 2009 award violated case law, controlling statutes and the Recovery Plan. The union contended that the trial court erred in vacating mid-year wage increases and in applying Act 47. The court agreed that a 2008 wage increase violated the prohibition against back wages or other retroactive adjustments in the Recovery Plan as did a wage increase for the year 2009. The court also found that the trial court erred in deleting the mid-year wage increases for the years 2009 through 2014. Ultimately, the court rejected the city's request to vacate the entire award and made various modification to bring it in compliance with the Recovery Plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city, its allied intervenors, and a firefighters union, sought review of an order of the Lackawanna County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania), which denied the city's petition to vacate an interest arbitration award. The trial court modified the wage, health insurance benefits, and pensions provisions of the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city was a &quot;financially distressed municipality&quot; under the Municipalities Financial Recovery Act, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 11701.101-11701.501, and a recovery plan was developed that included requirements for the city's employees. Thereafter, when the city and the firefighters reached an impasse in negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), the matter was submitted to arbitration. An interest award was modified in order to comply with the plan. After another impasse for the next CBA, another interest arbitration award was made. The trial court modified the award in order to comply with the terms of the plan. Such modifications included wage, health insurance benefits, and pensions provisions. On appeal, the court made further modifications. It noted that prospective wage increases did not violate the plan. The health insurance increases in the award did not exceed the cap in the plan. Provisions of the staffing requirements that unduly interfered with the city's managerial prerogatives were voided, and cost containment measures were included. Modifications to the pension plan violated 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30495(b) by allowing a pension in excess of the highest limit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court order by reinstating the mid-year wages increases for the years 2009 through 2014, modifying the date for deletion of health care benefits for retirees, and voiding certain staffing requirements. It also included the mandatory cost containment provisions, and vacated the pension plan provisions. As modified, the court affirmed the trial court order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the BAA's procedures were not unconstitutional because only the hearing examiner had the authority to compel the ticket writer's presence at the hearing under Philadelphia, Pa., Code &sect; 12-2807(2). It was disingenuous for the driver to claim that he was denied the opportunity to cross-examine the ticket writer as he never requested the ticket writer's presence, and failed to raise any issue that would have required the ticket writer's presence. The driver did not challenge the date and time, location, or reason for the citation, or any other information provided by the ticket writer. The ticket writer's absence from the hearing did not violate due process. The driver did not have a right of confrontation. The absence of the original ticket from the record, assuming it was required under &sect; 12-2807(2), was harmless error. The driver did not refute that he received the ticket, and presented photographs showing his vehicle parked in a stopping prohibited zone on the date and time in question. The driver admitted that his vehicle was partially parked in a stopping prohibited zone. The hearing examiner's decision was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Labor &amp; Industry (L&amp;I), filed preliminary objections to the amended petition for review filed by petitioners, a building association, several developers, and builders. Also before the court was the application for summary relief filed by petitioners. Petitioners sought a declaration that the 2009 Pennsylvania's Uniform Construction Code (UCC) and related codes were null and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners asserted in their petition for review that the 2009 UCC and other related codes were null and void as violative of Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 and sought to enjoin the L&amp;I from enforcing the codes, plus other relief. Petitioners claimed that the new and amended provisions of the 2009 codes, especially the sprinkler requirements, had the effect of increasing the cost of an average newly-constructed home by approximately $ 15,000 and averred that the additional costs will have a significant impact on the demand for their home building and remodeling services. The court held that the post-UCC Review and Advisory Council Pennsylvania Construction Code Act (PCCA), 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 7210.101-7210.1103, neither improperly delegated the Pennsylvania General Assembly's rule-making authority, nor its authority over the execution and administration of that law. So, the L&amp;I's adoption of the International Code Council's 2009 codes as Pennsylvania's 2009 UCC did not violate Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. Thus, petitioners failed to overcome their burden of demonstrating that the PCCA clearly, palpably, and plainly violated the Pennsylvania Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the L&amp;I's preliminary objections. The court further determined that by sustaining the L&amp;I's preliminary objections, petitioners' amended petition for review was dismissed and was no longer before the court. Therefore, petitioners' application for summary relief was dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department received a cardiologist's &quot;Initial Reporting Form,&quot; DL 13, indicating that licensee suffered from intermittent complete heart block and that the condition affected his ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The Department notified licensee that it was recalling his driver's license indefinitely. The Department enclosed a &quot;Cardiovascular Form,&quot; DL-120, with the recall notice, which was completed by licensee's treating physician, who indicated that licensee had a heart block for which a pacemaker had been implanted, and that licensee was physically competent to operate a motor vehicle. The Department informed licensee that he did not meet its medical standards and that the Department would not restore his operating privilege. The appellate court held that, contrary to the Department's contentions, the trial court correctly held that prior case law established that 67 Pa. Code &sect; 83.49(a) created an impermissible irrebuttable presumption. In addition, the doctor's reports constituted substantial evidence in support of the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employer sought review of an order from respondent, the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (Pennsylvania), which affirmed an unemployment compensation referee's decision. The referee had determined that a claimant was not disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation benefits (UCBs) under &sect; 402(h) of the Unemployment Compensation Law (UCL), 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 802(h).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was a cosmetologist for a hair salon. She applied for UCBs after her hours were reduced. While working part-time, she also provided services for the employer. The claimant reported earnings from both workplaces. It was initially determined that the claimant was not disqualified from receiving UCBs. On review, the referee agreed, finding that an employer/employee relationship existed between the claimant and the employer. The Board also agreed, finding that the claimant was not an independent contractor (IC) for the employer. The Board did not apply the IC factors in holding that there was no disqualification under &sect;&sect; 402(h) and 4(l)(2)(B) of the UCL, 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 802(h) and  753(l)(2)(B). On further review, the court held that the Board erred in interpreting the Cosmetology Law, 63 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 507-527, and regulations to determine whether the claimant was an employee or an IC instead of applying the factors typically considered under the IC test. The Board could consider 63 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 514 as well as 49 Pa. Code &sect;&sect; 7.81, 7.82, and 7.83 in assessing whether the employer had the right to review the claimant's work or monitor her performance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order of the Board, and remanded the matter for a new adjudication by the Board that addressed the IC test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Court of Common Pleas, through the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts (AOPC), sought a declaratory judgment that respondent Office of Open Records (OOR) did not have the jurisdiction to force the County to provide e-mails and correspondence from the Director of the County Office of Domestic Relations to certain requestors pursuant to the Right-to-Know Law (RTKL), 65 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 67.101-67.3104. AOPC sought an injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The requestors sought inappropriate e-mails from or to any e-mail accounts used by a County employee, who was also a court employee, related to his suspension. The County denied the request. The OOR granted the requestors' appeal and ordered the County to release the records. The court held the fact that the employee was paid by the County did not affect his status as a judicial employee. Likewise, the fact that the County had access to the employee's e-mails because it provided the County's court computer system was irrelevant. Just because the County provided logistic support to the courts did not mean that every record stored on what the County provided as part of its function to support the court made it a County record. Otherwise, every record ever generated by a County court, including the draft opinions and law clerk memorandums, would be accessible through the RTKL simply by submitting the request to the County instead, an absurd result that would make 65 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 67.304. of the RTKL meaningless. Besides violating the RTKL, AOPC was correct that the OOR's order constituted a blatant and unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">AOPC's motion for summary relief was granted, and the OOR and County were permanently enjoined from releasing any information, documents or materials that in any way pertain to the employee or other judicial employees that were responsive to the requestors' requests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of an order from the Common Pleas Court of the County of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), which affirmed a decision of appellee, a city zoning board of adjustment (ZBA). The ZBA had denied the owner's second application for a variance in order to install a wall wrap advertising sign due to a lack of proof, res judicata from a prior decision, and a finding of constitutionality as to the zoning code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's property was a commercial building that housed numerous tenants. It sought to install a large wall wrap advertising sign on the building. It previously erected a non-accessory wall wrap sign on the building without first acquiring a zoning and use permit. When the owner thereafter applied for such permit one year later, the request was rejected by the city. The owner's application for a variance was approved by the ZBA, but reversed on appeal due to a failure to prove an unnecessary hardship. The owner again applied for a zoning/use registration permit for a wall wrap sign, which was denied by the ZBA. It held that the evidence did not support granting the variance, the prior decision was res judicata, and that the owner's constitutional challenge to the zoning code lacked merit. The trial court affirmed that decision. On further review, the court initially noted that civic groups which appeared before the ZBA and complied with Philadelphia, Pa., Zoning Code &sect; 14-1807(2) had the right to intervene as of right in the appeal. The court found that res judicata applied to issues raised and that could have been raised, as there was no substantial change in circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relying on 63 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 151.2(b)(1)(i) of the Pennsylvania Engineer, Land, Surveyor and Geologist Registration Law and 49 Pa. Code &sect; 37.1, respondent, the Pennsylvania Registration Board for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors and Geologists, denied petitioner applicant's appeal of the provisional denial of his application to sit for the fundamentals of engineering examination. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a university awarded petitioner a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering, he applied to sit for the engineering exam. The Board voted provisionally to deny his application because the Accreditation Board in Engineering and Technology (ABET) had not accredited the university's electrical engineering program. He appealed; at the hearing, a university professor opined that due to an increase in the number of faculty members currently devoted to the program, it would satisfy the ABET criteria, but the university had not re-applied for ABET accreditation due to the cost involved. The Board deferred to ABET and denied the appeal. The court held that while a person of ordinary intelligence could reasonably believe that a four-year degree from an accredited university satisfied the Board's standard set forth in 49 Pa. Code &sect; 37.1, the regulation was not void on its face. But because the Board did not exercise its independent statutory authority to evaluate the university's electrical engineering program, but specifically declined to do so, relying exclusively on the lack of ABET accreditation, 49 Pa. Code &sect; 37.1 was unconstitutionally applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the Board and remanded the matter to the Board with directions to permit petitioner, upon application, to sit for the fundamentals of engineering examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challengers sought review of the order of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Carbon (Pennsylvania), which upheld a zoning ordinance enacted 12 years earlier.

Ann. &sect; 11002-A(b), and the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5571.1(a). Intervenor objectors were also parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challengers owned land in the township, which they used as a quarry. The zoning ordinance at issue was enacted in 1996 and established a comprehensive zoning scheme that restricted the use and development of the land in the township. In upholding the validity of the zoning ordinance at issue, the trial court rejected the challengers' attempt to hold the ordinance void ab initio. The court emphasized that the challengers declined the offer of a hearing on their procedural validity challenge. As a result, the challengers did not prove the existence of a procedural defect affecting notice or due process concerns. The court held that the challengers did not rebut a statutory presumption that the township and its landowners substantially relied on the validity and effectiveness of the zoning ordinance over the 12 years between enactment of the zoning ordinance and the procedural validity challenge. Therefore, the court declined to declare the ordinance void ab initio. Since the challengers refused to have a hearing, the court was unable to determine if the change to the ordinance on the night it was enacted was substantial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner logging company, a sole proprietorship, sought review of an adjudication and order of respondent Insurance Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania who affirmed a determination by respondent Appeals Subcommittee of the Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau (PCRB) which denied the company's challenge to its business's classification for purposes of calculating its workers' compensation insurance premium.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company purchased and harvested timber, and hauled and marketed logs. It had its own log truck, which it principally used to haul its logs from its staging areas to saw mills and pulp mills. Historically, either the owner or a logging employee drove the log truck. The company had only one employee, a part-time truck driver, who did not perform any other logging or logging-related activities. The company asked that its classification be changed to Code 811. The PCRB took the position that the company had been properly classified in Code 009. The Commissioner rejected the company's appeal and found that any hardship or perceived unfairness was self-inflicted to some extent as the company switched its workers' compensation carrier and hired an employee rather than outsource the job to an independent hauler. The court found that the record supported the Commissioner's reasoning. While advocating for its preferred classification system over the PCRB classification system, the company failed to explain how the PCRB system actually violated the Workers' Compensation Act or the Insurance Company Law of 1921 and was thus ultra vires. Nor did it show any constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was a convicted sex offender. The Board issued a decision to parole the prisoner to a Community Corrections Center upon his completion of a sex offender program. The prisoner was placed on a waiting list. Following the adoption of new procedures, the Board modified its decision and stated that the prisoner would be released on parole upon completion of a sex offender program. The Board rejected all of the prisoner's home plan proposals because the residences were too close to schools. The Board argued that 61 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 315 was inconsistent with the Parole Act and &sect; 35 of the Parole Act repealed all parts of acts that were inconsistent with the Parole Act. The court agreed with the Board. To the extent the prisoner would construe 61 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 315 to require the Board to release him on parole simply because he served his minimum sentence, 61 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 315 was inconsistent with the Parole Act. Because the Board had no duty to issue a release order for the prisoner pursuant to 61 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 315, the Board was entitled to summary relief. The Board's modification of its decision did not violate the ex post facto rights of the prisoner.</SPAN></P>

Their claim was that the Commonwealth was required to transfer such funds. Although preliminary objections filed by the Commonwealth had been previously overruled for the most part, the question presented on the merits was not ruled upon. In ruling on the summary relief motion, the court initially noted that there were no genuine issues of material fact. It held that the Commonwealth had a duty under 40 Pa. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant union challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), which granted appellee city's petition to set aside an Act 111, 43 Pa.

The union had filed a grievance alleging the city violated a parity provision in a 2002-06 collective bargaining agreement (CBA) by failing to pay them the 3 percent wage increase given to the police in 2007, plus $ 500.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union consisted of firefighters.

The arbitration award sustained the union's grievance and directed the city to pay the union members the three percent wage increase plus an additional $ 500 wage increase. In attempting to set aside the arbitration award, the city argued that the arbitrator exceeded his power since the CBA expired at the end of 2006 and the economic provisions in expired contracts did not carry over in the absence of a new agreement. The trial court agreed, finding that economic terms, including wage increase provisions, of expired contracts did not carry over in the absence of a new agreement. The court held that Act 47 and the 2006 Recovery Plan could be applied to a wage increase awarded for a year after the term of an expired CBA. However, to the extent the arbitrator directed the city to violate the 2006 Recovery Plan and thereby also violate Act 47, he required the city to perform an illegal act, which was in excess of his powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the order of the trial court by holding that the city could voluntarily grant a 3 percent wage increase, but it could not voluntarily grant a wage increase greater than 3 percent, thus, the award granting an additional wage increase of $ 500 was set aside, and only wage increases in conformance with the 2006 Recovery Plan were permitted. As modified, the court otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A neighboring landowner appealed the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania) erred in approving a settlement agreement between the developers and the Board of Supervisors. The neighboring landowner argued the settlement agreement constituted unlawful contract zoning and/or spot zoning. In addition, the neighboring landowner asserted the settlement agreement infringed on its procedural due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The settlement agreement allowed for development of a developer's 51-acre property which was the subject of a land use appeal and a mandamus action. The settlement agreement also permitted mixed-use development on adjoining properties owned by the other developers. The total acreage affected by the settlement agreement was 219 acres. The appellate court concluded the trial court lacked authority to approve development of that portion of the subject properties beyond the 51-acre tract at issue in the underlying litigation. Therefore, the trial court's authority was limited to review of the supervisors' handling of the conditional use application, which was brought up on appeal. By approving the settlement agreement, which allowed for development of other properties owned by other entities who were not involved in the appealed conditional use decision, the trial court exceeded its statutory scope of review. The spot zoning claim was rejected as it related to the 51-acre portion of the properties. The settlement agreement did not result in a violation of its procedural due process rights as it related to the 51-acre portion of the subject properties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order was reversed to the extent it approved development of that portion of the subject properties beyond the 51-acre tract at issue in the underlying litigation. The matter was remanded to the trial court for consideration of whether to approve that portion of the settlement agreement that related only to development of the 51-acre tract at issue or to reject the settlement agreement in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a debt service provider, filed a summary relief application against respondents, the Department of Banking (DOB) (Pennsylvania) and the Secretary thereof, seeking a judgment declaring that all sections of the Debt Management Services Act, 63 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2401-2449, were unconstitutional as applied to debt settlement service providers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act granted the DOB broad powers to regulate debt settlement and debt management service providers. It was noted that respondents' prior request to dismiss the petition for failure to state a claim had been denied. At that time, the court stated that the Act granted a standardless delegation of authority to the DOB with respect to the regulation and setting of fees for providers. Although the DOB had not yet promulgated regulations, the matter was ripe for judicial review because the provider made a facial challenge to the Act itself. Respondents failed to support their claim that factual issues were in dispute that prevented adjudication. Moreover, the question of statutory interpretation was one of law. The court found that previously, it was determined that the Act set forth sufficient standards to support the authority of the DOB to require licensure of providers. However, 63 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2403(b) was unconstitutional, as the DOB lacked authority to promulgate regulations affecting providers. Similarly, the lack of standards in 63 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2415(h) rendered it unconstitutional. However, there were adequate policy choices as to licensing of providers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the provider's application in part, declaring two specific sections of the Act unconstitutional and unenforceable. The remainder of the application was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Commonwealth filed a petition for forfeiture against appellant real property owner, who had been acquitted of drug-related criminal charges. The Common Pleas Court of the County of Northampton (Pennsylvania) granted the Commonwealth's petition. Appellant challenged the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant first argued that the Controlled Substances Forfeiture Act, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 6801-6802, directed that the Rules of Civil Procedure applied in forfeiture proceedings and that the Commonwealth was required to comply with the service provisions in the rules. The court stated that the provisions in 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6802 provided a framework that ensured sufficient notice to an owner. Next, it was not necessary that a forfeiture be supported by an underlying criminal conviction. With regard to whether the forfeiture of appellant's house violated the Excessive Fines Clause of U.S. Const. amend. VIII, the value of appellant's house, $65,000, was not grossly disproportionate to the maximum penalty for the conspiracy, $100,000. Furthermore, there was no error in the trial court's conclusion that appellant's violation was part of a pattern of misbehavior. As for the harm resulting from appellant's conduct, the record supported the trial court's findings that the harm caused to society by drug trafficking was self-evident, that appellant's property exacted a heavy toll from government resources; and the harm resulting from appellant's property was widespread.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant objectors challenged the order of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Lycoming (Pennsylvania), which denied their substantive validity challenges to certain zoning ordinance amendments made by appellee, a county zoning hearing board (ZHB), and that upheld the ZHB's grant of a zoning permit request by appellee developer to construct and operate a wind energy facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially, the ZHB had denied the developer's first request. Subsequently, the county commissioners enacted amendments to the zoning ordnance, which allowed, by right, the use of wind energy facilities in certain districts. The developer filed an application for a zoning permit, which was granted. The objectors filed a substantive validity challenge to the zoning ordinance amendments, asserting that the amendments allowed a development that was judicially determined in prior special exception proceedings to be detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the community, that the use allowed by the amendments was unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to Pennsylvania law, and other challenges. The court upheld the ZHB's determination, finding that the objectors presented no evidence to carry their heavy burden of establishing the amendments were arbitrary and unreasonable or bore no substantial relationship to promoting the public health, safety, and welfare. The court further held the doctrine of collateral estoppel was inapplicable since the developer's special exception request was not identical to the issue presented in the objectors' validity challenge.</SPAN></P>

At a parole violation hearing, the inmate provided explanations for each item found. The Board recommitted the inmate to imprisonment as a technical parole violator. The inmate's request for administrative relief was denied. On appeal, the court found that unlike 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6312(d), the special condition regarding the photographs was violated where the camera held digital images of a child, whether the image was processed into a photograph or not. The inmate's explanation that his knife was a &quot;displayed curio&quot; was not deemed credible. Rather, he possessed a weapon which was a violation of his parole.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff ballroom challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County (Pennsylvania), which sustained the preliminary objections of defendant, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and dismissed its action against it and defendants, a county district attorney, a health department, and a township police department. The complaint sought to enjoin the enforcement of the Clean Indoor Air Act, 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 637.1 - 637.11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff operated a bingo hall and sought an injunction to prohibit defendants from enforcing the Act. Plaintiff primarily contended that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court sustained the preliminary objections of defendants for lack of jurisdiction upon concluding that the court had original and exclusive jurisdiction over the matter since the case involved the Commonwealth as a party. The court noted some procedural errors committed by the trial court and held that the Commonwealth was not an indispensable party in the action and that it did not have original jurisdiction over the action as pled. The court noted that simply naming the Commonwealth as a party, without naming any state agency, was insufficient to state a claim against a Commonwealth agency, specifically those agencies charged by the Commonwealth to enforce the Act. However, the court found that plaintiff sufficiently averred that the local agencies named as defendants were charged with enforcement of the Act and that the requested injunctive relief, if found to be warranted, could be awarded without participation in the action by any state entity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the action against the Commonwealth, but reversed its dismissal of the action as to the remaining defendants and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings against the named local agencies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a mother on behalf of her minor son and individually, sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), which determined that the minor lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of Chester, Pa., Ordinance art. 711, which was an anti-loitering ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor walked to a variety store that was in a &quot;high drug activity area.&quot; After he purchased snacks, he remained in the area, talking with other individuals. When two police officers on bikes approached, the minor and the others ran away. However, the minor stopped running and when one of the officers caught up to him, he allegedly cursed at the minor, struck him, and knocked him down. The minor was arrested and charged with loitering, in violation of art. 711. The criminal matter was dismissed for failure to prosecute, and the minor and his mother filed their civil action. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of art. 711 and dismissed the officer with prejudice. After an initial appeal was filed, the trial court vacated the prior order and dismissed the remaining claims. On appeal therefrom, the court held that the trial court erred in finding that the minor lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of art. 711. The minor suffered an injury directly attributable to art. 711, despite the fact that the charge was dismissed. Accordingly, he had standing to raise the issue. As the trial court did not consider the constitutionality issue, a remand was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner had a 21.27 acre parcel of property in a commercial zoning district and began operating a race track on the land, which was not a permitted use in a commercial zoning district. A zoning enforcement notice citing the landowner for the race track operation without a zoning permit was issued. The township denied the landowner's appeal for a permit, which was affirmed by the trial court. The landowner filed another appeal challenging the method by which the ordinance was enacted. The court held that because the landowner did not raise a procedural challenge regarding the ordinance in his first appeal, the issue was waived. The court held that even if the landowner had not waived the procedural attack on the ordinance and had been able to properly raise it in his second appeal, he still would not prevail on any of his alternative theories. Specifically, the trial court properly applied 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5571.1 and the landowner had every opportunity for years to attend a meeting and for months to view the ordinance and could have challenged it from its inception but he did not. By waiting four years, he was found time barred from challenging the validity of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania remanded the instant matter upon reversing a decision, finding that petitioners, banks and a bankers' association, lacked standing as intervenors in a proceeding, wherein respondent, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking (PDB), determined that respondents, two state-chartered credit unions (CUs), could convert their fields of membership pursuant to the Credit Union Code, 17 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 101-1504.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each of the CUs had a field of membership that consisted of select employer groups, and each sought charter conversion to serve a community field of membership based on, inter alia, the five-county geographical zone. A presiding officer for the PDB did not allow disclosure of all the CUs' documents to petitioners. It was determined that the five-county area constituted a &quot;well-defined local community&quot; under 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1759(g)(1) and 17 Pa.C.S. &sect; 501(e)(2) for each CU, and that petitioners' interests were not adversely impacted by the conversions. On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed that decision, finding that petitioners had standing as a public interest party. On remand, the court found no evidentiary ruling error by the PDB. Substantial evidence supported the PDB's finding under &sect; 1759(g)(1) and &sect; 501(e)(2) regarding a well-defined local community. The PDB properly handled the issue of tax consequences, made sufficient findings, and the improper taking of official notice was only harmless error. There was no due process violation by the failure to disclose all documents and information under 71 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 733-302(A)(2).</SPAN></P>

The court found merit in the business's position and reversed the Board upon finding that the MRI and PET/CT Scan systems were real estate structures within the meaning of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7201(nn). The court found that the business met its burden of showing an intention that the systems became a permanent part of the real estate as each system satisfied the three factors established in case law for a chattel that could be either personalty or realty. The court found that the business's evidence supported the conclusion that the chattels in the case, namely the MRI and PET/CT Scan systems, constituted realty, not personalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant City appealed an order entered by the Common Pleas Court of the County of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), which reversed the denial by the Zoning Board of Adjustment of the City of Philadelphia (ZBA) of appellee applicant's request for a variance, and granted the variance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the applicant did not show that the uses already permitted rendered the property valueless or incapable of being leased. The property was used for accessory parking and accessory signage, and there was a private parking lot at the property. The applicant did not prove the physical characteristics of the property were such that the property could not be used for a permitted purpose, or that the property had no value with respect to a permitted use. Evidence that the property was generating disappointing income did not establish hardship. The argument that the relaxed Hertzberg standard applied to cases in which variances were sought from Philadelphia, Pa., Zoning Code &sect; 14-1604's billboard regulations had been rejected. The applicant's proposal violated &sect; 14-1604 and was contrary to the public interest. The erroneous findings that a mattress showroom and an adult cabaret were on the property were not necessary to the lack of hardship finding, which was supported by the evidence. The applicant failed to preserve its constitutional claim based on  free commercial speech. The distinction between onsite and offsite advertising billboards was permissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were two individual debt settlement services providers (DSS Providers) and a trade group representing a number of DSS Providers and asserted that Act 117 was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to DSS Providers for a number of reasons. The primary gist of the challengers' arguments was that the Department has stated that it could not license DSS Providers until it promulgated regulations regarding debt settlement services and that such regulations could take months or years to be put in place after the effective date of Act 117, thereby prohibiting DSS Providers from being able to continue operating in the Commonwealth. The court sustained the Department's first preliminary objection as to the challengers' claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 since the Department was not a person for purposes of the statute to whom &sect; 1983 applied. Otherwise, the court overruled the remainder of the Department's preliminary objections since the challengers articulated their claims regarding Act 117 in a manner that it was possible they could be successful.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner lender brought suit against respondents banking department (department) and secretary, seeking to have a notice issued by the secretary declared unlawful and to enjoin the department and the secretary from implementing or enforcing it. The department counterclaimed, seeking a declaration that the lender's internet lending to Pennsylvania residents was unlawful. All parties moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The notice advised that engaging in nonmortgage consumer lending to Pennsylvania residents by any means, including by means of the internet or by mail, was engaging in such business in Pennsylvania as contemplated by 7 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6203. The lender argued initially that the notice was unlawful unpromulgated rulemaking. The court found that the notice merely interpreted &sect; 6203 and revised the department's interpretation in prior letters. The manner of adopting the change was consistent with the department's enforcement authority, and it reserved some discretion. The notice thus properly represented a policy statement. Further, the department's current interpretation was correct. The language of &sect; 6203 expanded coverage to encompass employees, agents, and brokers. The structure of &sect; 6203 made it unlawful for any unlicensed person to engage in negotiating or making specified types of loans, and it defined the persons whose conduct may fit this activity. By making payday loans, the lender was violating the Consumer Discount Company Act (CDCA) and the Loan Interest and Protection Law (LIPL), 41 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 201, by lending to Pennsylvania residents without a license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lender's application for summary relief was denied. The application for summary relief filed by the department and the secretary was granted. The court declared that the lender's operations were in violation of the CDCA and the LIPL. The court also declared that the lender's practice of making payday loans to Pennsylvania residents was not authorized by the laws of Pennsylvania and specifically violated the CDCA and LIPL.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a California charitable organization, appealed the final order of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, which imposed an administrative fine of $ 3,000 against it and ordered it to cease its fundraising and solicitation within the Commonwealth. Respondent, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Charitable Organizations, asserted petitioner violated the Solicitation of Funds for Charitable Purposes Act, 10 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 162.1-.23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order required that petitioner to cease its fundraising and solicitation within the Commonwealth until it paid the fine and complied with the registration, notification, and disclosure requirements of the Act. Petitioner challenged the constitutionality of the Act in several regards, asserted that the Secretary's findings were not supported by substantial evidence, and claimed that the Bureau was estopped from enforcing the Act against it. The court found no merit to petitioner's constitutional challenges to the Act but did find that the order required reversal, in part, since, under the circumstances of the case, the record reflected that the Bureau had sent a number of contradictory signals to petitioner regarding exactly what was required of it under 10 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 162.13(c) with regard to the address it listed on its solicitations. For example, the Bureau made no objection when petitioner submitted its application for registration and listed a mailing address rather than a street address, yet one year later, the Bureau sent it a letter stating that a violation occurred due to the address.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order insofar as it determined that petitioner violated the Act with regard to its address. The court further vacated the order insofar as it levied an administrative fine and remanded the case to the Secretary for it to reconsider the appropriate fine for each solicitation based on the violations the court affirmed. Otherwise, the court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county board of assessment appeals upheld the imposition and amount of the roll-back taxes imposed on appellant landowners, who appealed. The York County Common Pleas Court (Pennsylvania) held that the roll-back taxes were properly imposed under the Pennsylvania Farmland and Forest Land Assessment Act of 1974, 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5490.1 - 5490.13. The landowners sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tract at issue had enjoyed a &quot;clean and green&quot; preferential assessment under the Act for many years. After two of the landowners split off two acres from their parcel and deeded them to the third (their daughter), the county imposed roll-back taxes on all three landowners. The appellate court rejected the landowners' claim that the Act's provisions relating to roll-back taxes were unconstitutionally vague. Their theory that no roll-back taxes were owed by any of them ignored language in 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5490.6(a.1)(2) that each tract that had been split off would be subject to rollback taxes and that the landowner changing the use of the land would be liable. This targeted the third landowner's tract, and placed the tax burden on her, assuming she was the one responsible for the change in the property's use. The Act imposed roll-back taxes where a split-off parcel had been conveyed to a third party, even though, as here, the use of the split-off parcel satisfied the criteria in &sect; 5490.6(a.1)(1)(i).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by appellees, an association and its members, the Common Pleas Court of the County of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) permanently enjoined appellant city from enforcing two ordinances regulating the transfer and possession of firearms.

The city appealed and the association and members cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association and the members argued that the ordinances were unconstitutional and were preempted by 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6120(a). The trial court permanently enjoined the city from enforcing ordinances which prohibited the possession, sale, and transfer of certain types of guns, including assault weapons, and which prohibited purchase of a handgun through a straw purchaser. Initially, the appellate court agreed with the trial court's ruling that the association and the members failed to establish sufficient injury to confer standing with respect to the other three ordinances, which authorized temporary removal of guns from persons found to pose a risk of imminent harm, which prohibited persons subject to an abuse order from acquiring or possessing guns, and which imposed notice requirements on owners whose guns were lost or stolen. With regards to the remaining two ordinances, while &sect; 6120(a) appeared to have been limited to the lawful use of guns by its terms, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had held that the general assembly, through enactment of &sect; 6120(a), had denied all municipalities the power to regulate the ownership, possession, transfer, or transportation of firearms.</SPAN></P>

The Attorney General asserted that the township violated the Agriculture Code, 3 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 311-318, by adopting and enforcing an unauthorized local ordinance that prohibited or limited normal agricultural operations (NAOs) without the authority of state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suit arose from a complaint made to the Attorney General by certain residents of the township who sought to engage in a chicken operation as a NAO. However, under the township's ordinance, the residents' proposed operation was characterized as an intensive agricultural activity (IAA). In support of its motion, the township argued that it was entitled to a judgment on the pleadings because the Attorney General had failed to aver any facts that would support the conclusion that the township had applied or enforced the ordinance against the residents in a manner inconsistent with state law. The court disagreed, finding that the Attorney General sufficiently averred that the ordinance failed to provide any guidance as to how the township determined when activities associated with a NAO intensified to the level that transformed into an IAA and other ambiguous provisions. The court also found that granting the motion was improper since a factual dispute existed over the term commercial composting, which was not defined in the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the township's motion in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner accountant challenged the adjudication of respondent, the Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs, State Board of Accountancy (the Board), which revoked the accountant's license and certificate of certified public accountant (CPA) to practice public accounting in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board revoked the accountant's license because of his 2002 criminal harassment conviction in the State of Illinois, which involved him leaving a telephone message indicating his disagreement with homosexuality on the answering machine of an individual who was the executive director of a community organization. On appeal, the accountant asserted that the Board abused its discretion by imposing the maximum penalty of revocation of his CPA credentials and that it erred by finding that he was not rehabilitated from his offending conduct. The court held that the Board had grounds to impose a sanction upon the accountant for violating  63 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.9a(a)(5) but that the Board abused its discretion by imposing the most drastic available sanction. The court stated that complete revocation of a CPA's credentials should be a sanction reserved for the worst offenders. The court held that a lesser sanction, such as a short-term suspension of the accountant's license or imposition of a civil penalty was more appropriate, with such sanctions not exceeding the severity of the criminal sanctions imposed for the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner said its challenges should be deemed approved because the board did not mail a decision upholding the ordinances within one day, under 53 Pa.

The appellate court disagreed because (1) no statutory noncompliance consequence was prescribed, (2) no constitutional violation occurred, (3) the statute was directory, not mandatory, and (4) other measures could cure a violation. If the board's findings were not specific enough, under 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10908(9), the error was harmless because it accepted the landowner's evidence. If certain findings were absent, a remand, not a reversal, was the remedy. Enactment defects did not make the ordinances void ab initio because (1) they were properly recorded, (2) lack of a prior challenge to procedures used to adopt them showed they were obeyed, (3) nearly 3,000 permits issued under them showed they were acquiesced to, (4) ordinances over eight years old existed long enough to presume that notice or acquiescence occurred, and, (5) the turmoil from invalidating ordinances less than eight years old would be more harmful than not applying the void ab initio doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a developer and a landowner, filed a complaint against appellees, a township and a zoning hearing board, in the Common Pleas Court of the County of Berks (Pennsylvania), alleging that the board's members did not file statements of financial interests as required by 65 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1104. The trial court granted the township's and the board's preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint. The developer and the owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer and the owner claimed that as the members of the zoning hearing board failed to file statements of financial interests and failed to take the required oath, as required by &sect; 1104 of the Pennsylvania Public Official and Employee Ethics Act, 65 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1104, they were not vested with the authority of the quasi-judicial office to which they were appointed. Therefore, the board was without authority to render a decision as to the developer's and the owner's request for a special exception, thereby rendering a prior decision which the board issued null and void. As the board's decision was null and void, the developer and the owner alleged that the board failed to timely rule on their special exception application and that the application was, therefore, to be deemed approved. On appeal, the court found that the claims that the board members failed to take an oath or failed to file financial statements did not establish any violation of the developer's and the owner's constitutional rights. Therefore, the void ab initio doctrine was not applicable to the action. Furthermore, the de facto doctrine applied to the action and the board's decision was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioner Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH) permission to file an interlocutory appeal of the order of the Board of Claims (Pennsylvania), which overruled the DOH's preliminary objections to the statement of claim filed by respondent corporation for damages under promissory estoppel and quasi-contract theories for services performed in regard to its development of a software system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the Board had subject matter jurisdiction over quasi-contract claims against the Commonwealth that were not based on a written agreement under 62 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1724(a)(1). The DOH argued that 62 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1724(a)(1) plainly granted jurisdiction in the Board only over claims arising from contracts, and that, pursuant to the general definition of &quot;contract&quot; in 62 Pa.C.S. &sect; 103, the Board lacked jurisdiction because no written executed agreement existed between the parties. The corporation argued that the Board's jurisdiction over quasi-contract claims had not been extinguished and that, under the Commonwealth Procurement Code, a contract was not always a written agreement. The court concluded that the Board did not commit an error of law in overruling the DOH's preliminary objections based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the court agreed with the corporation that applying the definition of the term &quot;contract&quot; in 62 Pa.C.S. &sect; 103 to the provisions in Chapter 17 would deprive the Board of its ability to determine whether a valid contract existed, either express or implied. Thus, the corporation's quasi-contract claims had to be resolved by the Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Board's order and remanded the matter for the Board to proceed with the corporation's claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant borough appealed an order by the Common Pleas Court of the County of Bucks (Pennsylvania) that affirmed a denial of nunc pro tunc relief by appellee county board of assessment appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the borough acquired three parcels of land from a memorial fund, the board issued a separate assessment notice for each of the parcels that gave new assessment values and listed the reason for each change. The board mistakenly sent the notices to the prior owners, who then forwarded the notices to the borough. Although the borough did not file an appeal, its counsel inquired with the board, prior to the deadline, as to the records relating to the parcels. The board official's response reasonably left the impression that the board was aware of the change in ownership and that it would not be necessary for the borough to follow the formal procedures for correcting disputed information in the notices. When the borough learned that the board had not given the parcels tax exempt status, it sought nunc pro tunc relief. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the statement by the board official created a reasonable presumption that the ownership issue was corrected, and also reasonably implied that the parcels were exempt from taxation under 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5020-204(a)(7). Accordingly, the borough's request to appeal nunc pro tunc should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case involving the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act (AEPS), 73 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 1648.1-1648.8, an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that  alternative energy credits produced by non-utility generators (NUGs) were owned by electric distribution companies (EDCs). Respondent Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) adopted the ALJ's opinion. Petitioner, a non-profit entity whose members were NUGs, petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was who owned alternative energy credits when a power purchase agreement (PPA) was silent on the issue. The appellate court concluded that the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-617, &sect; 2, 92 Stat. 3119 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 15, 16, and 30 U.S.C.S.), which precluded state reformation of PPAs, did not preempt the PUC's authority to determine ownership of alternative energy credits because the PUC had not modified the terms of an existing contract, but had determined ownership of assets which were not previously contemplated. Also, the PUC had jurisdiction because, considering the unique nature of alternative energy credits and the AEPS provision for the PUC's extensive oversight of them, resolving the dispute was not a matter of ordinary contract interpretation, but a process that implicated the PUC's particular expertise. Finally, the PUC did not err in concluding that EDCs owned the credits because the purpose of the AEPS was to encourage the creation and use of energy from alternative sources. Where the EDC had already purchased energy from a NUG, the underlying purpose of the AEPS had been satisfied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PUC's order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employer petitioned for review of an order of the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry, which denied a review of the employer's compensation contribution rates, and affirmed respondent Pennsylvania Office of Unemployment Compensation Tax Services' transfer of corporation one's experience record and reserve account balance to the employer under the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law, 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 751-914.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the stock in corporation one was purchased by to the employer on December 31, 2002. A 2005 change in ownership of the employer was irrelevant. The finding that the employer was not a new employer was supported by substantial evidence that corporation one's co-owner was a shareholder in the employer. Despite its requests, the employer did not receive corporation one's unemployment compensation claims until the Department found that corporation one's experience record and reserve account balance had to be transferred to the employer. The employer sufficiently raised the issue of the constitutionality of the Department's failure to provide corporation one's notices. The Department did not violate the employer's due process rights. The claim that the employer suffered injury due to the failure to give notice of claims was speculative. Further, the employer failed to raise a constitutionally protected property interest as the delay in transferring the reserve account balance was the direct result of the employer's misrepresentations to the Department that there was no common ownership between the employer and corporation one at the time of its transfer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Counsel seeking to withdraw from representation of a petitioner seeking review of the Board's determination had to provide a &quot;no-merit&quot; letter, detailing the nature and extent of counsel's review and listing each issue the inmate wished to raise, with counsel's explanation of why those issues were meritless. The commonwealth court held that counsel's no-merit letter did not address all of the inmate's arguments and did not provide a substantive explanation of why the issues it did raise were meritless. Although the inmate's claim that he was not advised that the Board would be able to alter his plea agreement could be meritless, it was still incumbent upon counsel to include it in the no-merit letter and explain why it was meritless. While the letter did cite statutory authority for the principle that the inmate could not serve his State and county sentences at the same time, it did not provide any substantive authority supporting the Board's determination that the inmate was not available to serve his State sentence until April 22, 2008, even though the Board had already recommitted him as of July 25, 2007.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner appealed an order by the Common Pleas Court of the County of Clinton (Pennsylvania) that fined him $ 500 for violating 34 Pa. C.S. &sect;2307(a); the owner claimed, inter alia, that 34 Pa. C.S. &sect;&sect;2307 and 2121 impermissibly infringed upon his constitutional rights to protect his property against damage and to equal protection under the law, and that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence presented at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner shot and killed an elk that was allegedly eating one of his fruit trees during the closed season. Thereafter, the owner was cited the owner for killing an elk out of season. The owner testified that he would not use the non-lethal ways to discourage elk from entering his property because he was told that the Commission was out of money and that the cracker shot and rubber pellets could damage his gun. The owner acknowledged that he did not cultivate his fruit trees as a primary means of gaining his livelihood, and, thus, he was not a &quot;person&quot; entitled to the exception to &sect;2307 set forth in &sect;2121(a). Although the owner observed the same elk on his property for a week, and, although he was concerned that the elk would damage his fruit trees, he did not contact the Commission or take any other protective measures before shooting the elk. The appellate court found that, under the circumstances, the trial court properly fined the owner for shooting the elk during the closed season without justification. The appellate court declined to address either of the constitutional issues or the owner's evidentiary issue.</SPAN></P>
