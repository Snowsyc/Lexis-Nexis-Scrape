Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The trial court erred by dismissing plaintiff home buyers' fraud claim against the sellers, who allegedly said they were moving to be closer to friends when their real reason was that a sex offender lived next door; the claim was not barred by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-2156(A), which relieved buyers of the duty to disclose nearby sex offenders, and the contract's integration clause could not shield the sellers from liability for fraud; [2]-Plaintiffs' claim that the sellers negligently failed to disclose the sex offender's proximity was not protected by Ariz. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 6's anti-abrogation clause, as the common law did not impose such a duty on seller not in a special relationship with a buyer; [3]-Plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claim against a broker was properly dismissed, as the brokerage contract stated it had no obligation to disclose sex offenders.</SPAN></P>

R. Evid. 403 because it was not especially probative on the question of the victim's legal capacity to consent to sexual activity, as it tended to show that the victim did not have knowledge about sex; [3]-The trial court did not err by sentencing defendant as a category two repetitive offender and in finding that his 1992 conviction from Washington was a historical prior felony conviction under former Ariz.

The appellate court agreed because the Arizona Constitution's text and structure did not expressly or impliedly bar such an application, as the legislature had plenary power to enact laws that did not interfere with the Constitution, since express grants of legislative authority were unnecessary, and the IRC's uniqueness did not favor determining it was not subject to the OML.</SPAN></P>

The legislature essentially rewrote the rule to codify Daubert and adopted the federal test for determining the admissibility of expert testimony, a test the Arizona Supreme Court rejected. The statute provided an analytical framework contrary to the rules of evidence. The statute supplanted the existing rule with which it conflicted and therefore was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found the victim's initial allegations to police had been corroborated by physical evidence, the arrest and charges had been supported by probable cause when they were made, and neither the arrest nor the charges had been unlawful or illegal under the circumstances. Defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion because it applied an incorrect legal standard when ruling on his motion and it did not fully evaluate the evidence presented at the hearing. The appellate court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4051 provided a remedy intended to benefit the person seeking relief. The trial court erred in failing to consider defendant's arguments that he was falsely accused and actually innocent of the crimes with which he was charged. Any determination that defendant was factually innocent would be unsupported by and contrary to the record, even when viewing it in the light most favorable to defendant's claims. Remanding the matter for reconsideration under the proper standard, therefore, was not required.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers owned a hotel and golf courses built pursuant to ground leases from the State of Arizona. The leases allowed the taxpayers to remove or demolish improvements, prohibited waste, and required that the premises be kept in good condition and surrendered upon termination. The court held that the more favorable class nine tax rate under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-12009 (2006) applied because the provision allowing removal of improvements did not vitiate the reversionary interest. Section 42-12009 required the existence of a demonstrable reversionary interest at the time of taxation but did not mandate an inviolable guarantee that the improvements would revert. In light of the prohibition against waste, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and the constraints imposed by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 37-281(D) (2003), 37-322.03(A) (2003), the taxpayers' ability to destroy the improvements was circumscribed. The proceeding was one for error correction under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-16251(3)(b) (Supp. 2010) and was timely. In accordance with Ariz. R. Civ. App. P. 13(b)(3), the county could not challenge a primary use determination under &sect; 42-12009(A)(1)(b) absent a cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with and convicted of numerous offenses stemming from his sexual abuse of his stepdaughter. On review, the court held that the trial court did not err under Ariz. R. Evid. 404 in permitting the State to introduce other crimes evidence because evidence that defendant had sexually assaulted his stepdaughter in uncharged incidents was relevant. In a sexual offense case involving a minor victim, evidence of prior acts against the same minor victim was undoubtedly admissible, either as propensity evidence or because it was so much part and parcel of the criminal acts charged. Further, the trial court did not err in precluding defendant from introducing evidence of the victim's sexual history, including evidence of the victim engaged in sexual contact with a female friend and engaged in sexual intercourse with her boyfriend. Whether the victim engaged in consensual sexual contact was irrelevant to the issue of whether defendant had committed the charged sexual acts and was further precluded by the rape shield law, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1421.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant's wife filed an application for an involuntary evaluation under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-520, two psychiatrists performed evaluations in separate 30-minute interviews. One psychiatrist conducted the evaluation while in the same room with appellant, but the other conducted the evaluation remotely through a telemedicine system that used video conferencing technology. Appellant argued that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 36-533(B), 36-539(B), and 36-501(14) were not complied with because the second psychiatrist did not perform a complete physical examination in person. The court agreed and vacated the order of involuntary commitment, noting that the statutory requirements had to be strictly complied with. While the State argued that the mental health statutes conflicted with Ariz. R. Evid. 702 and 703, no violation of separation of powers existed as the statutes did not govern the admissibility or relevance of expert testimony but established substantive elements for an involuntary commitment; any expert witness qualified under the evidence rules could be called to testify in an involuntary commitment action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, ruled in favor of appellee agricultural producers on their suit against appellants, Arizona Governor and Arizona State Treasurer, alleging that House Bill 2620 was unconstitutional. The trial court ordered the Governor to return the monies transferred from the Agricultural Funds. The Governor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor argued that HB 2620 was constitutional legislation that permitted the transfer of the Agricultural Funds to the general fund. The appellate court noted that no express provision of the Arizona Constitution limited the legislature's power over the Agricultural Funds. The enabling statutes for the Agricultural Funds limited how the Councils could spend their money, they were not limits on the legislature's authority. The enabling statutes did not meet the general requirements for a trust and the appellate court declined to read a trust relationship into the Agricultural Funds' statutes that was not explicitly stated. The primary intent of the reference to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 35-313 appeared to allow the Councils to receive interest on their account balances. The funds were not held in custodial capacity. They were not used for the sole benefit of the crop producers who paid the fees or any donors who donated monies. The growers did not have a protectable privacy interest in the Agricultural Funds. Ariz. Const. art. 9, &sect;&sect; 3 and 9 did not apply because even if the fees were taxes, they would be excise taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Pinal County, Arizona, affirmed appellee Arizona Game and Fish Commission's (Commission) decision revoking appellant hunter's hunting, fishing and trapping licenses and denying him the right to secure additional licenses for a period of ten years consecutive to a previously imposed revocation term. The hunter appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hunter argued that the Commission lacked the statutory authority under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-340 to impose consecutive sanctions and lacked jurisdiction to revoke his previously revoked licenses. The appellate court found that because the statute's language did not grant the Commission the express power to impose consecutive sanctions, and further because the legislature considered and rejected that power, &sect; 17-340(B) did not grant the Commission authority to impose consecutive sanctions on offenders for repeat offenses. The statute granted the Commission authority to sanction persons convicted of violations of game and fish laws and did not exclude from the Commission's jurisdiction persons who previously had been convicted of a violation, but have not yet completed a prior revocation or suspension period. Apart from making the sanctions consecutive, imposing on the hunter the sanctions themselves was a valid exercise of the Commission's powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to the portion of the order finding the Commission had the authority to impose consecutive sanctions; the remainder of the order was affirmed.

The probation officer directed the probationer to enroll in a sex offender treatment program that included periodic polygraph examinations. The probationer filed a motion to preclude polygraph examination and pre-polygraph questionnaire, arguing that requiring him to answer all the questions violated his rights under the U.S. Const. amend.

The State could not require the probationer to waive his Fifth Amendment rights as a condition of probation and could not require him to answer questions that could incriminate him in future proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a county sheriff and a county attorney, challenged a ruling from the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona), which denied their motion for summary judgment; granted summary judgment to appellees, a county board of supervisors and the State of Arizona; and dismissed their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief alleging unlawful use of funds that had been intended for the use of the county sheriff and the county attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To comply with the funding requirements of 2008 Ariz. Sess. Laws 288, the county board of supervisors voted to transfer sums from special revenue funds into the State's general fund. The sheriff, in seeking declaratory relief, did not file a notice of claim. After the superior court ruled that the transfer was lawful, the county transferred the funds to the State. The court determined that the appeal was moot because the State had spent the funds. Moreover, to the extent a favorable declaration might allow the sheriff to seek recovery of money from the State, such a claim would require compliance with the notice of claim statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-821.01 (2003), which the State had not waived. The court nevertheless exercised its discretion to address the merits of the appeal to provide future guidance. The court found no error in the superior court's conclusion that the sums were public funds and were not funds held in trust by the county; as such, their use could be redirected with no statutory amendment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with five counts of first-degree murder, and the State filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty. Defendant filed a motion for an ex parte hearing to address issues related to mitigation and asserted that the State had no right to be present at the hearing. The murder victims' family members objected, asserting that, under the Victims' Bill of Rights, any ex parte hearing that excluded victims was unconstitutional and that victims had a constitutional and statutory right to attend any criminal proceeding at which defendant had a right to be present. After the trial court granted the request for an ex parte hearing, the family members filed a petition for a special action. On review, the court held that the family members of the murder victims were themselves victims under Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 2.1(C), and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4401(19) (2010) and thus had a right to be present at the hearing on mitigation matters. The Arizona Constitution unquestionably gave victims the right to be present at &quot;all criminal proceedings,&quot; and the courts were required to follow and apply the plain language of the Victims' Bill of Rights in interpreting its scope.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, that convicted him of second-degree murder, arguing that the superior court committed fundamental error in instructing the jury that he had the burden to prove a justification defense in light of 2006 Sess. Laws ch. 199 and 2009 Sess. Laws ch. 190, which shifted the burden of proof on justification defenses to the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the State conceded that the Chapters 190 and 199 retroactively shifted the burden of proof on justification defenses under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-205 to the State and that the new legislation applied, it nevertheless argued a violation of the separation of powers clause of Ariz. Const. art. III. On review, the court held that the legislation did not violate the separation of powers clause. Generally, the legislature had the power to retroactively apply a statute granting criminal defendants a more lenient burden of proof on justification, but once the state supreme court rendered a final judgment interpreting the statute, the legislature could not later retroactively construe what the statute meant in conflict with the judicial decision. However, because the substantive legislative purpose was not to overrule a judicial decision or to preclude judicial decision-making but to exercise its right to make a law retroactive, the legislature could do so without violating separation of powers, provided that the amendment did not retroactively narrow or limit a criminal defendant's rights or disturb vested rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the trial court committed fundamental error in instructing the jury that defendant had the burden of proof on the justification defense, the judgment of conviction was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court declined to consider the father's equal protection argument because it was not raised before the trial court. The father did not explicitly make his anti-abrogation argument until his motion for reconsideration. Under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3620, the father presented no evidence that the counselor did not reasonably believe the child had been sexually abused. He presented no evidence that the counselor, nurse, and supervisor were motivated by any malice toward him. The trial court did not err in granting these appellees summary judgment based on the qualified immunity provided by &sect; 13-3620 J. The father never established that the advocacy center owed a duty to him or breached a standard of care based on the center's minimal involvement. In treating an alleged abuse victim, the counselor, as a health care professional, owed no duty of care to the father, an alleged third-party abuser. The counselor, while not licensed, was practicing as a counselor, a position for which she had education, training, and experience.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was released to work with physical restrictions after a back injury. His treating orthopedic surgeon and an independent medical examiner, in presenting expert medical testimony at the administrative review hearing, relied on different editions of the American Medical Association (AMA) Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment. The court construed Ariz. Admin. Code 20-5-113(B) to require the use of the edition in effect at the time an injured worker's medical condition was evaluated for the existence of ratable permanent impairment. Thus, the conflict was properly resolved in favor of the testimony of the independent medical examiner, who had used the edition in effect at the time of the evaluation. Rule 20-5-113(B) did not unlawfully delegate to the AMA the agency's rulemaking authority under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-921(B) (1995) because physicians had discretion to use other appropriate rating criteria and the use of periodically updated expert standards was a practical necessity. Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 8 was not violated because the use of the more recent edition did not categorically deprive the claimant of a class of benefits to which he had been entitled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a personal injury suit, plaintiff appealed summary judgment granted by the Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, in favor of defendants police department, individual police officers, and county medical center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was injured in an altercation with police officers and was transferred to the county medical center, where he allegedly received negligent care. He filed suit against the police department, the officers involved, and the county medical center. All defendants moved to dismiss. On review, the court held that, because the superior court considered documents outside of the pleadings, the motions to dismiss were converted into motions for summary judgment. Summary judgment was properly granted as to the police officers because plaintiff failed to comply with the notice of claim statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-821.01 (2003). Although plaintiff submitted notice to the city, he failed to serve pre-suit notice upon any individual police officer. However, summary judgment as to the police department and county hospital was improper. The proper entities to be named as defendants were the city and the county health care district; although they were not properly named in the complaint, plaintiff properly effected service of process upon them. The remedy for this mere technical error was an amendment pursuant to Ariz. R. Civ. P. 10(f) and not a dismissal or summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court's entry of summary judgment in favor of the individual police officers was affirmed, but summary judgment in favor of the police department and county medical center was reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">2008 Ariz. Sess. Laws, 2d Reg. Sess. ch. 288, &sect; 10, required each county to transfer a sum of money to the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Administration. The bill was later amended to provide for deposit of the transferred monies into the general fund of the State of Arizona. Appellants sought injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment, alleging the board unlawfully seized more than $ 24 million from special revenue funds. The appellate court disagreed with the argument that the superior court erred in finding the board had the legal authority to seize and transfer the designated funds to the State. As public monies, the statutory funds were subject to the Arizona Legislature's power to amend their appropriation, as exercised here through the bill. Also, since the board was acting on a lawful Legislative mandate which temporarily revoked limitations on the funds' use, the superior court properly refused to grant injunctive relief. Furthermore, the bill did not create new revenue as contemplated by Ariz. Const. art. IX, &sect; 22, and therefore did not require a super-majority vote of the Legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After obtaining and executing a search warrant for appellant and his sole proprietorship, the State brought an action for forfeiture of certain property seized as a result of the search. Appellant moved to controvert the grounds upon which the search warrant had been issued and to recover property he alleged had been seized illegally. The Pima County Superior Court, Arizona, dismissed the motion. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the trial court's conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion to controvert was predicated on an erroneous interpretation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3922. Appellant argued that, because &sect; 13-3922(A) refers only to the taking of testimony, a pending proceeding for forfeiture of the same property interest merely precludes the taking of testimony, but otherwise does not preclude the magistrate from ruling on the motion to controvert. The court agreed with the essence of appellant's interpretation. If a forfeiture action is pending, the magistrate is precluded only from taking testimony. Nothing in the statute's plain language suggests the magistrate also is precluded from deciding the motion on the papers. The trial court erred in dismissing appellant's motion to controvert. The trial court could take testimony, if offered, relevant to appellant's motion as it related to the search of his business records.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Pinal County, Arizona, granted defendants', Maricopa County, sheriff, Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO), and seven individual MCSO and county employees, motions for summary judgment on plaintiff daughter's wrongful death and survival action arising from the death of her mother. The daughter appealed; defendants cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that no Arizona statute conferred power on MCSO to sue and be sued; it was a nonjural entity and had to be dismissed. The daughter failed to allege a constitutionally protected right and thus lacked standing to bring a wrongful death action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. She produced sufficient facts for a jury to find that a Maricopa County Correctional Health Services (CHS) nurse and the named detention officers failed to act despite their knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm to the mother. There was sufficient evidence to find the nurse and detention officers liable under a deliberate indifference standard. A jury could find that the sheriff was aware that his actions or inactions posed a substantial risk of harm to inmates with serious medical needs in Maricopa County jails. The county was aware of and disregarded systemic and gross deficiencies in CHS staffing and procedures. Qualified immunity asserted by the detention officers, nurse, and sheriff in his individual capacity was not available. Nothing precluded awards of punitive damages against the individual defendants. The trial court did not err in its resolution of two discovery disputes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment in favor of all defendants on the daughter's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 survival claims and her associated claims for damages and in favor of the nurse on the daughter's state claims was reversed. The entry of summary judgment in favor of the daughter with respect to her standing to bring a wrongful death action pursuant to &sect; 1983 and its denial of the defendants' motion to dismiss MCSO was reversed. All other issues were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit involving the navigability of a river and title to river bedlands, appellant, the State of Arizona, challenged the judgment of the Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, that upheld an administrative determination that the river was not navigable at the inception of statehood and that, as such, title to the bedlands vested in appellees, the neighboring riparian owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose between the State of Arizona and riparian owners of land adjacent to river beds (bedlands) regarding ownership. If the river at issue was navigable in its ordinary and natural condition, title to the bedlands passed to the State from the federal government at statehood in 1912, and the State retained title. If the river was not navigable at that time, the neighboring riparian owners held title. On review of the superior court judgment ruling that the river was not navigable in 1912, the court held that, in order to determine whether the river was navigable under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-1101(5) (2003), the river had to be evaluated in both its ordinary (i.e., usual, absent major flooding or drought) and natural (i.e., without man-made dams, canals, or other diversions) condition. Because the administrative determination focused on the ordinary condition of the river and discounted an analysis of the river's natural condition, the administrative determination of the navigation issue failed to meet the statutory requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court's judgment affirming the administrative determination that the river was non-navigable in 1912 was vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that, except for the criminal penalties found in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-418(E), the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 651 et seq., savings clause, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 653(b)(4), preempted the State from prosecuting employers under the Arizona Criminal Code for manslaughter, aggravated assault and endangerment (Title 13 offenses) for failure to provide safe working conditions under the standards set forth in the Arizona Occupational Safety and Health Act (AOSHA), Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 23-401 et seq. The supreme court found that the savings clause did not preclude other criminal prosecution. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-418(E) was not the exclusive criminal penalty for an employer's failure to discharge its statutory duty to provide a safe workplace. The company was a person for purposes of imposing criminal liability for Title 13 offenses. The State presented substantial evidence that two high managerial agents engaged in acts and/or failed to act with the culpable mental states necessary to meet the statutory elements of each offense. The jury was correctly instructed. The fines and penalty assessments imposed by the court were not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer concluded a traffic stop. As defendant began walking back to his car, the officer asked to speak with him again. The officer asked for permission to search the vehicle, and defendant declined. The officer asked if defendant would consent to a narcotics dog sniff of the car, and defendant again declined. The officer then grabbed defendant by the arm and told him that he was being detained. A subsequent search of defendant's vehicle uncovered narcotics. On review of defendant's conviction, the court held that the post-traffic stop detention was not de minimus. The officer used physical force to detain defendant and then compelled him to await for the arrival of a second officer before conducting the sniff search. Further, the continued detention of defendant after he declined to allow a search was an additional seizure under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. IV. Because the lawful traffic stop had been concluded, the officer was required to have reasonable cause to initiate the second detention, and the totality of the circumstances failed to give rise to a reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify defendant's continued detention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city police officer observed defendant urinating in an alleyway behind a store and issued a citation to him for violating Tucson, Ariz., City Code &sect; 11-54, which prohibited any person from urinating or defecating in public.

The clear language of the ordinance was not rendered unconstitutionally vague because there was a theoretical potential for arbitrary enforcement and some assessment by law enforcement officers would be required, and the court concluded that police officers were capable of properly assessing the difference between public and private.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was charged with violating Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-507 after conflicts with a teacher in which he called her teacher a &quot;bitch&quot; and used profanity. On review of the delinquency adjudication, the court noted that the case involved a prosecution based on pure speech and concluded that the juvenile court erred in ruling that the juvenile's speech fell outside First Amendment parameters. While the juvenile may have called the teacher degrading names, the relative lack of substance in the juvenile's speech did not deprive it of First Amendment protection for purposes of criminal prosecution. However, the court rejected defendant's overbreadth argument. While the statute could be read to criminalize protected speech, the court had an obligation to save the statute by construing it in a manner that did not violate the U.S. Constitution. Because the statute could withstand a First Amendment challenge in prosecutions involving pure speech by limiting its reach to fighting words, the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad. Because the juvenile, in one of the conflicts, used language that amounted to fighting words, that speech was not protected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In July 2004, a jury found defendant guilty of possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Although he had appeared for the first two days of trial, he failed to appear on the third day. In August 2004, defendant was tried by a jury in absentia and found guilty of, inter alia, possession of a narcotic drug for sale. Warrants were issued for defendant's arrest in both cases, but he was not apprehended until October 2008. The trial court sentenced defendant in December 2008. The State argued that the appellate court could conclude defendant waived his right to appeal by his mere voluntary absence before sentencing. The appellate court ruled that defendant's failure to appear for sentencing did not itself demonstrate a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his right to appeal. The appellate court could not characterize defendant's mere conduct in absconding before sentencing as a knowing and intelligent waiver of his constitutional right to appeal. Application of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4033(C) to preclude defendant from a direct appeal would deny him his right to appeal under Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 24 without personal notice of this potential consequence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the age of 11, the juvenile was charged by delinquency petition with nine county of different sexual acts with a minor. He was adjudicated delinquent after entering into a plea agreement with the State, admitting that he committed sexual assault in exchange for the dismissal of the remaining charges. The juvenile was placed on probation, ordered to obtain in-patient treatment, and required to register as a sex offender. Two years later, the juvenile court released the juvenile from probation, conducted hearings, and granted the juvenile's motion requesting that the registration requirement be terminated. On review, the court held that, under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3821(G), the juvenile court was vested with the discretion to terminate the juvenile's registration requirement where the offense was committed by a juvenile under the age of 18 and where the juvenile successfully completed probation. The juvenile court had the statutory authority to require the juvenile to register as a sex offender and the authority to terminate that requirement when it found that the juvenile had been sufficiently rehabilitated.</SPAN></P>

P. 31.18, the appellate court could suspend the requirements of Rule 31 in exceptional circumstances. The significant change in the law qualified as such a circumstance. Defendant argued that a recent change in the law entitled him to a new trial. He argued that through Senate Bill 1449, 2006 Ariz. Sess. Laws 199, the legislature made its 2006 amendment to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-205(A) retroactively applicable to his case, which changed the burden of proof regarding self-defense. The appellate court noted that the burden of proof in justification defense cases shifted to the state only when the offense at issue was committed on or after April 24, 2006. Any attempt by the Arizona legislature to adjudicate pending cases by defining existing law and applying it to fact was prohibited. The enactment of Senate Bill 1449 did not encompass the doctrine of abatement.</SPAN></P>

Defendant failed to present any evidence that the program and manual had lacked medial oversight at their creation. Defendant's expert did not comment on hygienic conditions attending blood draws under the DPS program. Departmental protocols were regularly reviewed and revised in light of changes in the law and in technology.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an interview with detectives, defendant said &quot;I think I need a lawyer&quot; and &quot;Do I need a lawyer?&quot; Defendant's statements did not constitute an unambiguous request for counsel; therefore, he was not permitted to suppress his statements. During his trial for theft and burglary, the prosecutor's closing remarks concerning the quality of the State's evidence and the tools defendant used to commit the burglary did not constitute improper vouching for witnesses. The trial court's premature entry of a restitution order constituted an illegal sentence. The jury found defendant had stolen a truck while on probation and had a prior felony conviction. The trial court sentenced defendant to an enhanced sentence. Because the trial court could not aggravate defendant's sentence solely on the basis of his probation status, and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-702(C)(24), the catch-all statute for aggravating factors, was patently vague, the Court of Appeals of Arizona held that defendant's sentence for theft was an illegal sentence. The third-degree burglary statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1506(A)(1), was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate cases, appellee buyers sued appellant sellers when the sellers attempted to extract themselves from their respective contracts to purchase real property by invoking Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-422 (Supp. 2008)'s express disclosure requirement, and the sellers refused to rescind. In each case, the Superior Court in Maricopa County, Washington, granted the buyers' motions for summary judgment. The sellers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated review, each seller contended the summary judgments were improper, arguing, inter alia, that an affidavit of disclosure was not required because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-422 (Supp. 2008) was inapplicable based on the size of the property at issue, and &sect; 33-422 was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court disagreed in part, holding that the statute was not impermissibly vague as it provided that a seller had to disclose specific items of information to the best of his or her knowledge, and a person of ordinary intelligence would have understood that the statute required responsive answers to the questions asked; furthermore, the statute did not unconstitutionally impair the sellers' right to contract. The appellate court further held that in two of the cases, the buyers allowed their statutory rescission rights to lapse and, therefore, they were bound by the terms of their contracts. However, in the third case, the sellers' right to rescind was validly invoked, and summary judgment in favor of the buyers was improper as they did not first demand compliance with the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court's judgment was vacated, reversed, and remanded for entry of judgment in favor of one set of sellers where the superior court erroneously allowed rescission of the transactions; in the other cases, the summary judgments were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The holdings company purchased 453 acres in the county, planning to develop the land. The county and the developer entered into an agreement establishing permitted uses for the property, among other things. On review, the appellate court was asked to decide whether a county could subject its disputes under a contract to judicial review pursuant to the ARA by a term of the contract if the ARA would not otherwise apply. The agreement purported to bar any other mean of dispute resolution relating to an alleged breach of contract. The appellate court concluded that portion of the agreement was unenforceable. The county conceded that it was not an administrative agency for the purposes of the ARA. Further, a development agreement was not a rule or regulation. Absent statutory authority, the county and the developer could not agree to confer jurisdiction on the superior court. Moreover, the county had not promulgated a rule rendering the ARA applicable. More importantly, it had not enacted a rule that was supported by and implicated a statute that expressly gave the superior court subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the ARA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dam was built to divert water from a river for irrigating farmland. During flooding, landowners located within the river's floodplain upstream from the dam suffered extensive damage to their properties. Through projects that removed vegetation and created a more direct path for the river, the District redirected floodwaters. Nevertheless, the farmers alleged that the District's flood control project subsequently contributed to the dam's failure and to sedimentation that damaged their properties. Regarding the farmer's JMOL motions, the farmers argued that the District constructed a public improvement and therefore the liability jury only had to decide that the improvement caused them some damages, which was satisfied when the jury found the District 10 percent at fault. The appellate court rejected the farmers' assertion that any damage to property would be sufficient to justify compensation from the government. Based on the &quot;substantial interference&quot; instruction given to the jury, which was consistent with the proper legal standard for proving a claim based on inverse eminent domain, reasonable persons could have concluded that the farmers failed to meet their burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought re-election to the Arizona Senate. Defendant filed 29 nomination petitions with the Secretary of State. He personally verified 19 of the petitions as circulator. The theory underlying the indictment was that defendant falsely verified that signatures on the petitions were made in his presence. In a civil matter arising out of the allegations, an elector alleged defendant had committed petition forgery. The supreme court, however, concluded that the acts did not constitute petition forgery. In this matter, the indictment alleged that by falsely verifying that the nine petitions were signed in his presence pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-321(D) and filing them with the Secretary of State, defendant violated A.R.S. &sect; 39-161. Defendant argued the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court concluded an instrument that contained an untrue statement fell within Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-161 only if the instrument was counterfeit, inauthentic or otherwise not genuine. Even if defendant falsely verified the petitions, he did not violate the statute because his verifications did not render the petitions not genuine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Pima County, Arizona, that convicted her of conspiring to conceal or abandon a human body in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2926, arguing that the fetal remains at issue did not constitute a dead human body and that, absent any evidence of a live birth, her conviction could not stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant suffered a miscarriage and buried the fetus on her property. At trial, the trial judge instructed the jury that the &quot;baby&quot; was a dead human body. The jury returned a guilty verdict on the charge of conspiring to conceal or abandon a human body. On review, the court held that, while fetal remains were indisputably of human origin and not alive, it could not presume that the legislature intended to criminalize a woman's failure to report a miscarriage to the authorities in the very early stages of pregnancy. The Arizona legislature has not intended a fetus to constitute a &quot;person&quot; for all purposes, and when the legislature has intended to protect the unborn, it has done so by specific reference to a fetus. Because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-292 did not specify a gestational age of fetal development at which the statute was effective, unlike other statutes that expressly applied to fetuses, the court concluded that the statute did not apply to fetuses. As such, defendant could not be convicted of the crime charged for the disposal of fetal remains after her miscarriage.</SPAN></P>

The court's conclusion that defendant's non-refusal constituted agreement required reversal. When a warrantless search was supported by consent, the state had to establish that the suspect &quot;unequivocally,&quot; by his words or conduct, expressed consent to the search.

However, the State argued that defendant refused to attend in person and, as a result of defying the judge's orders, he forfeited his right to be present. The Court of Appeals of Arizona held that defendant's disruptive behavior at an earlier hearing was not a sufficient ground for excluding him from the disposition hearing. Therefore, the trial court sentenced him in violation of Rule 26.9 and his constitutional rights. However, defendant did not object at sentencing. He was not entitled to appellate relief because he could not show structural error. Defendant fully participated in the sentencing hearing through the use of audiovisual equipment.

The court stated that under the common law, utilities had been required to bear the entire cost of relocating from a public right-of-way whenever requested to do so by state or local authorities. There was nothing in the 1877 law that expressly or impliedly abrogated the common law. The 1877 law did not predate the common-law rule.

Defendant had been charged with theft of means of transportation, possession of burglary tools, misconduct involving weapons, and possession or use of dangerous drugs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers observed defendant drive and park a vehicle on a sidewalk in front of a house. After defendant exited the vehicle and began approaching the house, the officers came upon defendant. He consented to a search of his person, which revealed a loaded handgun, a jiggle key that defendant admitted that he used to start the vehicle, and methamphetamine. Defendant was subsequently indicted for multiple offenses, and he sought suppression. After a hearing, the trial court found that even if defendant had consented to a search, which defendant contested, such was not justified where there was no articulable suspicion of criminal activity. On appeal, the court disagreed with the grant of suppression. It held that consent was an exception under U.S. Const. amend. IV to the requirements of a warrant and probable cause. Accordingly, the trial court misapplied the proper standard in determining whether suppression was required. It should have made a determination as to whether defendant consented to the patdown search. Procedurally, it was appropriate to remand the matter for the trial court to make such a factual determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the matter for further proceedings, including a determination as to whether defendant gave consent to the patdown search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the order to defendant to move his truck was not a consensual stop, in balancing the governmental need for the stop against defendant's interest in remaining where he was, the stop was reasonable and lawful. Defendant asserted that the officer's command to move his truck was a seizure because police officers did not issue commands expecting to be ignored. The governmental interest at stake was the officer's safety while conducting a traffic stop of another person. It was unreasonable to require the officer to take the unnecessary risk of allowing defendant's truck to remain behind him. While the officer lacked reasonable suspicion that defendant he had committed any criminal activity prior to the stop, he was permitted to question defendant and his passenger because they were potential witnesses to the other person's erratic driving and possible intoxication. Once the officer lawfully contacted defendant and was suspicious that he might have been DUI, he was free to pass that information on to a second officer. The second officer's communications with defendant based on the shared information were pursuant to a reasonable belief that he had been involved in criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Pinal County, Ariz., Ord. 91097-PS, the Superior Court of Pinal County, Arizona, imposed at sentencing a &quot;prosecution fee&quot; of $ 1,000 on three defendants after they had been convicted of felonies in three separate cases. Defendants appealed, and the court consolidated the appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the county's prosecution fee was statutorily unauthorized and invalid. Although not clear cut, analysis of the pertinent factors supported a conclusion that the county's prosecution fee was effectively a penalty imposed against convicted felons after trial. As such, the assessment, and the ordinance under which it was imposed, did not clearly implicate the conduct of county business, as required for statutory authorization under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-251.05(A)(1). Further, because the ordinance and prosecution fee conflicted with the laws of Arizona, they were not authorized, either expressly or by necessary implication, under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-251.05(A)(1). Because the county's prosecution fee was statutorily unauthorized, it was illegal and fundamental error to include that assessment as part of defendants' sentences. The orders prejudiced defendants by requiring them to pay an unauthorized assessment, and they had to be relieved of that obligation, despite their failure to object below.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the orders imposing the fee as to each defendant, and, for the reasons set forth in a separate memorandum decision, affirmed defendants' convictions and probationary terms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners filed a civil rights action against defendant officers for false arrest, and alleged multiple torts and constitutional rights violations. The Superior Court in Yavapai County, Arizona, awarded plaintiff wife $ 10,000 in damages on the false arrest claim and the jury returned verdicts in favor of defendants on all remaining claims. Defendants appealed. Plaintiffs cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant officers arrived at plaintiffs' home at 6:30 a.m. to execute a search warrant. Hearing no response from inside the house, a detective breached the outer security door. Plaintiff husband believed that his family was under attack and fired a warning shot. Plaintiffs were both arrested. They filed a state court action against defendants for violation of state constitutional rights, excessive force, illegal arrest, and asserted tort claims. Plaintiffs also filed a complaint filed in federal court with almost identical allegations, including claims under the federal constitution. When defendants obtained a favorable judgment in the federal court, the state court erred by failing to apply the doctrine of claim preclusion in favor of defendants. Because the state court action arose out of the same nucleus of facts and all of the claims in could have been raised in the federal court action, the Court of Appeals of Arizona held that claim preclusion applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family of a deceased patient filed a medical malpractice suit against the doctors. The doctors filed a motion to enforce, requesting that the trial court require the patient's family to comply with Ariz. Rev.

The patient's family opposed the motion, arguing that the statute was unconstitutional because it infringed upon the rulemaking authority of the Arizona Supreme Court. The trial court denied the motion to enforce, and a special action followed. On review, the court upheld Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2603 and ruled that the statute did not conflict with Ariz. R. Civ. P. 16(c) and 26.2(b) but merely supplemented them. The statute required a preliminary expert opinion affidavit but did not require that the expert giving the preliminary affidavit serve as the expert at trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent sustained an injury at work. His employer's worker's compensation carrier retained the doctor to perform an IME to determine if the decedent's injuries were work-related and to recommend appropriate treatment. The decedent's treating physician prescribed narcotic pain medications, which the decedent abused until he overdosed and died. Relatives filed a wrongful death and medical malpractice suit against numerous physicians, including the doctor who performed the IME. On review of the judgment against the doctor, the court held that, while every physician hired to perform an IME does not have a duty of care in every situation, an IME physician hired to determine the extent of a patient's work-related injury and make treatment recommendations assumes a duty to conform to the legal standard of reasonable conduct in light of the apparent risk. Although a doctor-patient relationship did not exist, the doctor nevertheless had a duty to conform to proper standards of care.

On appeal of the trial court's order, the court held that the trial court's awarding the nonparent equal visitation rights was not reasonable and that it failed to accord significant weight to the mother's pre-petition voluntary agreement to allow the nonparent some visitation. Nothing in the record suggested that the trial court applied the presumption that the mother acted in the best interests of her child in determining the amount of visitation the nonparent should receive. The record also did not reflect sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption. There was also no indication that the trial court applied the factors found in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-409(C) (2007).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit alleging negligent highway design and wrongful death, plaintiff, the parent of a decedent killed in a single-vehicle accident, appealed a judgment of the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) in favor of defendant, the State of Arizona, based upon a determination that the State was entitled to qualified immunity under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-802.02(A)(7) (2003), arguing that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-802.02(A)(7) was a constitutional exercise of the legislature's authority and grant of qualified immunity under Ariz. Const. art. IV, pt. 2, &sect; 18. The immunity clause found in Ariz. Const. art. IV, pt. 2, &sect; 18, conferred upon the legislature a power to control actions against the State that it did not possess with regard to actions against or between private parties. Therefore, the legislature could specify instances when public entities and public employees would be entitled to immunity. The court rejected the parent's contention that upholding the validity of the statute would destroy the duty of reasonable care owed by government employees when designing and maintaining highways. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-820.02(A)(7) did not deny all injured drivers the right to sue the State for ordinary negligence but denied ordinary negligence claims against the State by drivers who were injured as a result of driving in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 28-693, -1381, or -1382. This limited immunity statute did not relieve governmental employees of the duty to use reasonable care in designing and maintaining highways.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, granted appellee resident relief on his complaint that the superior court order the City Clerk to perform his duties by calculating the required number of referendum petition signatures as 2,727. The superior court also awarded the resident attorney's fees and costs. Appellant city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that the issue on appeal was whether Phoenix, Ariz., City Charter (Charter), Ch. XVI, &sect; 3 conflicted with Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-142(A). If the statute controlled, the resident's petitions, each containing approximately 8,000 signatures, would be facially sufficient as to the number of signatures and the Clerk would be required to process them. The appellate court found that &sect; 19-142(A) was clear and unambiguous. The statute required the city to base the referendum signature requirement on the most recent mayoral or council election prior to the referendum petition application regardless whether it was a citywide or district election. Because the Charter limited the signature requirement to a calculation based solely on the most recent mayoral general election, it conflicted with &sect; 19-142(A) and therefore was invalid. The resident was entitled to attorney's fees and costs on appeal as Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2030 was applicable. The resident's claim presumed the Clerk would have processed the referendum petitions had the Charter been in compliance with state law. This was a mandamus-type action and &sect; 12-2030 applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that &sect; 43-1183 did not violate the Establishment Clause because: (1) it had a valid, secular purpose and was neutral towards religion, as it provided tax credits to corporations without reference to religion and provided benefits directly to a wide spectrum of individual scholarship recipients defined only by financial need and prior school attendance; (2) a program of true private choice was created because it permitted parents and students to exercise free choice among various secular and religious educational options; and (3) &sect; 43-1183 did not create excessive government entanglement with religion because the State's involvement was merely administerial in nature. Section 43-1183 did not improperly lay a tax in violation of Ariz. Const. art. 9, &sect; 10 because the individual tax credit limitations in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1089 provided an overall limit on the impact of the individual credits that was analogous to the precise limit provided in &sect; 43-1183(C), and the Arizona Supreme Court had affirmed the constitutionality of &sect; 43-1089. Section 43-1183 also did not violate Arizona's Enabling Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The airline appealed the judgment entered after a jury found it liable for compensatory and punitive damages stemming from its conduct surrounding the arrest and criminal prosecution of its passengers. The passengers, bounty hunters, were allowed to board a flight with their guns but were subsequently arrested and transported to jail. The appellate court rejected most of the airline's arguments, but reversed the judgment insofar as it awarded unconstitutionally excessive punitive damages. Because a Federal Aviation Administration letter was not introduced to prove that the airline acted in conformity with its actions in the 1998 incident, but to show notice, the letter fell within a Ariz. R. Evid. 404(b) exception. The jury could have found that the airline acted outrageously and with an evil mind by consciously pursuing a course of conduct designed to threaten the passengers with criminal convictions in order to secure a release of civil liability for the airline. The punitive damages were excessive because the airline's misconduct fell within the low to middle range of the reprehensibility scale. The ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages was 8:1 and was unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the judgment insofar as it awarded unconstitutionally excessive punitive damages and remanded for the entry of a reduced award of $ 500,000 for each passenger, for a total punitive damages award of $ 1 million. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer and counsel argued that the statutory licensing scheme for physicians and chiropractors prohibited lay persons from owning an outpatient treatment center. The appellate court noted that there was no statutory requirement that the individual owner of an outpatient treatment center be a licensed physician or health care provider or that the corporation identified be a professional corporation. The Director of the Department of Health Services (Director) did not deem it necessary to require that those owning an outpatient treatment center be licensed to practice in a health care related field, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-405(A). The appellate court noted that only licensed individuals who complied with the statutory licensing scheme under Ariz. Rev. Stat. tit. 32 could practice medicine. The center's license application revealed that although applicants were asked questions regarding management and the governing authority, they were not asked whether management or the governing authority was licensed to practice medicine. Moreover, nothing specifically prohibited a doctor from being employed by a layperson or general corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer argued that the owners lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the city's actions. The appellate court found that because the owners were taxpayers and business owners who were challenging a city act that expended monies for an allegedly unconstitutional purpose, they had standing. The appellate court noted that it was appropriate for Gift Clause, Ariz. Const. art. 9, &sect; 7, purposes to look at not only the purpose of the expenditure and what the public body received in return, but how the purpose was carried out. The owners argued that the agreement between the developer and the city did not serve a public purpose for Gift Clause purposes. The parking provisions of the agreement, other than the 200 spaces set aside for park and ride users, which were for a valid public purpose, unduly promoted private interests and violated the Gift Clause. Compliance with the Gift Clause could not be assumed because the indirect public benefits may be substantial. The funds went directly to the developer for private purposes. The Agreement did not satisfy the Gift Clause merely because there could not be such a loss. The owners were granted reasonable attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court pointed out that the trial court's order precluding the State's witness from testifying did not constitute an order granting a motion to suppress pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4032(6). The appellate court found prior caselaw to be controlling. The appellate court found the holding to be intact, and it represented the most cogent interpretation of &sect; 13-4032(6). The supreme court narrowly defined a &quot;motion to suppress&quot; and specified its jurisdictional implications. The narrow interpretation of a motion to suppress was supported by Ariz. R. Crim.

In affirming the trial court's decision, the court held that it did not need to reach the question of whether the statutory requirements trumped res ipsa loquitur because plaintiffs had failed to prove the elements of res ipsa loquitur. The court held that plaintiffs, who maintained that either the surgeon or the anesthesiologist controlled the instrumentality causing injury, failed to show that the surgeon had exclusive or shared control of the injury-causing instrumentality.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 20, para. 2 prohibited the recognition of polygamy or plural marriage by the State under all circumstances without exception, and therefore was both facially neutral and nondiscriminatory in effect. The trial court did not err by denying defendant the defense of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1407(D) because defendant and the victim could not have been considered spouses in a valid marriage under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-102(C), as polygamous marriages were void pursuant to Ariz.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3405(A)(1) (2001), and possession of drug paraphernalia, in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3415. He was placed on probation for 18 months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. Before trial, he moved to dismiss the charges on the ground that the use of marijuana was part of the practice of his religion. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant was convicted as charged. On appeal, the court held that the Arizona marijuana laws were of general applicability. Neither the language nor the circumstances surrounding the enactment of &sect;&sect; 13-3405(A)(1) and 13-3415(A) indicated that a purpose of the statutes was to infringe upon or otherwise restrict religious practices. Accordingly, the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution did not afford defendant an exemption from the laws, even if they had the incidental effect of burdening his religious practices. Further, the State had a compelling interest in banning the possession of marijuana. A uniform ban was the least restrictive means under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-1493.01(C), and indeed the only means, of achieving the government's compelling interest. An accommodation of defendant's unlimited use of marijuana would severely hinder the State's ability to enforce the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant title insurance company (defendant) sought review of the decision of the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona), which found in favor of plaintiff title agency (plaintiff) and refused to grant judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) to defendant on a claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty; plaintiff appealed the setting aside of a punitive damages award. The claim arose out of the recruitment of defendant employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue on appeal was whether the superior court erred in refusing to grant JMOL to defendant on a claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty brought by plaintiff and whether the superior court erred in setting aside a $ 35 million punitive damages award against defendant. Plaintiff's claim arose out of defendant's recruitment of an employee. The appellate court concluded that sufficient evidence supported the jury's verdict and an award of punitive damages, but held that the punitive damages award was unconstitutionally excessive and ordered that it be reduced. Sufficient evidence supported a conclusion that the employee breached her fiduciary duty by improperly soliciting plaintiff's employees while she was still employed by plaintiff and that defendant aided and abetted the breach, causing damage to plaintiff. Sufficient evidence also supported the jury's award of punitive damages against defendant even though the jury did not find that the employee and defendant acted in concert under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2506(F)(1) (2003). The harm in the case was the result of intentional malice and was not accidental.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the denial of the JMOL and vacated the portion of the order setting aside the punitive damages award assessed against defendant, but the appellate court reduced the amount of punitive damages awarded against defendant to $ 6,100,290. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At one time, a man owned a home with a pond and a water company. The man installed a pipe from his water company's line to supplement the pond. Both the water company and the home were subsequently sold and resold. When the water company, under its current ownership, discovered the pipe, it stopped the flow of water to the pond and filed suit against the current property owners for conversion and utility tampering. Following a jury trial, judgment was rendered in favor of the water company. On review, the court held that the superior court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the comparative fault of nonparties. Under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2506(A), comparative fault applied to actions involving property damage, which included economic loss proximately caused by a breach of duty. Because water that had been transformed into personal property was tangible property was tangible property, the comparative fault statute applied. Because the jury could apportion fault among the property owners as defendants and between nonparties, the jury should have received instructions regarding the alleged fault of the property owner's predecessors in interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated wrongful death cases, plaintiffs, the families of two decedents, appealed judgments of the Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, dismissing their claims against defendants, the State of Arizona and the Arizona Department of Corrections (DOC), arguing that the superior court erred in ruling that their claim letters submitted under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-821.01 (2003) failed to comply with the statutory requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The families of two decedents filed wrongful death suits after each respective decedent succumbed due to the failure to receive adequate medical care while in prison. In both cases, the State and the DOC moved to dismiss. The superior court granted the motions, ruling that the pre-suit notice of claims failed to set forth sufficient facts supporting the settlement demand. On review, the court noted that a claim was required to contain a specific amount for which the claim could be settled and facts supporting that amount. For purposes of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-821.01 (2003), it was enough for the State to understand that the first claimant was a surviving adult child seeking compensation for the death of her father. Similarly, the second claim letter provided at least two facts supporting the damages claim in noting that the decedent died prematurely and was survived by her mother and children. While it might have been preferable for the claims to provide detail concerning the quality of those relationships, the literal language of the statute did not require it. Therefore, any facts in support of the claim amount constituted the minimal compliance necessary to satisfy the statute.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 13-2319(A) and (D)(2) (Supp. 2008), arguing that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion for acquittal for failure to satisfy the corpus delicti rule and that the offense was not cognizable under Arizona law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was hiding under a piece of carpet in the bed of a truck that fled law enforcement officers at speeds exceeding 100 m.p.h., the occupants of the truck fled into a nearby cornfield when the truck was stopped, defendant appeared tired and his clothes were soiled consistent with having been smuggled into the country, and documents certified by a federal agency confirmed that defendant was not in the country legally.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the order of the Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, granting the motion of defendant wire service to quash a portion of a seizure warrant authorizing the State to seize for forfeiture all monies subject to defendant's person-to-person wire-transfers sent from twenty-eight states during a designated ten-day period. The State also appealed entry of a preliminary injunction regarding the warrant and forfeiture of funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Arizona was engaged in ongoing efforts to stop human-smuggling and narcotics trafficking across Arizona's shared border with Sonora, Mexico. The superior court granted the State a warrant to seize for forfeiture monies subject to defendant's wire-transfers of $ 500 or more sent from twenty-eight states, which did not include Arizona, to recipients in Sonora during a ten-day period. The superior court erred by granting defendant's motion to quash a portion of the warrant. The Court of Appeals of Arizona held that the electronic credits (ECs) targeted by the seizure warrant constituted intangible property subject to seizure and forfeiture. The superior court possessed in rem jurisdiction over the ECs, and therefore had jurisdiction to issue the warrant. The State sufficiently demonstrated probable cause to support issuance of the warrant. The warrant did not violate the Fourth Amendment's particularity requirement or the Commerce Clause. The State of Arizona did not invade the sovereign authority of other states by issuing the warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient filed a complaint against the physician, alleging that he committed malpractice when he administered a spinal epidural to her. The patient disclosed an expert witness. The physician moved to preclude the expert's testimony because he did not meet the requirements of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2604(A) (Supp. 2007). The trial court granted the motion. When the patient failed to disclose a new expert witness, the trial court granted the physician's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 12-2604(A) was unconstitutional as an infringement on the exclusive rule-making authority of the Arizona Supreme Court because the statute could not be harmonized with Ariz. R. Evid. 702. Rule 702 authorized expert testimony on the basis of knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education. In contrast, &sect; 12-2604(A) precluded a witness who was otherwise qualified under Rule 702 from testifying in a medical malpractice case unless he or she met the additional criteria set forth in the statute. Thus, a witness qualified under Rule 702 could nevertheless be excluded by the statute's strict practice or teaching requirements. The statute was therefore in direct conflict with Rule 702.</SPAN></P>

The 2006 amendment was purely procedural and applicable to actions filed before its effective date. An appeal was a proceeding and a step in the course of an action. A party raising a constitutional challenge in an appeal had to comply with the requirements of &sect; 12-1841 if it had not previously done so. The service requirements in the third sentence of subsection A were not limited to proceedings in which only declaratory relief was sought. The disclosure requirements in Ariz. R. Civ.

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 15-891, 15-891.04, 15-817.02, and 15-817.04 (2006).</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the Superintendent's motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the school voucher programs did not violate the Arizona Constitution. On appeal, the court found that the statutes at issue were facially neutral and favored neither one religion over another nor religion over non-religion. Parents and children could make an independent, personal choice to direct the funds to a particular school, which could be either religious or secular. The court concurred with the trial court's finding that the school voucher programs did not result in an appropriation of public money for, or an application of public money to, any religious worship, exercise, or instruction or to the support of any religious establishment in violation of Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 12. However, the school voucher programs provided aid to private schools in violation of Ariz. Const. art. IX, &sect; 10. The fact that public schools were included with private schools under the scholarship program did not change the court's conclusion.</SPAN></P>

The putative father's consent to the adoption was unnecessary because (1) under Ariz. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant associate attorney sued appellee law firm, asserting claims for breach of contract, unpaid wages, and promissory estoppel arising from an unpaid bonus. The Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) granted the firm's motion to dismiss the complaint, finding that the associate had failed to file his claims within the Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-541(3). The associate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court properly interpreted the oral agreement to provide the bonus as an employment contract under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-541(3) as the express language of &sect; 12-541(3) applying its terms to oral employment contracts, a species of employment contract not addressed in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1501, demonstrated that the legislature intended the scope of the former statute to extend beyond the concerns addressed in the latter. Applying the limitation period set forth in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-541(3) to employment contracts did not produce an illogical result. Moreover, the associate's cause of action did not support his contention that the agreement was unrelated to either the nature, conditions, or duration of his continued employment. Section 12-541(3) also applied to the claims for unpaid wages where an award of treble damages under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-355 was discretionary with the trial court and as a result, the court could have found that the firm had violated the statute but awarded only the associate's actual damages, i.e., the amount of unpaid wages.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1381(A)(1) (2004), driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DUI), and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1382(A) (2004), driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.15 or more (extreme DUI). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the mandatory assessment of $1000 imposed upon him pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1382(D)(6) and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-1651 (2004). The appellate court noted that defendant was a member of the class of extreme DUI offenders. The law treated all of the members of this class alike with regard to the imposition of the prison assessment whether their DUI offenses were misdemeanors or felonies. There was a rational relationship between the offense and the State's legitimate goal of defraying costs associated with the State's criminal justice system. Even if the assessment was &quot;unusual&quot; or &quot;rare,&quot; as defendant asserted, this was not a sufficient condition to render it unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The prison assessment was not excessive within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment or Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 15.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1204(A)(1) (2001). The trial court determined that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-673 (2001) did not authorize the use of blood evidence in a criminal prosecution when that evidence was taken from a defendant driver without a warrant in the absence of probable cause that the driver was under the influence. The court agreed and affirmed the judgment granting defendant's motion to suppress. The State stipulated that there was no probable cause to believe that defendant was under the influence. Defendant's blood evidence could not be introduced under the special needs exception to the Fourth Amendment because the exception did not apply when the purpose of the statute was the need for law enforcement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Pima County, Arizona, terminated appellant father's parental rights to his five-year-old daughter, and four-year-old daughter. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that Ariz. R. P. Juv. Ct. 66(D)(2) simultaneously provided that a failure to appear constituted an admission to the motion's allegations and yet required the court to consider the record and evidence presented to determine whether appellee Arizona Department of Economic Security had proven termination. The appellate court noted that in promulgating Rule 66(D)(2), the supreme court did not intend to deprive parents who failed to appear at a termination proceeding of their right to assistance of counsel at that hearing. Because the record demonstrated that the father's counsel did not seek to examine the Child Protective Services case manager to contest the factual assertions in the motion but rather to emphasize other evidence suggesting that the factual allegations were insufficient to prove termination, the court erred in precluding that examination. However, the error was harmless as the court properly considered all of the information the father's counsel sought to present when seeking leave to examine the case manager. Although the sheriff's incident report was improperly admitted, the trial court would not have ruled any different if it had not been admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners sued defendant county, challenging a county board of supervisors decision that a fence was constructed without a permit and maintained without a valid zoning permit and seeking a declaratory judgment to quiet title, claiming that had acquired ownership of the disputed property. The Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) granted the county summary judgment. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court implicitly ruled that the owners did not adversely possess the disputed property because the public had accepted it from the predecessors-in-interest. The recordation of the predecessors' deed and the subsequent conveyances excluding a right of way created by the deed were insufficient to constitute acceptance as nothing in the deed of the subsequently sold lots referred to the deed of dedication. Although acceptance could be established by use, disputes of fact remained as to whether the property covered by the predecessors' deed of dedication had actually been used in such a way as to constitute acceptance by the general public. Thus, summary judgment was improper as to whether the owners had acquired ownership of the disputed property. The superior court did not err in rejecting the claim that the county was equitably estopped from enforcing its zoning ordinance where the county was unaware of the fence's true location in relation to the predecessors-in-interest's property line and the alleged right-of-way. Moreover, the plot plan submitted with a permit application was deceptive and flawed, and a county employee's statements lacked the necessary formality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment was affirmed as to the equitable estoppel defense, but was otherwise reversed. The case was remanded for further proceedings. The owners' attorney fee request was denied as the ownership question had yet to be resolved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner challenged a decision from the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona), which awarded it compensation for a parcel of real property that was condemned by appellee city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner contended that there was a substantial delay between the city's initiation of the condemnation action and the date on which the property was actually taken, during which time the value of the property substantially increased. Therefore, the owner argued that the trial court's monetary award did not amount to just compensation under U.S. Const. amend. V and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17. In vacating, the court of appeals noted that Arizona law valued the property in a direct condemnation act as of the date of the summons initiating the condemnation act, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1123(A) (2003). The appellate court was unable to conclude that a taking had occurred on the statutory valuation date. Under the circumstances of this case, the trial court should have determined the date on which the city took the property and, if that date was different than the date on the summons, whether the value of the property on that date was the same as its value on the date of the summons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings. The trial court was instructed to determine both the date of the taking and the value of the property as of that date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of bigamy, in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3606(A). The Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) ordered defendant to pay restitution to the two women he had married. Defendant challenged the judgment of conviction and restitution award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction as the State was not required to prove that a marriage license was recorded, as required by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-125, to demonstrate that a person had knowingly married in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3606(A). Moreover, defendant did not dispute that he was married to one woman at the time he participated in a marriage ceremony with another woman and that his marriage to the first woman was valid. The restitution award was appropriate where both wives testified that they had not consented to defendant's other marriage, and as a result, both women were victims of the unlawful marriage for purposes of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-603(C). The restitution amount was proper where the documentation showed that one woman had lost wages and incurred travel related to the trial, while the other had incurred expenses in obtaining an annulment. However, the restitution award was vacated because it was entered after an ex parte proceeding in violation of defendant's due process and assistance of counsel rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed. The contention that the two women were not entitled to restitution was rejected, but the restitution award was vacated due to the violation of defendant's due process and assistance of counsel rights. The matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

She had created a potential harm by prescribing medications to individuals without physically examining them to ensure that they did not have more serious medical conditions. The due process challenges to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1401(27)(q) and (ss) were rejected where other physicians had been disciplined by the Board for activity similar to her practices and those physicians were held to the same standard of care required of all physicians.

However, the appellate court held that: (1) a felony that was set aside under &sect; 13-907 could still be used for the specific purposes set forth in the statute, including the subsequent prosecution of the defendant; (2) &sect; 13-907 was not unconstitutionally vague because it did not criminalize or punish any conduct; (3) there was nothing in the language of &sect; 13-907 that indicated any intent by the legislature to limit the types of convictions that could be used in subsequent prosecutions; (4) &sect; 13-907 was specifically intended to apply in circumstances such as those at hand; and (5) although the offense of resisting arrest had been designating a misdemeanor subsequent to his sentencing, the trial court was correct in treating it as a felony pursuant to Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient pleaded guilty but insane to attempted sexual conduct with a minor and was committed to the Arizona State Hospital. When he was near the end of his commitment, appellee State filed a petition alleging the patient was a sexually violent person (SVP). The Superior Court of Pima County, Arizona, found the patient to be a SVP and committed him to the Arizona Community Protection and Treatment Center. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the patient contended the trial court committed reversible error by admitting evidence of unproven prior acts in violation of Ariz. R. Evid. 404(c). The appellate court disagreed, finding that the trial court correctly concluded that Rule 404(c) did not apply to this prior-act evidence because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-3704(B) expressly permitted the introduction of prior-act evidence under the rules of evidence. As the State had to prove that the patient had been convicted or found guilty but insane of a predicate offense and that he suffered from a mental disorder that made it likely he would engage in future acts of sexual violence, the prior acts discussed in the doctor's testimony were relevant to the issues of the patient's mental disorder and his likelihood of committing future acts of sexual violence. They were thus directly relevant to the ultimate issue. And, because the prior acts were not used to prove the patient's conduct on a particular occasion, Ariz. R. Evid. 404(a), (b) did not affect their admissibility. The record sufficiently demonstrated that the necessary factors were argued, considered, and balanced by the trial court as part of its ruling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from the finding that she was delinquent based on her possession of a pipe that she used or intended to use to smoke marijuana. Because the juvenile court erred when it admitted the pipe into evidence, the appellate court vacated the finding under the Fourth Amendment and remanded to the juvenile court. The objection to the introduction of the marijuana pipe was sufficiently preserved for appeal under Ariz. R. Evid. 103. Additionally, once the officer secured appellant's purse, he deprived her of access to anything that it might have contained. Nor was there any evidence indicating that the seizure had not effectively foreclosed the possibility of appellant using anything in her purse to harm herself or others. Thus, there was no objective basis on which to justify the additional search of the purse once the officer had seized it. Unlike any emergency aid case involving the search of a purse, appellant was not unresponsive, not unaccompanied, not in obvious need of immediate medical attention, and both appellant and her mother were present and able to provide needed medical information in the event it had been necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff private citizens filed an action against defendant political action committee (PAC), alleging that the PAC's advertisements for seven ballot propositions in a special bond election did not comply with the requirements of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-912.01. The Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) granted summary judgment to the citizens and awarded them $1.3 million in mandatory statutory penalties. The PAC appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens claimed that the PAC violated Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-912.01 by failing to accurately identify its four major funding sources on advertisements in support of the seven propositions. However, the appellate court agreed with the PAC that the seven bond propositions did not deal with the same subject and thus the disclosure provisions did not apply. In the context of &sect; 16-912.01, under which the disclosure requirements applied only to advertisements the contents of which were more than fifty per cent devoted to one or more ballot propositions on the same subject, &quot;same&quot; meant &quot;identical.&quot; The bond propositions at issue were not identical in their subject matter because some dealt with funding for police and fire departments while others dealt with housing, education, streets, and parks and recreation. They were facially similar only on the highest plane of generality, in that they dealt with bonds. The propositions could not legally have been presented as one because they were not sufficiently related. Identification of supporters of all of the propositions, such as the PAC, would not serve to identify the implications of voting on any one of the propositions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated the trial court's judgment and directed the trial court on remand to enter summary judgment for the PAC.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The factors listed in the United States Postal Service's drug-package profile were a useful, non-exclusive catalog of elements to consider in determining the existence of probable case for forfeiture of property allegedly linked to illegal drug trade under Ariz.

Although no one specific factor any number of specific factors automatically established probable cause for forfeiture, when considered in the totality of the circumstances, the presence of any of the listed drug-package profile factors could contribute to a probable cause finding. In this case, the totality of the circumstances established probable cause for forfeiture. Specifically, the currency was shipped from out-of-state, and the package had been soaked in rubbing alcohol, wrapped in a plastic bag, sealed with duct tape, and placed inside a box packed inside another box. Moreover, the package label contained fictitious addresses for the sender and recipient, a fictitious phone number for the sender. Finally, and a certified narcotics dog had alerted on the package, indicating that the contents of the package were exposed to drugs in some fashion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) dismissed the class one misdemeanor charges filed against defendants, the operators of two sexually-oriented businesses, for selling adult magazines in the early morning hours in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1422(A) (2001). The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1422(A) (2001) prohibited purveyors of sexually-explicit materials from opening between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. on Monday through Saturday and between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon on Sunday. That restriction did not constitute a complete ban on purveyors of sexually-explicit material. The face of the statute, as well as its legislative history, showed that the legislature was concerned about the unsavory activities that occurred inside and outside the businesses, particularly during nighttime hours, rather than the speech itself. A purpose of the statute was to combat the secondary effects of the adult-oriented speech, and not the content of the speech itself, and thus was subject to intermediate, and not strict scrutiny. The pre-enactment record, although thin, supported the legislation's rationale that closing the sexually-oriented businesses in the late night/early morning hours would reduce the targeted secondary effects. Thus, the hours of operation restrictions set by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1422 (Supp. 2006) comported with Ariz. Const. II, &sect; 6 and could be constitutionally imposed against the adult businesses.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 4-251(A)(2) (2006). The arrestee was also charged with two counts of possessing forged instruments with intent to defraud, which was a class 4 felony pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2002(A)(2). The arrestee filed a special action challenging Proposition 100, a recent amendment to the bail provisions of Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 22(A).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestee was released on his own recognizance after an initial appearance.

The trial court concluded that the arrestee was not eligible for bail. In the special action, two issues were presented: (1) whether Proposition 100 applied to those persons who have entered or remained in the United States illegally but are now lawful residents; and (2) whether Proposition 100 was facially unconstitutional under either the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution. The appellate court concluded that Proposition 100 applied only to illegal aliens who currently remained illegally within the United States. The appellate court further concluded that Proposition 100 comported with the constitutional standards of equal protection and substantive due process. The appellate court rejected the argument that &quot;entered or remained in the United States illegally&quot; included those who once entered or remained within the United States illegally but now enjoy lawful residency status or citizenship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Pima County, Arizona, granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, county and various officials, on appellants', developer and title company, suit claiming that the county's 2005 ordinance amending Pima County, Ariz., Code &sect; 13.20.045, violated state law and unconstitutionally impaired the contractual relationship established in the 1998 agreement. The developer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer argued that the trial court erred by concluding Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;11-821 did not require sewer connection fees imposed on developers to bear a reasonable relationship to the burden imposed on the county. The appellate court found that &sect; 11-821 applied to the sewer fees. Although the county had long assessed sewer connection fees, it properly adopted them as a funding mechanism, making them subject to the requirements of &sect; 11-821(D)(4). The statute's language supported the developer's position that any mechanism adopted under the statute had to reasonably relate to the burden imposed by the particular development. The developer presented sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning the sewer connection fees. Reasonable people could find that revenue from sewer connection fees had been substantially more than necessary to offset development costs and had been used to subsidize user costs. Under the 1998 agreement, the developer could not have reasonably expected a particular discount nor that the county would use the fee revenue in a particular way. The 2005 ordinance did not substantially impair the developer's rights under the contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of summary judgment on the developer's claims for declaratory and monetary relief under the 2005 ordinance based on the reasonable relationship requirement in Ariz. Rev. Stat &sect; 11-821(D)(4)(b) was reversed; the grant of summary judgment was affirmed in favor of the county on the developer's impairment of contract claim. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, individuals and organizations, sued defendants, the Governor, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of State, alleging, inter alia, that the Attorney General had too narrowly interpreted the scope of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46-140.02 (2005) of Proposition 200. The Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) dismissed the complaint and denied plaintiffs' motion for leave to file an amended complaint. Plaintiffs challenged the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mandamus action against the Attorney General was properly dismissed as the abuse of discretion principle did not apply to the Attorney General's legal function, the opinion was not so deficient that it resulted in a complete failure to comply with the obligation to issue an opinion, and the Attorney General was under no obligation to withdraw the opinion. Moreover, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-446 did not prevent plaintiffs from obtaining a judicial determination concerning the proposition's applicability, and the Attorney General could not compel other state entities to make rules or regulations with respect to the proposition. The mandamus action against the Governor was properly dismissed as mandamus was not an appropriate method to obtain a definition of duties or to compel the Governor to edit her executive order. However, the declaratory judgment action against the Governor was improperly dismissed where her constitutional obligation gave her the ability to control the implementation of the proposition and the alleged facts established a real dispute as to the proposition's applicability. The trial court also erred in holding that amendment of the complaint was futile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was affirmed as to the dismissal of the mandamus claims, but was reversed as to the dismissal of the declaratory judgment action against the Governor and the denial of plaintiffs' motion for leave to file an amended complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the Phoenix, Ariz., Municipal Court of a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence (DUI), Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1381(A)(2). Prior to defendant's second trial, the municipal court denied the State's request for a jury trial. The superior court declined jurisdiction. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the municipal court erred by refusing to conduct a jury trial because the State had an independent right to a jury trial pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1381(F), and, alternatively, the State was required to consent to a defendant's waiver of a jury trial pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3883 (2001) and Ariz. R. Crim. P. 18.1(b), and the State did not do so. The appellate court noted that a plain reading of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1381(F) compelled the conclusion that only the defendant was entitled to a jury trial and only if the defendant asked for it. If no request was made by the defendant, the case would not be tried before a jury. Section 28-1381(F) did not grant the State a right to a jury trial in misdemeanor DUI cases. The only way to harmonize &sect;&nbsp;28-1381(F) with Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3983 and Ariz. R. Crim. P. 18.1(b) was to conclude that the latter provisions required consent to a defendant's waiver of a jury-trial right only when that right was also substantively granted to the State by the state or federal constitutions or by statute. Pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;28-1381(F), only a defendant had jury-trial rights in misdemeanor DUI cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for resisting arrest by physical force when she interfered in the arrest of another. Because the officer involved suspected that defendant was carrying contraband, a female officer was asked to search defendant. A strip search was performed, and a plastic bag was observed protruding from defendant's anus. Defendant refused to remove the item, so the female officer removed it. Defendant's motion to suppress the drugs found from this search was granted, and the State sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that a governmental search within a crime suspect's body profoundly implicated the interests in human dignity and privacy that the Fourth Amendment protected. For that reason, such searches generally required a warrant. Although the plastic bag protruding from defendant's anus was in plain view, when the female officer manipulated the item extending into defendant's rectum in search of evidence, she intruded on those very dignity and privacy interests. Since the State failed to either secure a warrant or establish any valid exception to the warrant requirement for that search,  the trial court did not err in suppressing its fruits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, granted judgment in favor of appellee city on appellant wife's medical malpractice and wrongful death suit. The wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife argued that the immunity clause of Ariz. Const. art. IV, part. 2, &sect; 18, did not apply to suits against a city. The appellate court did not infer that the legislature could not extend immunity to cities and city employees engaged in governmental functions. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-500.02 did not exceed the legislature's powers to adopt statutes governing the immunity of the state and its political subdivisions if the public entities and employees, in providing emergency medical services, were acting in a governmental capacity. Because the city would have been totally immune from suit at common law for ordinary negligence while acting in a governmental capacity, and it was acting in that capacity by providing emergency medical services to the decedent, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-500.02(A) did not violate the anti-abrogation clause. When no evidence showed intentional or bad faith destruction of evidence, a spoliation instruction was not mandatory. The trial court did not err in permitting the city to elicit testimony that its employees were trying their best when treating the decedent. The city's unapportioned lump-sum offer did not comply with Ariz. R. Civ. P. 68.</SPAN></P>
