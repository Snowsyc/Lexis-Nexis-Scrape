</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress the drug evidence and that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict. The court upheld the decision and concluded that the drug evidence was properly admitted and the jury verdict was supported by sufficient evidence. The district court determined that the victim's consent to the search was valid but did not specifically find that it was voluntary. Defendant argued that even if there was sufficient evidence presented at his hearing to support a finding that the victim consented to the search, the case needed to be remanded because the district court did not make a specific finding that her consent was voluntary. However, without any evidence to suggest a lack of understanding on the part of the district court, its finding that the victim's consent was valid encompassed the legal requirements that the victim's consent was freely and voluntarily given. Remand was therefore unnecessary. Additionally, the State showed that defendant had control of the cocaine and that he told police the drugs belonged to him. Thus, the evidence was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

The caregiver was disqualified from any position involving contact with or access to persons receiving services from facilities licensed by the State. In reviewing the commissioner's refusal to set aside her disqualification, the court looked to the factors set forth in Minn. Stat. &sect; 245C.22, subd. 4(b) (2010) to be considered in determining the merits of a request to set aside a disqualification. The court noted that for the eleven factors for which a risk assessment was made, the caregiver was given three &quot;lower risk&quot; evaluations, five &quot;medium risk&quot; evaluations, and three &quot;higher risk&quot; evaluations. Substantial evidence supported the determination that the caregiver failed to prove she did not pose a risk of harm. The determination that her disqualification would not be set aside was not outside the agency's jurisdiction, unconstitutional, procedurally defective, based on an erroneous legal theory, unsupported by substantial evidence, or arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant orchestrated a significant drug sale involving over forty pounds of marijuana with a value of at least $ 1,200 per pound. The court concluded that the $ 25,000 fine was not unduly harsh. The maximum fine for a third-degree controlled-substance conviction was $ 250,000 pursuant to &sect; 152.023, subd. 3(a). The fine imposed was less than thirty percent of the statutory fine maximum and less than the thirty percent minimum fine recommended by the legislature. The gravity-of-the-offense and harshness-of-the-penalty factors supported a determination that the fine imposed was not disproportional to the offense. In addition, the fine was not unconstitutionally excessive when compared with authorized fines for other level VI Minnesota crimes. In addition, defendant's fine was not grossly disproportionate when compared to fines imposed in other jurisdictions for the same offense. The range of fines for defendant's offense under the federal guidelines was $ 5,000 to $ 50,000. U.S. Sent. Guidelines Manual &sect; 2D1.1, 5E1.2(c)(3) (2008).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his convictions should be reversed because the State failed to present evidence that the offenses occurred in the county. The district court took judicial notice of the essential element of the offenses by instructing the jury that the city where the offenses occurred was in the county. The court upheld the decision. Although no witness testified that the offenses occurred in the county, there was ample evidence of that fact. Several witnesses testified that the offenses occurred in the city. As the city was located in the county, the court held that the judicial notice did not relieve the State of its burden. Defendant also asserted that his motion for new trial should have been granted, but the court disagreed. Undisclosed witness statements were favorable to defendant because they could have been used to impeach another witness that she had not consumed defendant on the day of the sexual assault and to corroborate the victim's testimony that the witness consumed drugs at defendant's home in exchange for sexual acts. However, the court held that there was not a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Pope County District Court (Minnesota), which convicted him of second-degree assault and imposed the mandatory minimum sentence under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11, subd. 5(a) (2008), in the absence of a jury finding that he possessed a firearm at the time of the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. It was unclear whether defense counsel's failure to request a voluntary-intoxication instruction was tactical. On one hand, defense counsel's failure to request the instruction after asserting intoxication as a defense in opening and closing statements suggested that the failure may have been inadvertent. On the other hand, defense counsel argued other grounds for a finding of reasonable doubt as to intent, focusing in the end on stupidity. Thus, the court could not ascertain whether trial counsel's failure to request the instruction was tactical. Nor could the court properly consider whether defense counsel's performance was deficient. Thus, the issue could not be determined on its merits via direct appeal. As the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence under &sect; 609.11 was automatic upon the finding of a triggering factor, there was no reason to apply a rule that was adopted to ensure compliance with sentencing-guidelines requirements related to discretionary departures. Despite the failure to cite &sect; 609.11 at sentencing, defendant clearly understood the reason for the sentencing departure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to a drug possession charge. The court stayed adjudication and placed him on probation. He twice violated the  conditions and subsequently spent a short time in jail before being released again on probation. Thereafter, the trial court revoked his probation based on his use of amphetamines and his failure to inform his probation officer of prescribed pain medication he said he was taking. On appeal, he challenged the first basis as a violation of his right to confront witnesses under the Confrontation Clause. The appellate court cited authority that stated that the Confrontation Clause did not apply in probation revocation hearings. However, it also found that it did not necessarily have to decide the case on that ground because his probation officer plainly provided a nontestimonial-hearsay statement that, after she confronted him about his testing positive for amphetamines, on two occasions he attempted to explain the source of the amphetamines, which meant he did not deny the first basis. It then found that the two reasons cited for the revocation provided the trial court with clear and convincing evidence that grounds existed to revoke his probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11, subd. 5(a) (2008), defendant could be subjected to an enhanced sentence if he had a firearm in his possession at the time of the offense. The enhancement provision did not define the term &quot;firearm,&quot; but the district court concluded that for purposes of &sect; 609.11, a BB gun qualified as a firearm. The court upheld the decision on the basis that the definition of &quot;firearm&quot; was to be broadly interpreted and included BB guns. Defendant further argued that the imposition of an enhanced sentence based on the district court's factual finding violated his constitutional right to a jury trial. The argument was solely directed at the legal issue of whether the BB gun qualified as a firearm under &sect; 609.11. The district court concluded that it did, and the construction of a criminal statute was a legal question. The court found that the question of whether a BB gun qualified as a firearm in a criminal statute had properly been treated as a question of statutory interpretation in several cases. Accordingly, the district court properly applied Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11 to enhance defendant's sentence based on its legal conclusion and not a finding of fact.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 634.20 (2008), permitting the admission of similar-domestic-abuse evidence, served the intended function of providing a context within which the trial court could evaluate the credibility of defendant and the victim, who had lived with him for about 10 years. Because the victim had not reported earlier incidents to law enforcement and the offenses occurred within the privacy of the home, no one else was able to provide eyewitness testimony regarding the events that transpired. The victim testified that defendant threatened to kill her, but defendant testified that he did not threaten to kill her, but said that he was not going to kill himself by working hard. Given the clash in accounts of what happened, the trial court's credibility determinations were critical to the outcome of the case. The trial court found that the testimony of the victim, her 16-year-old son, and her 12-year-old daughter about prior incidents of domestic abuse to be credible, persuasive, and consistent. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting that evidence as the probative value of the proffered &sect; 634.20 evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of police investigating a report of a drug sale, defendant was charged with, inter alia, second-degree possession of a controlled substance in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.022, subds. 2(1), 3(b) (2002). He challenged the constitutionality of a pat-down search, which revealed marijuana, and a warrantless search of his vehicle, which uncovered cocaine. The trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence obtained. Following a jury trial, the jury found him guilty of that charge. He  petitioned for postconviction relief, stating that (1) he was subject to an illegal investigative pat-down search of his person; (2) the warrantless search of his vehicle was unlawful; and (3) he was denied a fair trial because of prosecutorial misconduct. The trial court denied that petition. On his appeal of the denial of that petition, the appellate court found that the investigative pat-down search of defendant was lawful and did not violate defendant's constitutional rights, the dog-sniff of defendant's vehicle was justified based on evidence suggesting he had been involved in a drug deal, and the State was not involved in prosecutorial misconduct regarding its closing argument.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Scott County District Court (Minnesota), which sentenced him to a prison term of 360 months for one count of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree, which was an aggravated departure from the presumptive guidelines sentence of 122 months under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1352 (1994 &amp; Supp. 1995), the patterned-sex-offender statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court violated his constitutional right against self-incrimination by ordering him to submit to an adverse psychosexual examination as a condition precedent to such court's receipt of testimony from defendant's expert at his trial on the patterned-sex-offender factors. Defendant also claimed that the evidence produced at trial was insufficient to establish that he was a patterned sex offender. The State argued that because the departure was not based on the evidence presented at trial, defendant's claims of error were not grounds for reversal. The court held that because the district court limited the upward durational departure to the 30-year sentence prescribed by statute, a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt on the patterned-sex-offender factors was unnecessary. Accordingly, any trial error resulting from the claimed constitutional violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and it was irrelevant whether the trial evidence sustained a finding that defendant was a patterned sex offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, defendant was acquitted of two counts of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct, but was convicted of two counts of furnishing alcohol to a minor and one count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. On appeal, he challenged the requirement that he register as a predatory offender pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166, subd. 1b(a)(1) (2006). He claimed that the conviction offenses did not &quot;arise out of the same set of circumstances&quot; as the criminal sexual conduct charges, that the predatory offender registration statute violated his substantive and procedural due process rights, and that the registration requirements violated his  rights under Apprendi and Blakely. The appellate court found that (1) he could be required to register as a sex offender because the conviction offenses arose out of the same set of circumstances as the criminal sexual conduct charges; (2) his fundamental rights were not implicated because the registration statute was a civil regulatory law and was not punitive in nature, and that law was rationally related to the state's interest in solving crimes; and (3) neither Apprendi nor Blakely, involving penalties, were violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police responded to a report of a dispute. As the officers approached the home, they heard very loud pounding noises that sounded like someone or something being thrown inside the home and also heard a woman screaming. The officers knocked several times before defendant responded. He denied that anything was amiss, but the officers placed him in handcuffs before going to aid the woman, who screams and cries could still be heard. Defendant admitted that they had gotten into an argument after they returned from a bar, and he was charged with driving while intoxicated. On review, the court held that the officers' warrantless entry into defendant's home was justified under the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement because the facts were sufficient to justify the officers' reasonable belief that the woman inside the house had been injured or was in danger and was in need of police and perhaps medical assistance. The circumstances were sufficient to give the officers reasonable grounds to believe that an emergency existed in the home that required their immediate assistance. Had the officers acted otherwise, they would have been derelict in their duty.</SPAN></P>

They soon obtained search warrants for a DNA sample and a search of a backpack he had been carrying. The trial court denied his motion to suppress.

The appellate court found that (1) the motion to suppress evidence allegedly seized illegally was properly denied based on the inevitable-discovery doctrine; (2) evidence that he had been in prison before was not significant in convicting him; (3) admission of evidence he had committed a prior crime was plain error, but did not affect his substantial rights; and (4) the evidence sufficiently showed his conduct caused the victim Minn.

Defendant was released, with the condition that he have no contact with the wife. Defendant was later arrested and charged with violating the DANCO. Defendant moved for dismissal of the DANCO-violation charge on the ground that a domestic-assault charge could not form the basis for a DANCO. The appellate court ruled that the district court had the authority to impose the DANCO as a condition of defendant's release under Minn. Stat. &sect; 629.72 (2008). Domestic assault fit within the statutory definition of domestic abuse. Also, it was constitutional to impose criminal sanctions for the violation of the condition of release. Minn. R. Crim. P. 6.02, subd. 1, as a whole did not violate the constitution. The Minnesota Legislature could create criminal penalties for violation of specific conditions of release. Once defendant agreed to a conditional release, Minn. R. Crim. P. 6.02 did not prevent criminal sanctions for violating those conditions.</SPAN></P>

While the Sixth Amendment gave an accused in all criminal prosecutions the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defense, the accused's Sixth Amendment right to counsel attached upon initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings, but sexually dangerous person (SDP) proceedings were facially civil; civil commitment proceedings, as well as any actions commenced by an individual as a challenge to his civil commitment, were not criminal proceedings to which the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attached. Further, Minnesota's law governing the commitment of sexually dangerous persons did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy because it focused on treatment and not punishment and because a committed person could be released once sufficiently rehabilitated and in control of his or her sexual impulses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer and seller entered into a contract for the purchase of several properties in Mexico. After the buyer partially performed, he discovered that the seller did not possess title to the properties.

When the buyer learned that the seller had no legal right to sell the property without having legal title, he contacted the titleholders and successfully had title transferred. He thereafter ceased payments to the seller of the outstanding amounts due under the contract, and the seller filed suit. On review of the district court judgment requirement the buyer to perform, the court held that, because the seller performed by delivering possession of the properties to the buyer and the buyer held title, the buyer was required to perform by paying the purchase price.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to a final hearing in their dissolution action, the mother and father, who were both represented by counsel, reached agreement on nearly all issues.

Each party stated during questioning that he or she had sufficient time to consult with counsel, understood the agreement, and accepted it. In particular, the father stated that he was of sound mind and was not affected by medication he had taken. The trial court eventually incorporated the agreement into a dissolution-of-marriage judgment. Thereafter, it denied his motion to vacate the judgment and reopen the dissolution action. The appellate court found that (1) the father was sufficiently competent during the action; (2) premature entry of the dissolution judgment under Minn. R. Gen. Prac. Dist. Ct. 307(b) was harmless error; (3) the record did not show his attorney was incompetent; and (4) the trial court did not commit reversible error in adopting verbatim the mother's proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order for dissolution judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the clinic's constitutional rights under the U.S. and Minnesota Constitutions were not violated by the grant of a tax exemption to the University of Minnesota. The exemption was rationally related to the purpose of the exemption: to support the state's interests in education and research. The University of Minnesota Veterinary Medical Center (UMVMC) was a teaching hospital, part of a public university. It was a governmental entity. Veterinary students were being taught how to treat cats. Research was being conducted at the UMVMC. The clinic was a for-profit business. The differences in the tax treatment between the UMVMC and the clinic were not arbitrary. Although the clinic appeared to argue that the UMVMC was not entitled to an exemption because it failed to give exemption certificates to the vendor, the clinic provided no evidence to support this claim.</SPAN></P>

The father's motion to strike from the attorney's brief the arguments addressing matters that she lacked standing to appeal was granted. The award of attorney fees against the attorney was reversed because Minn. Stat. &sect; 549.211 was not satisfied. Minn. Stat. &sect; 259.58 did not fail to give sufficient weight to the parents' decisions regarding the child. It did not improperly foist upon them an improper presumption favoring visitation or contact. The district court applied the exceptional circumstances standard of the statute. The district court did not err in awarding the father compensatory time beyond that originally required under the contact order because the parents limited the father's contact with the child. The appellate court remanded for findings on the Paulson factors regarding the fees awarded to the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for Fourth Amendment purposes when a deputy activated his lights because a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave. Although the deputy testified that he could not recall ever having seen a vehicle parked on 243rd street at four a.m., he did not articulate anything particularly suspicious about the area. Also, the district court did not find credible the deputy's testimony concerning the link between the van and an earlier burglary. Without that link, there was nothing about the particular location of defendant's van that suggested criminal activity. Also, the deputy was justified in approaching the van to perform a welfare check; however, when the van departed, any cause for concern for the occupant's welfare should have been alleviated. Instead, the deputy proceeded to perform a traffic stop. There was nothing repetitive or particularly unusual about defendant's conduct in driving away. Thus, the deputy's decision to stop defendant's van was not based on a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity. Because the stop violated defendant's constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizure, the evidence was properly suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Becker County District Court (Minnesota) that convicted him of a first-degree controlled substance crime, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress drug evidence found during a vehicle search because the vehicle search was unlawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While federal and state police were executing a search warrant, they noticed a truck being operated suspiciously by approaching the housing, slowing down, and then accelerating after the vehicle's occupants noticed police officers. The street was a dead-end street, and the police watched the truck back up all the way down the street and stop in front of the house being searched; they also noticed that defendant, who had formerly been driving, was now the passenger. They stopped the vehicle and impounded it because the vehicle was registered to neither occupant and neither could produce proof of insurance. During an inventory search, the police discovered drugs. On review, the court held that, because neither defendant nor the other occupant owned the car, could prove that they had the owner's consent to drive the vehicle, and could not produce proof of insurance, the police had a legitimate basis to impound the truck to safeguard it and its contents. Once the vehicle was in police custody, the police were authorized to conduct an inventory search.</SPAN></P>

The former husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former husband challenged the trial court's extension of an order for protection (OFP) against him, arguing that: (1) the trial court abused its discretion by granting the extension; (2) it abused its discretion by extending the OFP for 50 years; and (3) Minn. Stat. &sect; 518B.01, subd. 6a(b) (2008), which authorized an OFP extension of up to 50 years, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The appellate court found that to obtain the extension under the Minnesota Domestic Abuse Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 518B.01 (2008), the former wife only had to show one of four alternatives listed in Minn. Stat. &sect; 518B.01, subd. 6a(a) (2008), and was not required to demonstrate that physical harm was imminent. It then found that the former husband's admitted violations of the original OFP alone warranted the extension. However, it also found that the trial court did not set forth the reasons for granting the maximum statutory extension of 50 years, and, thus, further proceedings were needed. It also declined to rule on the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 518B.01, subd. 6a(b) (2008), authorizing up to the 50-year extension, as defendant raised that issue for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment extending the order for protection and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings regarding the proper duration of that extension.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) denied defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence of a urine test, which revealed an alcohol concentration of.15. Defendant was convicted of driving while intoxicated with an alcohol concentration of.08 or more within two hours of driving, in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 1(5) (2008).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant driving his pickup truck erratically. The officer stopped defendant. While speaking with him, the officer detected slurred speech, the smell of alcoholic beverages, and bloodshot and glassy eyes. After defendant failed several field-sobriety tests, the officer arrested him for driving while impaired (DWI). At the police station, the officer read defendant the implied consent advisory. The officer asked defendant if he would take a urine test, and defendant responded in the affirmative. The officer followed the standard implied consent advisory and informed defendant, after his DWI arrest, that it would be a crime to refuse a test. The officer did not inform defendant that it would be a crime to refuse the urine test. Thus, the advisory that the officer provided to defendant was not misleading under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 169A.20, subd. 2(2) and 169A.51, subd. 3. Furthermore, the warrantless search of defendant's urine was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment based on the existence of exigent circumstances as the alcohol inside defendant would begin to dissipate. Thus, it was unnecessary for the officer to obtain defendant's consent to the urine test.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The district court concluded that clear and convincing evidence showed the patient was highly likely to commit future acts of harmful sexual conduct under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c(a)(3). Two psychologists ultimately concluded that the patient met the statutory definition of an SDP. Although some evidence suggested that the patient's risk of reoffense was moderate, both experts highlighted the patient's lack of treatment and opined that, without appropriate treatment, the patient was highly likely to reoffend. While a line-by-line analysis of the Linehan factors showed that two factors were neutral or weighed against the patient's commitment the task of sorting out expert opinions and balancing the factors was left to the district court. The district court specifically credited the psychologists' findings, and the psychologists agreed that the patient's lack of treatment placed him at a greater risk of reoffense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of a decision entered by the Douglas County District Court (Minnesota), which ruled that the owner's claims of a regulatory taking under an airport zoning ordinance as adopted and as applied were barred by the six-year statute of limitations in Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.05, subd. 1 (2008) and that an equal protection claim was barred by collateral estoppel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance at issue had been adopted in 1977 to regulate and restrict the height of structures and the use of property in two safety zones. The owner had property in each of the two safety zones. An application to a county board of commissioners for a conditional use permit (CUP) in 1996 for approval of a temporary gravel-mining and crushing operation and a temporary hot-mix plant in the first safety zone was denied. Subsequently in 2005, the owner sought approval for a residential development plan; the request was denied in 2006. On appeal, the court affirmed. The as-applied takings claim for the property in the first zone accrued in 1996, rather than 2006, because the board had reached a final decision regarding the CUP; it made no difference that the CUP involved a temporary use. The facial takings challenge also was barred because the ordinance was not a continuing interference as no continuing affirmative acts were involved. An equal protection claim was barred by collateral estoppel as while a prior decision challenged the underlying land use decision and the instant action sought compensation, the issue was identical.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a landlord tenant dispute, appellant the Public Housing Agency of the City of Saint Paul (PHA) appealed the judgment of the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota) that denied its request for immediate possession of its property. Appellee tenant cross appealed the denial of his motion to suppress evidence that was obtained during an illegal search of his person and admitted against him at the eviction trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">PHA argued that the district court erred because the tenant's possession of marijuana constituted &quot;criminal activity&quot; and &quot;drug-related criminal activity&quot; as those terms were defined in the parties' lease agreement. The court of appeals disagreed because PHA did not prove the definitions of &quot;criminal activity&quot; and &quot;drug-related criminal activity&quot; that were allegedly set forth in the lease. The district court emphasized PHA's failure to offer the lease into evidence. The district court described the testimony regarding the policies as providing an &quot;incomplete definition&quot; that did not help establish that the tenant engaged in drug-related criminal activity. The district court's decision was based on a failure of proof. The definition of &quot;drug-related criminal activity&quot; contained in exhibit six was incomplete, referenced an &quot;unidentified list,&quot; and &quot;left the reader in the same position as without the incomplete definition.&quot; Instead of offering the lease for the district court's consideration, PHA offered an incomplete version of the relevant definitions and what was limited, vague, and confusing testimony regarding the definitions. The district court did not credit the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a bar fight, and he resisted slightly as a police sergeant led him to his squad car. The sergeant conducted a pat down search but discovered no contraband. When another officer appeared to interview defendant, the sergeant noticed two clear plastic bags containing a white substance on the ground near defendant's foot. The white substance was methamphetamine, and defendant was charged with several drug-related offenses. On review, the court held that the district court did not err in denying defendant's suppression motion because, while defendant's physical resistance did not mandate a conclusion that he was armed or dangerous, his unwillingness to cooperate with the sergeant provided support for the pat frisk. Further, defendant abandoned his drugs after the pat frisk, and the time that elapsed between the frisk and the abandonment constituted sufficient intervening circumstances to disconnect the pat frisk from the subsequent abandonment. Defendant's effort to dispose of the drugs was not prompted by the frisk but, rather, by his continued detention, and the sergeant did not exploit the frisk to obtain the drugs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota), which convicted him of second-degree controlled-substance crime. Defendant argued that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from his residence during a warranted search. He asserted that the search warrant application failed to provide a substantial basis to believe that drugs or evidence of drugs would be found at his residence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The affidavit supporting the warrant application stated, in part, that a detective had learned from a cooperating reliable individual (CRI) that the CRI had been present in defendant's residence within the last 72 hours and observed cocaine in the home. The warrant was executed eight days after it was issued. Defendant argued that the district court erred in not suppressing the evidence found during the search of his home because the information supporting probable cause for the warrant had become stale by the time the warrant was executed. The court agreed. The description of defendant, his address, the fact that he owned a car-washing business, and the CRI's observation of cocaine in defendant's home on one occasion more than a week before the warrant was executed did not provide reason to believe that defendant either possessed or sold drugs out of his home on a basis continuing to the time of the search, especially given the disposable nature of cocaine and lack of information in the affidavit about the quantity of cocaine observed. The state failed to rebut the argument that the information in the warrant application was stale by the time the warrant was executed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A City ordinance required taxicab-service companies to have certain percentages of fuel-efficient and wheelchair-accessible vehicles.

The appellate court ruled that Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances &sect; 341.300(b), requiring taxicab-service companies to have a certain percentage of their fleets wheelchair accessible and fuel efficient, did not violate the company's substantive-due-process rights under the United States or Minnesota Constitutions. Nothing showed why the service companies could not contract with and subsidize a certain number of vehicle owners to have fuel-efficient and wheelchair-accessible vehicles, and adjust the division of fares with the other owner/drivers to spread the cost of compliance over a vehicle fleet. The company produced no evidence showing that the fuel-efficiency requirement lacked a rational relationship to the environmental objective, and witnesses testified to long waits and inadequate service for customers dependent on wheelchairs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the county told the farmers that it needed to do a routine inspection of their farms and register any feedlots, the farmers claimed that the MPCA rules did not provide authority for the inspections. The county filed misdemeanor complaints against the farmers. The county later dismissed the complaints. The county pursued administrative search warrants. The farmers brought an action against respondents for abuse of process and malicious prosecution. The action was dismissed. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in awarding summary judgment to respondents. Respondents did not abuse process by filing petitions for inspection orders. The farmers could not show that respondents had an ulterior purpose. The farmers were unable to show injury because the misdemeanor charges were dropped approximately one month after they were filed. The farmers produced no evidence of malice. The trial court did not err in granting the judges' motion to dismiss under the judicial-immunity doctrine because the actions that the farmers asserted were improper were the issuance of orders and search warrants, clearly acts normally performed by a judge in his or her official capacity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the evidence should have been suppressed because the officer's stop of his vehicle was the product of unconstitutional police conduct on a prior occasion and the evidence seized during the traffic stop resulted from an improper extension of the investigation after reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity had dissipated. The court disagreed and upheld the conviction because all evidence was not &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police. An analysis of the facts showed that the link between the initial unconstitutional stop and the evidence obtained by the officer was too attenuated to warrant suppression and dismissal of the charges at issue. Given that there were intervening circumstances including a substantial amount of time between an earlier stop and the stop at issue, there was no evidence that the officer obtained the evidence of intoxication by exploiting the unrelated unconstitutional stop.

Stat. &sect; 256D.06, subd. 1b (2008), because he did not have a discharge plan or a separate savings account. Because appellant failed to identify any similarly situated MSOP residents who were being treated differently, he failed to demonstrate that application of Minn. Stat. &sect; 256D.06, subd. 1b violated his right to equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sex offenders challenged the denials of writs of habeas corpus by the Carlton County District Court (Minnesota), arguing that their commitments as a sexually dangerous person (SDP) and a sexually psychopathic personality (SPP) were punitive, that they did not receive adequate treatment, and that Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.185 (2008) violated their constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the sex offender's claim of punitive commitment failed because they did not allege that Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.185 caused them personal harm. Because the sex offenders offered nothing more than a baseless assertion, they failed to present a prima facie case for habeas relief. Further, the secure facility to which the sex offenders were confined could impose restrictions and conditions to control their behavior in order to protect the public and to treat them for the malady causing their inability to control their behavior. The court further rejected the contention of inadequate treatment because, in order to assert that the Minnesota Sex Offender Program has not provided adequate treatment, sex offenders were required show that they were actually deprived of treatment. Further, indeterminate commitment was not analogous to a life sentence and did not violate substantive due process. Even when treatment was problematic, as it often is, the State's interest in the safety of others was no less legitimate and compelling. So long as civil commitment was programmed to provide treatment and periodic review, due process was provided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners challenged an order of the Pennington County District Court (Minnesota) granting respondent public service corporations' motion for a quick-take condemnation of a pipeline easement over a portion of the owners' land. The owners argued, in part, that the district court erred in its finding of public necessity and that Minn. Stat. &sect; 117.189 (2008) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations applied to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) for a certificate of need authorizing the pipeline project. The PUC granted the corporations' applications for a certificate of need and routing permit for the pipeline. The owners did not seek appellate review of the PUC's final order under Minn. Stat. &sect; 14.63 (2008) and did not mount a district court challenge to the PUC order as a violation of the Minnesota Environmental Policy Act within the 30-day statute of limitations imposed by Minn. Stat. &sect; 116D.04, subd. 10 (2008). Because the district court order granting a quick-take condemnation and appointing commissioners was an intermediate order, the only issue which could be considered on appeal was whether the district court erred in determining that the requisite public necessity existed. Because the issue of public necessity was not raised in the owners' application for rehearing before the PUC, however, that issue was not subject to appellate review pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 216B.27, subd. 2 (2008). The court noted that even if it were to reach the merits of the public-necessity argument, the owners' claim would fail due to lack of evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city denied appellant developer's application to subdivide a parcel of land. The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, granted summary judgment to the city on the developer's takings, equal-protection, and other claims, and denied the developer's request to amend its complaint. The developer sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that the trial court did not err in finding that there was no regulatory taking under the Fifth Amendment. Contrary to the developer's claims, its 2006 application was in conflict with the regulatory scheme in place before 2006 amendments to the ordinance. Therefore, it was unclear what economic impact, if any, the amendments had on the lot's value, and the amendments to the ordinance did not interfere with the developer's reasonable investment-backed expectations. The developer also failed to offer sufficient evidence that it was disproportionately burdened by the amended ordinance. Thus, all three Penn Central factors weighed in favor of the city. The city did not violate the developer's right to equal protection. Three of the four subdivision applications that the developer compared itself to were made several years earlier than the application at issue and thus were not similarly situated. The fourth property was not similarly situated because the part of the property containing steep slopes was in a different city. Finally, the developer did not show any prejudice from the city council's allegedly erroneous rejection of proffered evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The property owners did not dispute that the comprehensive plan did not provide for roadway improvements near their property for several years. Conflict with the comprehensive plan provided the city with a rational basis to deny a development request. Because the property owners' proposed development required roadway improvements, the city's decision was supported by a rational basis and is reasonable. The city had at least four valid, rational reasons for denying the property owner's concept plan. Their proposed development did not comply with the city's comprehensive plan. It did not comply with the city's zoning ordinances. It was not serviced by utilities or adequate roadways, and the city had more than 400 acres of other land ready for development. The city's decision to deny approval of appellants' concept plan was reasonable, and the district court did not err by granting summary judgment to the city.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, petitioner did not waive any omnibus issues until the plea hearing, and counsel stated that petitioner was aware of the option to pursue a contested omnibus hearing. Given that the suppression motion had been denied twice in the companion case and petitioner had admitted to possession of the gun and drugs, counsel testified that she &quot;felt the most appropriate strategy was to seek a favorable plea offer.&quot; Counsel's failure to inform petitioner of a specific trial procedure as a way to preserve an issue for appeal did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

He pled guilty to the latter two charges, and the former two were dismissed. Nevertheless, the DOC, relying upon the offender's history of anger, aggression, and sexually explicit behavior, assigned a Risk Level II to relator and required him to register as a predatory sex offender. The offender contested the classification, arguing that he should not have to register as a predatory offender because he was not convicted of a sexual offense. On review, the court held that, because the offender pled guilty to the theft, which arose from the same set of circumstances as a predatory sex offense, he was thus required to register as a predatory offender under Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166, subd. 1b(1)(iii) (2008), and his conviction triggered the process to assess his risk level under Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.052, subd. 3(d)(i) (2008). The assignment of a Risk Level II to the offender was supported by substantial evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The beneficiary received Section 8 housing assistance and also received additional housing assistance for a live-in aide, who also owned the  property in which the beneficiary resided. On the application for assistance, the beneficiary identified the live-in aide as a household member, but did not disclose that she also then owned the property. Subsequently, the Agency informed beneficiary that his assistance would be terminated for misrepresentation and that he would be required to repay the Agency for benefits overpaid. An informal hearing was held and the assistance was terminated. On certiorari appeal, the court affirmed and held that the Agency did not abuse its discretion in terminating benefits because substantial evidence in the record supported the Agency's finding that the beneficiary misrepresented the fact that he was living in an owner-occupied housing unit, thereby making him ineligible for benefits. Substantial evidence demonstrated that at all times when the beneficiary was receiving assistance the live-in aide either owned the property or had an interest in the property other than living there exclusively for the purpose of the beneficiary's care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Agency's decision terminating the beneficiary's Section 8 housing assistance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver moved to have &sect; 171.165, subd. 1 declared unconstitutional because it delegated to the federal Department of Transportation the power to define both the circumstances in which a Minnesota driver was disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle and the penalties for disqualification. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that &sect; 171.165, subd. 1 was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because the provision fell within an exception for auxiliary statutes. The court affirmed. The driver lacked standing as he could not show that his injury was fairly traceable to a constitutional violation because the driver's commercial license would have been disqualified regardless of whether the statute incorporated future changes to the federal regulations because the operative, disqualifying regulation had remained unchanged since incorporation in 2005. Only when the legislature attempted to incorporate future amendments along with extant federal law did a delegation issue arise. The effect of Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.01, subd. 20 was to adopt the federal law by reference as it existed at the time the statute was adopted.</SPAN></P>

The application for the search warrant adequately described with particularity the items at the residence subject to seizure. Those items included contraband, methamphetamine, and currency.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Swift County District Court (Minnesota), which denied a motion to dismiss the felony charge of issuing dishonored checks with a value of more than $500, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.535, subd. 2a(a)(1) (2008), on equal protection grounds. Defendant alleged the statute was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with one felony count of issuing dishonored checks, valued at more than $500, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.535, subd. 2a(a)(1). She filed to dismiss the charge, alleging &sect; 609.535, subd. 2a(a)(1) was unconstitutional and violated her equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. Defendant conceded she was not a member of a suspect class. The trial court ruled the equal protection challenged failed but certified the question for appeal. Defendant alleged that had she been charged with theft by check, she would have been charged with a gross misdemeanor. The court answered the question in the negative. It ruled the disparity in sentences was not enough to shock the senses. Defendant did not meet her burden of showing that &sect; 609.535, subd. 2a(a)(1) failed the rational basis test. The two statutes fell under the lesser included offense and did not foreclose the State from deciding under which statute defendant would be prosecuted. The fact defendant wanted to be prosecuted under one statute rather than the other did not mean that the State was obligated to prosecute her that way. Defendant did not meet her burden of proving disparate treatment.</SPAN></P>

The employee's criticisms were a matter of public concern, even though she raised them in the workplace. The employee's right to speak about the program outweighed the State's interest in an orderly workplace. The employee alleged facts sufficient to establish a First Amendment violation.

At trial, the victim stated that she did not tell the officers that there were weapons in the apartment and she was told she would be arrested if she did not sign the consent form. On appeal, the court concluded that the officers had consent to enter and search the bedroom of the apartment and that the discovery of the weapons was not the result of an unlawful search. The district court had clearly found the officers' testimony to be more credible. The court next decided that the district court was well aware of its authority to depart when sentencing and acted within its discretion in not doing so. At one point, the district court referenced the defense's request to &quot;depart from that guideline requirement.&quot; Finally, defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was without merit because the alleged errors all involved trial strategy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant renter sought review of a decision of respondent, the Dakota County Community Development Agency (Minnesota), which terminated her housing assistance pursuant to 24 C.F.R. &sect; 982.551(h)(2) (2008). The Agency had terminated the housing assistance and required her to pay back a year's worth of assistance after it determined that the renter allowed her boyfriend to stay unreported in her unit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The renter appealed the Agency's decision by arguing that the evidence was insufficient to establish that she violated the program rules. The court determined that substantial evidence supported a finding that she allowed her boyfriend to stay with her unreported beyond the allowable temporary period in violation of 24 C.F.R. &sect; 982.551(h)(2) (2008). The record included evidence that the boyfriend resided with the renter during the 11 days between his release from jail and the execution of a search warrant, which was beyond the maximum time allowed of ten days. The renter's diary entries strongly suggested that her boyfriend resided with her beginning with his release from jail and the deputies' discovery of him sleeping in her master bedroom. However, the Agency lacked a sufficient factual basis to require the renter to repay a year's worth of benefits. The Agency's reimbursement calculation hinged on the boyfriend living with the renter for the entire rental year, which was clearly improper based upon the evidence that showed him living with the renter for only 11 days. Thus, the reimbursement amount calculation should have been for only a month instead of a year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 17-year-old student assistant became acquainted with respondent, the district superintendent. She sent him an e-mail indicating her interest in pursuing a relationship with him. When the district superintendent spurned her advances, her behavior became increasingly harassing and threatening to both the superintendent and his wife. For the protection of his wife and children, the superintendent obtained a harassment restraining order. On review, the court held that the student assistant's communications and conduct constituted a substantial invasion of the superintendent's privacy to warrant the issuance of the harassment restraining order under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.748 because it showed that she sent him numerous e-mails and handwritten letters, made unannounced appearances at his office, sent facsimiles to his wife's place of employment representing that the superintendent was engaged in an extramarital affair, and sent an e-mail to the school board indicating that she had concerns about the superintendent's emotional and mental well-being.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that the failure to file a suppression motion constituted deficient performance under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. However, it was reasonable for the attorney to advise appellant not to challenge the arrest and search because the evidence seized was admissible under the inevitable-discovery doctrine. An investigatory stop was justified based on an off-duty officer's observations of appellant and another individual in a parking lot. A hammer and spark plugs found on appellant were admissible due to the search incident to arrest exception since there was an outstanding warrant on appellant. Even if appellant was searched before the discovery of the warrant, the evidence was admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine. However, the conviction for tampering with a motor vehicle was not supported by sufficient evidence. Tampering under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.546(2) required that defendant engage in conduct that resulted in some degree of change or alteration to, or substantial interference with, a vehicle. Appellant's act of manipulating a door handle for 10-15 second was not sufficient where there was no damage to the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction for tampering with a motor vehicle was reversed. The conviction for possession of theft tools was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Itasca County District Court (Minnesota) that convicted him of five counts of first-degree assault, use of deadly force against a peace officer, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.221, subd. 2(a) (2008), for firing a single gunshot from inside his home as five officers attempted to enter, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to show that he had the specific intent to cause fear in more than two individuals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five law enforcement officers went to defendant's home to execute a search warrant. Unbeknownst to them, defendant was anticipating a visit from two drug dealers who had threatened to kill him if he did not pay them the money that he owed, and he was waiting for them with a loaded gun at his side. Defendant did not hear the officers announce their presence, but when he saw that his door was being kicked in, he fired on shot, intending to scare the intruders away, and hit the doorknob. When defendant learned that the intruders were actually sheriff's deputies, he ceased resistance and permitted the officers to enter. Defendant was charged with five counts of first-degree assault, one count for each officer standing outside of defendant's door when he fired. On review, the court held that, where defendant testified that he believed drug dealers were outside of his home, that he believed that the two drug dealers who threatened him brought others with them, and that he fired his gun to scare whoever was outside attempting to enter his home, his testimony constituted sufficient evidence to support a finding that he intended to inflict fear in everyone at his door.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed, but because the trial court erred in ruling that defendant was entitled to supervised, the case was remanded for correction of sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with second-degree possession of controlled substance (count 2), methamphetamine-related crime involving children (count 3), and possession of drug paraphernalia (count 4). The Nobles County District Court, Minnesota, dismissed counts 2 and 3 pursuant to defendant's motion to suppress. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A search warrant was issued for the residence where defendant, his wife, and three minor children resided. The search warrant did not authorize a search of any person. The appellate court ruled that the district court erred by dismissing count 3, because based on the officer's reasonable belief that the meth pipe constituted methamphetamine paraphernalia and that three minor children resided at the residence searched, the officer had probable cause to believe that defendant violated Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.137, subd. 2(a)(4). Also, the district court erred by suppressing the methamphetamine found in defendant's pants pockets (count 2). During the execution of the search warrant the officer discovered white powder residue, which field-tested positive for methamphetamine. The officers therefore had probable cause for a felony arrest of defendant before they concluded their search. Had the officer arrested and searched defendant, based on felony probable cause, he would have inevitably discovered the methamphetamine in defendant's pants pockets. Furthermore, as to count 4, the district court did not err by concluding that the meth pipe would inevitably have been discovered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker argued that the decision was not supported by substantial evidence and was arbitrary and capricious, and that he was deprived of due process because no evidentiary hearing was held. The appellate court noted that the legislature placed violations of Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.713 and Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.022 in the 15-year disqualification category rather than in the 10-year or 7-year categories, indicating that the legislature considered them severe. DHS found that the events resulting in the worker's convictions placed him in a higher risk category because the events were intentional, overt, violent.  The worker could not simultaneously perform operations services for Rayito de Sol, as he claimed on his request for reconsideration, and have no involvement with Rayito de Sol operations, as the settlement agreement required. Thus, the statement that the worker provided conflicting and inconsistent information on his role at Rayito de Sol was supported by substantial evidence. DHS completed a second risk assessment form on the worker after reviewing the supplementary material. DHS considered and made a determination on each factor. He was not denied due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city issued appellant landowner an order to abate a nuisance on his property. The landowner filed a complaint in the trial court requesting a declaration that a chapter of the city's legislative code was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The landowner appealed and initiated a certiorari appeal of the city council's resolution. The court consolidated the two appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the landowner asserted, inter alia, that the trial court had jurisdiction to consider his action against the city under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA), Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 555.01-.16 (2008). The court held that the UDJA gives courts power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed, but it did not confer on a court jurisdiction over an action. The landowner did not cite any authority that created a cause of action for the improper application of an ordinance. Because the substance of the landowner's declaratory judgment action was that the city council improperly applied its legislative code to his property, the action was not separate and distinct from his certiorari appeal of the city council's quasi-judicial decision, and the trial court correctly determined that it did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the action. Similarly, the landowner's assertion that his constitutional rights were violated failed because all decisions made by city council concerning the landowner's property were reviewable by certiorari.</SPAN></P>

After defendant was arrested based on probable cause that he committed domestic violence, he was taken to the police station and given a Miranda warning. The second statement that he made at this point was not inadmissible as fruit of the poisonous tree. The exclusionary rule did not bar the State's use of this statement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a fifth-degree controlled substance crime. At the omnibus hearing, defendant argued that the evidence should be suppressed as the fruit of an unconstitutional search and seizure of his person. The Blue Earth County District Court (Minnesota) agreed. Having suppressed the evidence, the district court dismissed the charge against defendant for lack of probable cause. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the passenger in a vehicle that was pulled over for a traffic violation. The officer ordered defendant to remain in the car while the traffic stop was effectuated. Another officer arrived at the scene and questioned defendant as to whether he &quot;had anything illegal on him.&quot; Defendant admitted he had a &quot;pot pipe.&quot; The officer then conducted a search of defendant's person and found other contraband. The court found that requiring defendant to remain in the vehicle was a valid detention under Terry v. Ohio, but the officer that searched defendant exceeded the purpose of the stop and did not have probable cause to search defendant. The officers' question was not reasonably related to the traffic stop -- the driver's failure to signal a turn and driving without a license. Defendant's possession of the pot pipe was a petty misdemeanor offense. Accordingly, discovery of the pipe did not give the officer probable cause to arrest and search defendant. Finally, the officer did not have any concerns for his safety.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged an order of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) that committed him as a sexually dangerous person (SDP) and sexual psychopathic personality (SPP), arguing that the evidence in the record was insufficient to support the SDP and SPP classifications and that his commitment violated the Double Jeopardy, Due Process, and Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. Constitution and the Minnesota Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued that his commitment could not stand because the record failed to contain clear and convincing evidence that he was highly likely to engage in future acts of harmful sexual conduct. On review, the court held that, although petitioner implied that his age of 56 precluded a finding that he was highly likely to reoffend, expert testimony established that petitioner's sexual offenses derived primarily from his sexual deviance, which, unlike general antisocial behavior, did not diminish with age. While petitioner contended that the record lacked clear and convincing evidence demonstrating that he had an inability to control his sexual impulses, experts opined that petitioner lacked any such control, and such evidence supported the district court's findings. In addition, petitioner's constitutional arguments lacked merit. The Minnesota Supreme Court previously held that Minnesota's SDP and SPP law under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02 (2008) did not violate an individual's rights regarding substantive due process, double jeopardy protection, or equal protection under the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants opened a business establishment that featured live nude dancing. The city council passed an anti-nudity ordinance, Zumbro Falls, Minn., Ordinance &sect; 09-02 (2009). The district court granted the city a temporary injunction against appellants based on its violation of the anti-nudity ordinance. The city demonstrated an important governmental interest based on several studies examining the harmful secondary effects of nude-dancing establishments. The district court's temporary-injunction order contained ample detailed findings and legal analysis to support its conclusion that the city was likely to succeed on the merits of its claim. The ordinance's incidental impact on the expressive element of nude dancing was de minimus. Because appellants' motion to dissolve the temporary injunction contained no allegation that the factual or legal bases for the issuance of the temporary injunction had ceased to exist, the district court did not abuse its discretion in summarily denying appellants' motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order without making factual findings.</SPAN></P>

Two tests confirmed that conclusion. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress and after the Lothenbach trial, it found him guilty of third-degree driving while impaired. The appellate court found that sunset was a climatic condition and that a belief as to when sunset on any particular day had occurred depended on observable facts, including the time of day, the sun's appearance, and general weather conditions.

Next, there was no violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV and Minn. Const. art.

An officer could have made an investigative stop based on an informant's tip if the tip was sufficiently reliable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to a kidnapping conviction, relator was a predatory offender who was required to register under Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166 (2008). He was assigned a Risk Level III. Relator argued that, because he denied ever committing a sexual offense, an assessor erred by using the Minnesota Sex Offender Screening Tool-Revised (MnSOST-R) to assess his risk level. The ALJ affirmed the Risk Level III assessment, and relator filed this petition. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the assessor here properly relied upon the charges against relator and a complaint's description of the incident as a basis to determine which assessment tool to employ. Consideration of the allegations in the complaint did not deprive relator of the opportunity to be meaningfully heard. Moreover, there was ample evidence in the record to support the assignment of a Risk Level III based on relator's lengthy criminal history, use of violence, and other factors. Finally, a due process argument was without merit because relator failed to demonstrate that any information about him affected a liberty interest that was disseminated due to his Risk Level III assignment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sex offender had been convicted of eight sexual offenses involving sexually assaulting unsuspecting female strangers. Evidence from the cases showed he punched two victims, threatened some victims, and assault some victims multiple times. After the sex offender completed his sentences, he was ordered to be committed as a Sexually Dangerous Person (SDP) and a Sexual Psychopathic Personality (SPP). The appellate court found that clear and convincing evidence showed he was an SDP because he had engaged in a course of harmful sexual conduct and was likely to do in the future, as contemplated by Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c(a) (2008). The same evidence showed that he was an SPP because his inability to control his sexual impulses made him a danger to other people, as contemplated by Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18b (2008). Furthermore, it found that his commitment was not unconstitutional since the statutes allowing for it provided for substantive due process, equal protection was not violated because sex offenders were not similarly situated to other offenders, and the commitment did not violate double jeopardy since the statutes contemplated treatment rather than punishment.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to state which landowner was responsible for maintaining the buffer, and that enforcement of the ordinance violated due process. The appellate court first found that the ordinance was sufficiently definite as required by U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 in requiring the landowner to provide the buffer. It found that before issuing the relevant citation to him, the city sent him three notices that the fence was not in compliance with the ordinance. It further found that he admitted receiving at least one of the three notices. Too, it rejected the contention that the evidence showed that the city had given him explicit permission to violate the ordinance; rather, it determined that he was not originally required to build the fence because his property was a nonconforming use, but that once he voluntarily built it he had an obligation to ensure that it complied with the city code.</SPAN></P>

The inspector took a photo and issued defendant a citation for violating Burnsville, Minn., City Code &sect; 10-7-26(F)(5) (2008), which barred the use of unapproved surface material in parking lots. Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of that ordinance violation. The appellate court found that (1) the evidence sufficiently supported the conviction because it showed that defendant had at least a general intent to violate the ordinance given that he was maintaining a parking area using unapproved material at the time the citation was issued and he had violated the ordinance before; (2) no exception to liability under that ordinance was provision had been shown to apply; and (3) the trial court could impose as reasonable conditions of probation that he remove the prohibited material in the area used for parking and ensure that his property complied with the ordinance to prevent him from violating it in the future.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The appellate court found that neither the sanctions nor contempt judgment could stand regarding the wife lender, as the record did not show a proper basis for those rulings. It then found that certain alleged wrongdoers could not maintain their sanction requests against the husband lender because they did not, pursuant to Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1995, the offender entered a plea to the offense of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct, and the conviction was later reduced to a misdemeanor after he was discharged from probation in 2001. The offender was not notified of his obligation to register until 2008. When the offender was later informed of registration requirements, he sought relief. The district court declined to grant relief, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that challenges to the lack of notice of collateral consequences, such as predatory offense registration, had been wholly rejected. Pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166, subd. 1b(a)(i), the misdemeanor arose out of the same set of circumstances for which the offender was originally charged and to which he pled guilty. The offender was charged with and pled guilty to an offense that required him to register, and his claim of lack of notice did not establish a manifest injustice that would have allowed him to withdraw his 1995 guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was arrested on suspicion of driving while impaired. As a consequent of a urine test that revealed an alcohol concentration of.010, respondent Commissioner of Public Safety revoked the licensee's driver's license. The licensee petitioned the district court to rescind the revocation, but the district court denied the requested relief. On review, the court held that the licensee failed to establish that the administration of a urine test violated his constitutional right to equal protection under Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. There were genuine and substantial reasons for the testing scheme; three testing methods were authorized, thereby ensuring that a reliable testing method was available; and the testing scheme furthered the implied consent law's purpose of promoting public safety. Further, under Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement applied because the evanescent nature of the evidence created a condition that justified a warrantless search. No warrant was necessary to secure an alcohol concentration test where there was probable cause to suspect a crime in which chemical impairment was an element of the offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a trustee of property, challenged a judgment of the Sibley County District Court (Minnesota) that dismissed his suit against respondent county challenging the commercial classification of the trust property for tax purposes, arguing that the district court erred in holding that Minn. Stat. &sect; 278.01 provided his exclusive remedy and that no relief could be afforded through a declaratory judgment action under Minn. Stat. &sect; 555.01 (2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 278.01 provided the exclusive remedy for challenging a property tax classification and for challenging an assessment of real property. Assessment was the process by which taxable value was ascertained, and that process included the determination of market value, classification, and the application of class rates. Classification was an aspect of the assessment process in part because classification was integral to the assessor's function of ascertaining a property's taxable value. Because the trustee failed to comply with the notice requirements of Minn. Stat. &sect; 278.01, subd. 1(a), the district court properly dismissed his claim. Further, the district court did not err in concluding that the trustee could obtain no relief through a declaratory judgment action. Minnesota's Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA) was not available to test questions of valuations or assessments in real estate tax matters. Because classification was an aspect of assessment and because Minn. Stat. &sect; 278.01 was the exclusive remedy for challenging an assessment, the trustee could not challenge the classification under the UDJA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agent argued, inter alia, that the hearing officer erred in making him personally responsible for the citations because he was not the owner of the properties and the corporate owners should have been ordered to pay the citations. The court of appeals agreed. The citations for violating the dumpster ordinance were issued to the apartment complex corporations. Although the agent corresponded with the city in his capacity as an agent and acted on behalf of the corporations, it was undisputed that the agent was not the owner of either property. The evidence showed that corporations were the owners of the properties. The issue of the agent's personal responsibility for the citations was not an issue at the administrative hearing, and the hearing officer did not find that the agent, in his capacity as an agent, was personally responsible for the penalties. It was also undisputed that the documents on which the city relied in support of its argument for the agent's personal liability were not submitted to the hearing officer and, therefore, were not part of the record in this appeal. Therefore, the hearing officer arbitrarily and erroneously ordered the agent to pay the citations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) of second-degree murder. After the district court denied defendant's petition for postconviction relief, the stay of appeal was dissolved, and defendant's appeal was allowed to include issues raised and decided in the postconviction proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the postconviction court erred by summarily denying his request for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The court of appeals disagreed. In his petition for relief, defendant asserted that a previously unidentified witness would testify that defendant was on a city bus with the witness at the time of the shooting and would thereby provide defendant with an alibi defense. However, the postconviction court correctly reasoned that defendant's alleged presence on a city bus with another person at the time of the crime was known to defendant at the time of trial. There was no indication that defendant or defense counsel investigated whether there were witnesses who could corroborate defendant's assertion that he was on the city bus at the time of the shooting. There was no indication that defendant attempted to discover the identity of any of the passengers on the bus that night or that he attempted to view surveillance video of the bus or of the bus stop in an effort to learn the witness's identity. Finally, nothing in the record indicated that defendant ever suggested, prior to the postconviction proceeding, that he had an alibi defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Goodhue County District Court (Minnesota) denied defendant's motion to correct or reduce his sentence in a case where defendant entered an Alford plea to attempted fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. Defendant in that case had been sentenced to 36 months in prison, followed by a 10-year conditional release term; too, the trial court imposed a no-contact order prohibiting him from any contact with the victim. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was sentenced following entry of his Alford plea to a charge of attempted fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct, defendant filed a motion to correct his sentence. He claimed that the sentence was improperly enhanced based on a civil commitment imposed upon him as a sexually dangerous person. He also claimed that the sentence was not authorized by law and that a no-contact provision in the sentence barring him from contacting the victim was impermissible. The appellate court found that the civil commitment did not violate his due process rights under either the Fourteenth Amendment or Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 because it was a completely separate matter from his criminal offense. It also found that he did not show that the sentence imposed upon him was contrary to law with the exception of the no-contact order. With regard to that order, it found that a person sentenced under the relevant statute for the criminal sexual conduct offense, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.345, subd. 1, could not be subjected to a no-contact order because the language of that statute set forth the punishment that could be imposed and did not include the imposition of a no-contact order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment except to the extent that defendant's sentencing order imposed a no-contact order, which the trial court reversed. It also remanded the case to the trial court with directions that the trial court vacate the no-contact order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was arrested for driving while impaired, and he provided a urine sample. An examination of the sample revealed an alcohol concentration that was above the legal limit for driving, and a license revocation was entered. The trial court determined that the urine sample was not unreliable and that the licensee's rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV had not been violated. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court held that the licensee waived the issue of whether a Frye-Mack hearing was necessary to establish the general acceptance of a first-void urine test within the relevant scientific community. Also, because the licensee offered testimony identical to that offered in the case of Hayes v. Comm'r of Pub. Safety to prove that the urine-test method was unreliable, he was unable to contest the foundational reliability of the urine test with expert testimony or try to show that the test was inadmissible under Minn. R. Evid. 702. Next, the licensee's chain of custody argument was rejected. Finally, the urine test was not subject to suppression under U.S. Const. amend. IV because the exigent circumstances exception clearly applied in the implied-consent context.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that the facts and circumstances known to the police to justify a warrantless extraction of bodily fluids had to support a reasonable belief that testing would disclose some amount of alcohol or drugs in defendant's body. The officer was aware of no circumstances indicating even non-intoxicating levels of chemical consumption. He noticed no alcoholic odor or signs of physical impairment, and he was aware of no facts suggesting that defendant had recent access to drugs or alcohol. The preliminary breath test indicated no alcohol use. Defendant's late response to traffic conditions created a dilemma leading to his deadly split-second decision. That defendant was driving with faulty brakes and inadvertently drove into oncoming traffic while attempting to use friction against the median to avoid rear-ending another vehicle did not support a reasonable belief that he had alcohol or drugs in his system.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed. The father testified that, although he did not consider the basement to be &quot;a private area&quot; for his son, it &quot;was his downstairs. I was upstairs.&quot; Defendant testified that his father never went down into the basement because &quot;he can't get up and down the stairs.&quot; Defendant acknowledged that, if his father were able, he could go into the basement and use the washer and dryer. At best, the facts supported an inference that the father had joint access to the basement area. Therefore, the father had no actual authority to consent to a search of defendant's basement living quarters. Nothing in the facts the officers had before entering defendant's basement residence showed any mutuality of use of that area. Their belief that the father as owner of the entire house would likely have joint access with his son to all areas of the house, even if correct, was nevertheless insufficient as a matter of law to demonstrate apparent authority to consent to a search of defendant's living quarters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Dakota County District Court (Minnesota) that convicted her of four counts of failure to remit sales tax for the years 2001 through 2004 in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 289A.63, subd. 1(b) (2004), arguing that the district court erred in denying her motion to suppress evidence obtained through search warrants that failed to strictly comply with Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the search warrants' technical violations of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 626.05 and 626.11(a) did not render the warrants invalid and did not warrant the suppression of evidence obtained as a result of the searches. Specifically, the search warrants were not invalid for failing to adhere to the requirement that the warrant &quot;command&quot; or &quot;direct&quot; a peace officer to make a search but appeared to only &quot;request&quot; the search; the failure of language of command did not undermine the purpose of the statute, and thus the statutory noncompliance did not necessitate the suppression of evidence obtained during execution of the search warrants. Further, the search warrants were not invalid for failure to adhere to the requirement that the issuing judge sign the warrant because that requirement was a purely ministerial task that, in at least certain circumstances, could be delegated to the applicant, as along as the issuing judge performed the substantive tasks of determining probable cause and ordering the issuance of the warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his brief stay in the suspected drug dealer's car failed to establish a reasonable, articulable suspicion of crime justifying the seizure of the car in which he was riding. The court of appeals disagreed. A detective had a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity to justify the investigatory stop of defendant's vehicle. Detectives watched a suspected drug dealer under investigation stop in a large commercial parking lot far from the store entrance in a vehicle that he had driven to three recent controlled buys and that was subject to an active search warrant for drugs. The detectives considered the suspicious circumstances: defendant's car stopped next to the drug dealer's car, defendant entered the drug dealer's car, defendant reached down toward the floor, and defendant returned to his car after less than one minute. Also, despite the retail location of the encounter, defendant demonstrated no interest in legitimate shopping. One of the detectives testified that he learned in his six years' experience in drug enforcement that drug deals commonly occurred in busy commercial parking lots.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant farmer sought review of a judgment of the Sibley County District Court (Minnesota) dismissing his claims against respondents, state and others, relating to an inspection of his seed-growing and handling facility and holding that the state could conduct a warrantless inspection of the facility, his negligent-supervision claim failed as a matter of law, and that the state was immune from suit for an alleged defamation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the farmer's claims that Minn. Stat. &sect; 18J.04, subd. 1 and 2, which authorized a warrantless inspection of his seed-handling facility, violated his constitutional rights regarding searches and seizures, or that a state employee had been negligently supervised, were properly dismissed. The farmer's business was a &quot;closely regulated&quot; industry, Minnesota Seed Law, Minn. Stat. &sect; 21.80-.92, and the seed-inspection regulatory scheme fell within the exception to warrantless searches under the Burger analysis; therefore, the state could inspect the farmer's facility without a warrant. However, it was error to have determined that immunity based on the Minnesota Tort Claims Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 3.736, subd. 3(b), protected the state from liability for the state employee's allegedly defamatory remarks to the farmer's customers. Official immunity did not apply to a defamation claim, and the state did not enjoy vicarious official immunity from that claim. In addition, if the employee's allegedly defamatory statement was not part of his official duties or a critical public interest was not involved, then the defense of absolute privilege was also unavailable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the farmer's constitutional and negligent-supervision claims, but reversed the determination that immunity protected the state from liability based on the employee's allegedly defamatory remarks and remanded for consideration of factual issues relating to that claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hearing officer had concluded that the tenant was evicted; on appeal, the tenant argued, among other things, that she had not been evicted. The court concluded that there was evidence to support the hearing officer's conclusion that the tenant was evicted. The evidence presented included an eviction summons and complaint, a mutual termination agreement between the tenant and the landlord that stated that if the tenant failed to comply with all the conditions of the agreement a writ would be issued, and a writ that was issued and posted, then canceled. Under the plain language of 24 C.F.R. &sect; 982.552(b)(2), the housing authority was required to terminate the tenant's housing assistance if she was evicted for serious lease violations. The tenant's failure to pay utilities and provide garbage services were serious violations of her lease. In addition, because eviction for a serious violation was mandatory, the hearing officer was not permitted to consider the tenant's claimed hardship. Therefore, the decision to uphold the termination of the tenant's housing assistance was not arbitrary and capricious for failure to consider mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant pled guilty to one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.342, subd. 1(a) (2004), for sexually assaulting a minor. The Scott County District Court (Minnesota) sentenced appellant to the presumptive term of 144-months with a 10-year conditional-release period; he did not seek a direct appeal. Appellant's postconviction petition was denied and he sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioned for postconviction relief and alleged that the imposition of a 10-year conditional-release period violated Blakely v. Washington, and argued that the general facts that he admitted at his plea hearing did not establish that any criminal conduct occurred after August 1, 2005, the effective date for a mandatory imposition of a 10-year conditional-release period. The court held that because appellant did not specifically admit to post-August 1, 2005 conduct, the district court's imposition of the 10-year conditional-release period was based on an implied finding that one or more of appellant's acts occurred after that date; this contravened the holding in Blakely. Appellant was entitled to have a jury determine the dates of his offenses beyond a reasonable doubt before the imposition of the conditional-release period. If the district court had not implicitly found that appellant engaged in a sexual act of penetration after August 1, appellant's conditional-release period would have been five years shorter. The court could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the outcome would have been the same without this error; therefore, the error was not harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded to the district court for resentencing, it did not reach appellant's constitutional argument, and held that his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) concluded that appellant was a sexually dangerous person subject to civil commitment pursuant to the Minnesota Commitment and Treatment Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c(a) (2008). Appellant sought review and argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that he was a sexually dangerous person subject to civil commitment and that the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first commitment hearing, appellant's long history of sex-related offenses was outlined and he was committed as a sexually dangerous person to the Minnesota Sex Offender Program on an interim basis. At the follow up hearing the district court concluded that nothing had changed since appellant's original commitment, that he continued to meet the requirements for commitment, and his indeterminate commitment was ordered. The court upheld the legal conclusion that appellant was subject to commitment as a sexually dangerous person and held that the Act was constitutional. Both court-appointed experts ultimately agreed that appellant met the criteria for commitment as a sexually dangerous person. The evidence showed that he had a lengthy history of harmful sexual conduct, and remained an untreated sex offender who had never admitted to a sexual offense. All of the actuarial instruments indicated that he was highly likely to reoffend. Importantly, the evidence showed that appellant's aggressive and sexually inappropriate behavior had never ceased, even while incarcerated or under supervision. Finally, appellant provided no evidence that any other treatment program would accept him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency notified the tenant that his rental assistance was being terminated due to unreported income from another Section 8 property. The tenant received unreported payments from another public housing agency as the manager of a Section 8 property that he owned. The tenant maintained that he did not use any of the funds for his own benefit and applied the funds to make improvements to the property. The court concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the hearing officer's credibility determination rejecting the tenant's claim that he was merely managing the property on someone else's behalf. The tenant's evidence that the payments were spent solely on property improvements consisted of handwritten notes on bank statements; he produced no receipts from any building supply or home-improvement store. Further, the tenant's due process contentions were not persuasive. The notice the tenant received effectively communicated to him the interest at stake, and the hearing officer did not arbitrarily and capriciously overlook important extenuating circumstances. The hearing officer demonstrated that she weighed any mitigating effect of the tenant's situation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Proceeding pro se, appellant inmate sought review of a summary judgment entered by the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota), which dismissed his First Amendment constitutional claims against respondents, the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) and three prison employees. The inmate alleged that DOC magazine and book policies unconstitutionally impinged upon his First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DOC policy only allowed inmates to receive books from an authorized vendor or publisher in order prevent someone from introducing contraband or coded messages into the prison through a book. The inmate was denied access to a copy of a book printed from the Internet. DOC policy further provided that inmates could only receive magazines sent as part of a subscription rather than individual magazines because of the large number of magazines that had to be screened. Applying the Turner analysis for assessing the validity of a prison regulation that interfered with an inmate's First Amendment rights, the court concluded that summary judgment for respondents was proper. The magazine policy was neither arbitrary nor irrational, and the book policy was rationally related to a legitimate and neutral government interest. While a complete ban on Internet materials might not comply with Turner, the vendor/publisher policy applied equally to bound books and books printed from the Internet. Finally, the inmate's pro se motions for appointment of counsel and class certification were properly denied because he failed to comply with Minn. R. Gen. Prac. Dist. Ct. 115.02-.04.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Minnesota's criminal test-refusal statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2, violated his substantive due process rights by making it a crime for him to refuse to voluntarily provide potentially inculpating evidence of another crime. The court rejected his constitutional challenge because defendant did not show under the under the facts of the case that he possessed a constitutional right to withhold consent to the alcohol-concentration test. During his traffic stop and DWI arrest, defendant displayed obvious signs of intoxication. A preliminary breath test revealed an alcohol concentration of.175. The officer who arrested defendant had reason to believe that his body contained evidence of alcohol that could disappear during the time that it would take to seek out a magistrate and obtain a search warrant. Consequently, the Fourth Amendment did not require the officer to obtain either a warrant or defendant's consent before collecting the evidence. Because defendant's arguments were based on an incorrect premise, he did not meet his very heavy burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent county changed the classification of real property owned by petitioner taxpayer from residential non-homestead to commercial on January 2, 2008, for taxes payable in 2009. The taxpayer filed a petition on May 19, 2009, claiming in part that the county assessor misclassified the property. The county moved for summary judgment, seeking a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction over the petition on the ground that it was untimely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer claimed that the property was overvalued and assessed unfairly and unequally. It further alleged that the tax was illegal and unconstitutional. The petition asked for relief for one year for those taxes payable in 2009. The taxpayer did not file a verified claim with the county nor did the county issue a denial of the claim before the petition was filed. The court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the taxpayer's untimely claim. First, the taxpayer's counsel conceded that the taxpayer had received notice of the change in classification in 2008, prior to February 28, 2009. Thus, the exception to the April 30 deadline in Minn. Stat. &sect; 278.01, subd. 4, was not applicable. Second, in order to fall within the longer filing period under Minn. Stat. &sect; 278.14 concerning refunds of mistakenly billed taxes, a taxpayer had to first file a verified claim with the county. After a denial of the claim, the taxpayer had 60 days to appeal. Because the taxpayer failed to file an application with the county and did not receive a denial, there was no decision of the county from which to appeal. Thus, &sect; 278.14 was not applicable, and the claim was untimely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court rejected the father's contention that the district court failed to consider his financial resources or needs in denying his motion to modify his support obligation. The district court reserved the father's motion for a downward departure from the support guidelines and allowed the father the opportunity to submit the financial information necessary to a determination of the issue. The father failed to submit additional information, and the lack of supporting documentation was the specific reason given by the district court for denying the father's motion for a departure. The father could not complain about the district court's failure to rule in his favor when the reason it did not do so was because the father failed to provide the district court with the evidence that would allow the district court to fully address the issue presented. Further, the father was not entitled to a reinstatement of his driver's license under Minn. Stat. &sect; 518A.65(e)(2) because he was unemployed, was not pursuing all available jobs in his area, and failed to enter into a payment agreement under Minn. Stat. &sect; 518A.65(c).</SPAN></P>

Petitioner waived the right to challenge the admissibility of the expert's testimony and the exhibits related thereto by failing to object at the time of trial. It would be a serious departure from the Minnesota Rules of Evidence and standard trial practice to allow a party to sit silently through trial, raising objections to evidence and witnesses testimony after the record was closed and post-trial briefs had been submitted. No new issues were raised in respondent's initial post-trial brief regarding the subject matter addressed in petitioner's reply brief. Because petitioner's reply brief went beyond the scope of responding to respondent's arguments, petitioner's challenge to the expert's testimony was improper and untimely.</SPAN></P>

The State did not contest defendant's argument that the officer had no articulable basis to believe that defendant was engaged in illegal activity or was in need of emergency assistance when the officer pulled behind defendant's car and activated his emergency lights.  Moreover, the officer testified that he had no reason to suspect that defendant was violating the law until he spoke to defendant and observed signs of intoxication. The facts indicated that the officer pulled behind defendant and activated his emergency lights only after defendant had stopped his car on the shoulder of the road at night far from any town. The officer did not use his siren or lights to stop defendant's vehicle.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant worked as a driver for the employer for several months. The employer was a company that transported vehicles for other companies. The applicant was not an owner-operator and did not own or lease the vehicles she drove for the employer. The employer then discharged her for violating federal trucking regulations, and for disobeying an order to stop driving and take a rest break. She denied violating any regulation or disobeying an order to take a rest break. After her discharge, she applied for unemployment benefits, and the Department issued a determination of eligibility. An unemployment law judge (ULJ) held an evidentiary hearing and upheld that determination of eligibility after applying Minn. Stat. &sect; 268.035, subd. 25b (Supp. 2009) to determine that she was an employee and not an independent contractor. The appellate court found that the ULJ erred in applying Minn. Stat. &sect; 268.035, subd. 25b (Supp. 2009) and its predecessor, Minn. Stat. &sect; 268.035, subd. 25b (2008), since neither statute applied.

Stat. &sect; 169A.63, subd. 8(d). The owner argued that  because she filed her claim in conciliation court, the procedural rules governing conciliation-court proceedings applied, and she therefore had 60 days to serve the summons on the state under Minn. R. Gen. Pract. 508(d)(1). The court held that pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 645.26, subd. 1 (2008), the specific 30-day statutory service deadline for forfeiture actions filed in conciliation court governed over the general 60-day deadline for other conciliation-court claims. Because the owner failed to comply with the statutory service requirements, she lost her right to a judicial determination of the forfeiture, as provided in &sect; 169A.63, subd. 8(e). Her constitutional claims raised in the context of the forfeiture action were governed by the service requirements of &sect; 169A.63.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed, stating in part that defendant failed to point to any caselaw that held that police could no longer act on developing concerns about officer safety once the passenger became free to walk away; the appellate court was also unaware of any caselaw. Therefore, defendant's contention that the deputy violated his constitutional rights by searching him after he was purportedly freed was rejected. Defendant's continued presence and interaction also provided the basis to reject his argument that the deputy's attempted pat-search illegally expanded the duration and scope of the traffic stop. Despite defendant's freedom to leave the scene, the circumstances indicated that the deputy developed a reasonable suspicion to pat-search defendant for weapons while he remained present. The district court did not err by refusing to suppress the evidence discovered after the deputy attempted to search him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sex offender appealed a judgment of the Carlton County District Court (Minnesota) that dismissed his claim against respondents, a sex offender program and program officials, arguing that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint under Minn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(e) on the basis that he failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sex offender was adjudicated a sexually psychopathic personality and was committed to a sex offender program for treatment. Part of the program protocol required that a strip search be performed before a sex offender would be permitted to shower. The sex offender refused to submit to a strip search; as a result, he was confined to protective isolation and was not permitted to shower, was not given clean clothes, and was denied access to the law library. He filed suit alleging a violation of his constitutional rights and seeking injunctive relief. On review of the judgment of dismissal, the court held that, because the complaint did not describe what the strip search entailed, it was not possible to fully analyze whether the strip search was constitutionally impermissible. Because it was the burden of the sex offender, as plaintiff, to plead sufficient facts to support his cause of action, the court could not conclude that the district court erred in dismissing his claim alleging that the strip searches routinely conducted as part of the sex offender program violated his constitutional right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.</SPAN></P>

However, the mother ended the visitation when a cousin allegedly exposed himself to the grandson. The grandmother, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 257C.08 (2008), petitioned for visitation. After a hearing, the trial court granted the visitation petition with protective provisions. The appellate court found that (1) the grandmother had standing under the statute to petition for visitation since the grandson had resided with her in excess of 12 months; (2) the grandmother showed that visitation would not interfere with the parent-child relationship; (3) the trial court did err in determining that the visitation schedule was in the child's best interests; and (4) the trial court's application of Minn.

An ICE agent retrieved copies of the documents and forwarded them to police who arrested defendant. Defendant argued that she never consented to the search as ICE agents claimed. The district court concluded that any violation by ICE agents only resulted in a tip to local law enforcement who then conducted a separate, independent investigation obtaining documents from other sources. The court disagreed. The independent source doctrine permitted the admission of evidence obtained during an unlawful search if the police could have retrieved the evidence on the basis of information obtained independent of their illegal activity. Here, the police obtained the documents from the ICE agent. The matter was remanded because the district court assumed without analysis that the search was unconstitutional and because the court could not make factual findings on credibility issues concerning consent.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed because the misconduct charge did not allege an act that exceeded defendant's statutory lawful authority, as defined by Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.43(2). The state specifically based the charge on an alleged violation of an administrative requirement, and the act of improperly preparing payroll forms was not an action intended to be a criminal offense under the official misconduct statute. It was an administrative personnel procedure with no criminal ramifications if violated. The court did not reach the issue of the statute's constitutionality, nor did it address defendant's argument that his conviction for misconduct of a public officer, when coupled with a hung jury on the remaining theft-by-swindle charges, was perverse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted second-degree murder. He was then sentenced.

The trial court agreed with the State that the postconviction petition was untimely filed and dismissed it on that ground.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1999, appellant was charged with attempted second-degree intentional murder and first- and second-degree assault. The trial court found appellant guilty as charged. In 2000, the district court sentenced appellant to 20 years in prison. In 2001, the appellate court affirmed his conviction on direct appeal. In 2008, appellant filed a petition for postconviction relief, claiming among other things that his sentence was unconstitutional under Blakely. The district court held that appellant's postconviction petition was barred by the two-year statute of limitations set forth in Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.01, subd. 4(a) (2008). The Court of Appeals of Minnesota upheld the decision. Because appellant argued for the first time on appeal that Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.01, subd. 4(a) was unconstitutional, the appellate court would not review his claim. Blakely did not apply retroactively to appellant's sentence. Appellant's motion to remove two judges was untimely and without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Beltrami County District Court (Minnesota) that convicted him of a first-degree controlled substance offense under Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.021, subd. 2(1) (2004), arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for speeding, but the police officer prolonged the search after issuing the citation and discovered drugs. On review, the court held that the district court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress because the search of defendant's vehicle was improper. Defendant's suspected drug activity did not provide the officer with a reasonable basis to suspect defendant of unlawful conduct related to stealing or tampering with vehicles, and the broken glove compartment did not afford reasonable suspicion either because its condition was consistent with the age and overall condition of the vehicle. Further, while a list of vehicle titles could be suggestive of criminal activity, the officer knew that defendant had a mechanical shop or a car dealership and had numerous cars registered to him. Given those facts, the presence of a list of vehicle titles in defendant's glove compartment was not suggestive of criminal activity. In addition, without other evidence to suggest criminal activity, the nervousness of the vehicle's occupants alone was a common response to being stopped by the police and not suggestive of criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner argued that the district court had jurisdiction over his claims for declaratory judgment, Minn. Stat. &sect; 555.01 (2008). The appellate court noted that the landowner was asserting that his rights had been violated by the city's quasi-judicial action and was not making an independent challenge to any legislative action by the city. The landowner was asserting that the city made its quasi-judicial decision in excess of its statutory authority, an argument properly addressed on certiorari review, Minn. Stat. &sect; 14.69 (2008). The appellate court was unable to conclude from the landowner's pleadings that he had cited any valid claim under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act over which the district court could have exercised jurisdiction. The landowner's references to federal statutes did not assert violations of those statutes separate from the city's demolition orders and involved inquiry into the demolition decisions, making certiorari alone his avenue of review.</SPAN></P>

The sheriff denied his application on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood that appellant would be a danger to himself or the public. The district court denied his petition for review, citing appellant's criminal record which included: assault charges against his girlfriend; a conviction for check fraud; a domestic assault charge; and charges for possession of a controlled substance and driving while impaired. The Court of Appeals of Minnesota upheld the district court's decision, and held that denial of the petition did not require conviction of a crime; it only required that the underlying conduct show that appellant would be a danger to himself and the public if authorized to carry a pistol. Appellant's claim that district court erred by finding that he was mentally ill lacked merit, because the court made no such finding.</SPAN></P>

The district court found that the patient's conduct relating to the victim and her family resulting in his conviction was a result of his desire to exercise power and control over the victim so that he could continue his sexual relationship with her and satisfy his sexual desires. A witness testified at the criminal trial that the patient was angered by the victim's parents' efforts to end the sexual relationship between their daughter and the patient and that he engaged in criminal conduct toward her parents for the purpose of causing the parents to cease their interference. The victim testified that, at the time of the patient's threats, she had fear and that she continued to have fear and slept with a knife under her pillow when she was home alone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court construed Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.023, subd. 3(b) to mandate a minimum two-year sentence. The court agreed with the district court's conclusion, observing that principles of lenity were not to be invoked when the statute at issue was not ambiguous. Thus, the district court correctly determined that it did not have discretion to exercise lenity and grant a downward dispositional departure. The court further held that &sect; 152.023, subd. 3(b) did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because it did not give prosecutors discretion to move for sentencing without regard to the statutory minimum sentences. Moreover, the disparate treatment of a co-defendant who was charged under a different provision did not entitle defendant to a dispositional departure and did not give rise to an equal protection or due process violation. The possibility that a law might fail to operate with equality was not enough to invalidate it. Although a prosecutor's decision whether to charge a defendant under &sect; 152.023, subd. 3(b) or some other provision might be influenced by the penalties available upon conviction, this fact, standing alone, did not render the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with several offenses involving criminal sexual conduct but was not convicted based upon his lack of competency to stand trial. The State filed a petition to civilly commit appellant as an SDP. Appellant argued that the proceedings should be bifurcated to first determine whether, under a proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard, he actually committed the sexual offenses. The district court declined to do so. After trial, the district court issued an order for appellant's indeterminate commitment. On review, the court held that the State was not required to offer proof beyond a reasonable doubt in SDP commitment proceedings under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c(a), 253B.18, subd. 1, 253.185, subd. 1 (2008), where those proceedings were not preceded by criminal convictions. Further, the court held that appellant's lack of criminal convictions was not determinative of whether he was a sexually dangerous person. Based upon appellant's lengthy history of inappropriate sexual behavior, sufficient clear and convincing evidence supported the district court's determination that appellant engaged in a course of harmful sexual conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Dakota County District Court (Minnesota) that convicted him of driving while impaired (DWI) under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 169A.20 and.24, test refusal, giving false information to a peace officer under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.506, and driving after cancellation, arguing that the trial court erred in sentencing him on the false-information conviction because it arose out of the same behavioral incident as the DWI conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers initiated a stop of defendant's vehicle after observing it cross the highway's center line three times and after seeing a shiny silver can fly out of the vehicle's window. Defendant denied having identification, orally identified himself, and indicated that officers from the Department of Justice would arrive shortly. The officers detected the odor of alcohol and arrested defendant after he failed field sobriety tests. Upon a search of defendant's vehicle, the officers found a Wisconsin driver's license that revealed defendant's true identity. On review, the court held that the trial court erred in imposing sentences on defendant's convictions for both driving while impaired and giving false information to a peace officer because multiple sentences could not be imposed for two offenses if the second offense was committed in order to avoid apprehension for the first. By giving a false name and date of birth, defendant was motivated by a desire to avoid arrest, and he may have hoped that the officers would not notice that he was intoxicated and that providing false information would prevent the officers from discovering an outstanding warrant for his arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for providing false information to peace officer was reversed, but the remainder of the district court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for traffic violations. He identified himself, indicated that his license had been suspended, and told the officers that he did not own the van but knew the owner. The officers asked defendant to step out of the van; one officer did a quick pat down for weapons, while the other officer checked the area of the van where defendant had been sitting to ensure that there was no weapon that defendant could access if they allowed him to return to the vehicle. Because a pillow was blocking the officer's view, he lifted it and noticed that it was very heavy. He stuck his hand inside the pillow and discovered a handgun. On review, the court held that the suppression motion was properly denied. The officer who conducted the search testified that, if he had not discovered the firearm during the initial, abbreviated search, he could have verified defendant's identity, issued a citation, impounded the vehicle to secure it for the rightful owner, and conducted an inventory search. Because the vehicle would have been subject to an inventory search, the doctrine of inevitable discovery applied.</SPAN></P>

The district court properly concluded that the procedural bar applied to petitioner's argument based upon the state supreme court's recent Jackson ruling because the claim was known but not raised at the time of petitioner's direct appeal and when he filed his prior petitions for postconviction relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the district court erred under Minn. R. Civ. P. 26.02 in denying the driver's discovery motion because the driver established the relevancy of this information through affidavits from two expert witnesses who opined that, without access to the source code, it was not possible to determine if the breathalyzer was functioning as it was designed to do and that it was not possible to determine if the software was operating properly when analyzing a subject sample. However, the district court did not err in denying the driver's motion to suppress evidence of his blood-alcohol concentration. A warrantless search conducted pursuant to the implied consent statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.20 (2006), was not unreasonable because, under the exigency exception, no warrant was necessary to secure a blood-alcohol test where there was probable cause to believe that the driver was operating his vehicle while impaired. The rapid, natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood created single-factor exigent circumstances that justified the taking of a warrantless, nonconsensual blood draw.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 16-years-old when he was charged by delinquency petition with several offenses. He pled guilty to four counts, three of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and one of committing a crime for the benefit of a gang. In exchange, the State dismissed the remaining charges. He was then designated an extended jurisdiction juvenile (EJJ) and placed him on EJJ probation. Thereafter, it found that he had violated his EJJ probation. It then imposed the sentences and an additional 10-year sex-offender conditional-release term on him. The trial court later determined that the sentences were proper. He did not appeal. However, about four years later, he moved for postconviction relief. The trial court denied most of his petition as being procedurally barred. The appellate court found that his postconviction petition seeking to challenge the sentences imposed was time barred because it was not filed within Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.01, subd. 4(a)'s time limit, the claims barred were barred under Knaffla because they had not been previously raised in any direct appeal, and defendant did not support his claim that jail time credit included time spent in a residential treatment program.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the State of Minnesota presented sufficient evidence to show defendant's impairment. The arresting officer testified as to the odor of alcohol present around defendant, defendant's glassy eyes, and defendant's side-to-side stagger. The jury also watched a video in which defendant refused to take any test of his blood alcohol content, repeatedly told the officer that defendant was going to pee myself, and had trouble understanding the implied-consent advisory. Furthermore, the State presented evidence that defendant displayed distinct nystagmus in both eyes, which was indicative of alcohol impairment. In addition, although the district court did not instruct the jury as to the applicable prerequisites for implied consent, defendant did not show that the error affected his substantial rights. Finally, defendant did not show that his substantial rights were affected by an instruction that the jury was to draw no adverse inferences from defendant's failure to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second-degree intentional murder and attempted second-degree intentional murder. He petitioned for postconviction relief, contending that counsel was ineffective. Defendant contended that his counsel never asked him if he was the shooter, urged him to plead guilty without conducting an investigation, and advised defendant that there was no such thing as self-defense in Minnesota. On review, the court held that the trial judge did not act improperly in compelling trial counsel to testify under Minn. R. Evid. 614. The purpose of obtaining this testimony was to permit the trial court to make a reasoned decision about the sufficiency of his representation. Counsel for the State and defendant questioned the witness, and the trial court asked no questions of him and did not act in a manner that reflected partiality or bias toward either party. Further, because defendant maintained throughout trial that he was not the shooter, he could not also claim that he acted in self-defense.

The petitioner's driver's license was revoked under the implied-consent law, and he petitioned for judicial review. At the hearing, the petitioner moved for discovery of the source code for the Intoxilyzer 5000. The district court sustained the revocation and denied the motion for discovery. To show the relevancy of the source code, the petitioner submitted the affidavit of a forensic scientist, stating that access to the source code was necessary to determine whether the Intoxilyzer 5000 functioned in a scientifically reliable manner to assure accuracy and integrity in testing, as it was designed to do and as it was assumed to do when it was approved by the Commissioner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent pipeline companies brought an action in the Pennington County District Court (Minnesota) against appellant landowners pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 117.48 (2008), seeking to acquire a right-of-way across the landowners' property to install a pipeline. Pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 117.042 (2008), the companies sought quick-take title and possession of a pipeline easement. The district court granted these requests, and the landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies applied to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for a certificate of need and a pipeline routing permit. After six public information meetings, the MPUC concluded that the certificate should be issued. Additionally, a contested-case hearing was conducted, following six more public hearings. The administrative law judge determined that the certificate of need should issue. The court held that given the thoroughness of the findings, the district court did not clearly err in finding a public necessity for the pipeline. The landowners' arguments that the companies were not common carriers, that Minn. Stat. &sect; 216B.243 was preempted by the dormant commerce clause, and that &sect; 117.48 was unconstitutional special legislation, were rejected because they were not raised below. The court held that &sect; 117.48 unambiguously applied to associations that were qualified to do business in Minnesota, and that it therefore applied to the companies, regardless of their corporate form. The requirement for a certificate was not preempted by federal law regulating pipeline safety, because the Minnesota laws did not presume to address pipeline safety issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the district court.</SPAN></P>

HRA sent relator a letter on June 6 informing her that it would be terminating her section 8 assistance. A hearing officer issued his decision terminating relator's section 8 voucher assistance on the grounds that (1) she had an unreported household member living at her residence, and (2) she was involved in illegal-drug activity. The Court of Appeals of Minnesota held that the decision was not supported by substantial evidence. Relator testified that her boyfriend was never in her unit for 10 hours or more per day for 14 days during a calendar year. A memo containing multiple levels of hearsay and an e-mail that was not provided to relator prior to the hearing could not support the hearing officer's finding that relator possessed drugs.</SPAN></P>

Relator called the CDA and stated that the man would be staying at her residence for more than ten days to assist with her children, because she had a medical condition. The CDA notified relator that her Section 8 housing benefits would be terminated, because she misrepresented her household composition and failed to obtain pre-approval to add an adult to her household. The Court of Appeals of Minnesota held that the decision was supported by substantial evidence. The hearing officer was not required to address the impact of the decision on relator's children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant received rental assistance under the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program administered by the CDA. Since 1994, the claimant had received a larger rental subsidy than typically provided to a single-person household, based on a live-in aide accommodation that allowed him to afford a two-bedroom unit. In 2006, the claimant indicated that he had multiple personal care attendants (PCA) rather than a single live-in aide, but he requested that the CDA recertify his accommodation based on the live-in status of his primary PCA. The claimant argued that the CDA did not have discretion to deny his request for a live-in aide. The appellate court ruled that the CDA's decision accorded with Section 8 regulations and related guidance. The claimant acknowledged having multiple or rotating caregivers to both the CDA and the hearing officer on several occasions throughout the proceedings. These admissions undermined his argument that a single live-in aide was essential to his well being. Although the claimant had a significant need for assistance, this need had historically been met by using multiple or rotating PCA's.</SPAN></P>

After he failed field sobriety tests but passed a breath test, he was placed in the back of the patrol car so that his identity could be verified because he was not in possession of his wallet. The officer asked defendant a few questions because the alcohol concentration levels were inconsistent with the level of impairment that he witnessed, and defendant admitted that he was also taking prescription drugs. Although he initially consented to a urine test, he subsequently declined all testing. On review of defendant's conviction, the court held that defendant's refusal of all testing preempted the requirement that he be offered an alternative test. Because defendant refused all testing, his rights under the implied consent laws were not violated, and he was lawfully charged with test refusal. Further, because defendant had not been arrested when he was seated in the patrol car, he was not in custody; as such, the officer's questioning of defendant did not violate defendant's Miranda rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1985, the applicant had been convicted of first-degree intrafamilial sexual abuse, in violation of Minn.

In 2008, he sought employment at another facility, a church. Due to amendments to the BSA, the Commissioner held that the applicant was permanently disqualified from direct-contact employment. The applicant argued that the Commissioner acted arbitrarily and capriciously in permanently disqualifying him for this conduct when he was previously granted a set-aside based on the same conduct. The court rejected his argument. A disqualified person who was granted a set-aside remained a disqualified person pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 245C.22, subd. 5 (2008). The applicant's estoppel argument failed because the issues presented were not identical, but involved two different employers, with an intervening statutory amendment. His equal-protection argument was meritless because the groups were not similarly situated, and there was a legitimate purpose for the statute: to protect children and vulnerable adults served by licensed facilities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After denying defendant's motion to suppress the victim's social security card that the officer found on him during an investigative stop and search, the Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, convicted defendant of theft from person, in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.52, subds. 2(1), 3(3)(d)(i) (2006), and imposed an executed prison sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress and by refusing to give the jury his requested instruction. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that the arresting officer was permitted to identify defendant even if he had not found the crack pipe, and he would have run defendant's name through the state computer to verify the name that defendant provided. That would have revealed the active warrant. Once the officer learned about the active warrant, he was required to arrest defendant. And when the officer arrested defendant, he was authorized to perform a search incident to the arrest, which would have produced the social security card. Thus, the officer would inevitably have discovered the social security card during the search incident to arrest. Denial of defendant's requested instruction was proper as the jury could not fully consider the circumstances of the photo lineup and compare defendant's photo to the other photos in the lineup because the district court had excluded the lineup photos from the evidence. Furthermore, the defense was given full opportunity to call into question the reliability of the eyewitness testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the driver contended the district court erred in sustaining the revocation of her driver's license as the warrantless search of her breath was unconstitutional. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the trooper administered the warrantless breath test based on his suspicion that the driver was driving while impaired. The trooper's suspicion that the driver was driving while impaired by alcohol created single-factor exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless search of the driver's breath. Thus, the search of the driver's breath was not a violation of her U.S. Const. amend. IV rights. Because the search is independently justified by exigent circumstances, it was irrelevant whether the driver gave consent or whether such consent was valid. Further, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the deficiency of the breath test was due solely to the driver's lack of cooperation. The driver intentionally did not provide a consistent breath sample necessary to yield a valid sample. That the trooper did not offer an alternative test after the driver failed to generate a breath sample did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) which convicted him of third-degree driving while impaired and careless driving. Specifically, defendant challenged the denial of his pre-trial motion to suppress evidence and the denial of his pre-trial discovery motion under Minn. R. Crim. P. 9.01, subd. 2(1) for disclosure of the source code of the Intoxilyzer breath-test machine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the discovery motion on the ground that defendant failed to make a sufficient showing of relevance. Defendant did not submit any documents in support of his motion. Instead, defense counsel make an oral proffer summarizing the opinions held by a software developer whom defendant had retained as an expert. Defendant's showing was insufficient to compel the conclusion that the district court abused its discretion. The proffer was conclusory, and the showing lacked a realistic prospect that the proposed expert review would lead to evidence favorable to the defense. The court also held that the district court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress the result of a breathalyzer test that revealed an elevated blood-alcohol concentration. With or without defendant's valid consent, the warrantless search of defendant's breath was not unreasonable under Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10. The search had independent justification in the exigent circumstances presented by the dissipation of the evidence of defendant's blood-alcohol concentration.</SPAN></P>

Also presented was the issue of whether fraudulent concealment and fraud on the court claims were separate causes of action even though they were not presented as separate causes of action in the amended complaint. The company had the opportunity to litigate the claims in the earlier action, and on its face, the claim of fraud was not meritorious. The district court did not err in determining that company failed to state a claim. The final issue was whether the district court erred in dismissing the amended complaint in light of the company's pending discovery requests. Nevertheless, Minn. R. Civ. P. 56.06 did not apply because the trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, and the company was not entitled to discovery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the beneficiaries raised several issues challenging the district court's ordering of the sale of the family home. The appellate court held that as tenants in common with the sibling, the children were entitled to bring the partition action. As the Minnesota Constitution did not recognize a jury right in equitable actions, the beneficiaries were entitled to a trial to the court, which they received, but not a trial by jury. The district court's denial of the admission of an article and videos was not an abuse of discretion as the article and videos were inadmissible hearsay not shown to fall within a hearsay exception. The record was devoid of any evidence that would have supported the beneficiaries claim that the district court judge committed misconduct by failing to view their case impartially. The beneficiaries' claim of potential permanent harm to purchasers or their children was speculative at best and not supported by any admissible evidence, nor was it supported by medical evidence. The beneficiaries asserted no state action that resulted in burdening their religious beliefs, and they failed to establish that their freedom of conscience was violated.</SPAN></P>

Due to the numerous indicia of intoxication, the officers ordered defendant from the car. Defendant exited, and a baggie containing cocaine fell to the ground. On review , the court held that counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress. Because there was an adequate basis for the stop and the search, a suppression motion would have been denied. The court further rejected defendant's challenged to the sufficiency of the evidence, which was based upon a conflict in the officers' testimony. Specifically, the officers disagreed about which of them saw the baggie fall out of defendant's pants.

Defendant took a bottle from his pocket, handed it to the trooper, and admitted that it contained cocaine. The troopers found more cocaine in the Jeep. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence of cocaine, arguing that the investigation exceeded the scope of the stop. The Court of Appeals of Minnesota upheld the investigation. The anonymous tip and defendant's driving aroused the trooper's suspicion that he was driving while impaired by drugs or alcohol. The trooper discovered the cocaine before he had a chance to complete the reasonably requested field sobriety tests, and his request for the testing was within minutes of the stop and consistent with the reason for the stop.

The trooper observed defendant's minivan and looked through its windows. He could see a pack of rolling papers and clear plastic baggy protruding from a black case. The baggy was the same type the trooper had observed numerous times as those containing illicit narcotics. He requested that a canine unit. The dog alerted on the back hatch of the van. Officers found a variety of contraband, including methamphetamine, inside the van. Defendant was charged with third-degree controlled-substance crime in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.023, subds. 2(1), 3(a) (2006). The trial court did not err by denying his motion to suppress the evidence derived from the dog sniff. The Court of Appeals of Minnesota held that the plastic baggy, the rolling papers, and the inference the trooper drew from these two objects, was sufficient to meet the reasonable suspicion standard.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was never told that he was eligible to possess a firearm and he was not misinformed of his eligibility to possess a firearm; rather, he was correctly informed of the duration of the firearm prohibition at that time. Defendant's claim under U.S. Const. amend. II failed because the Second Amendment did not apply to the states. Finally, his challenge under the Minn. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the City of St. Paul, challenged a judgment of the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota) granting a summary judgment in favor of respondent corporate landowner in a declaratory-judgment action brought by the City to demand that the landowner restore a fence along a contiguous public alleyway, pursuant to St. Paul, Minn., Legislative Code &sect;&sect; 63.114,.313 (2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's retail liquor store and contiguous customer parking lot were located along a public alley. The land across the alley was zone as residential. The landowner removed a fence that was erected along the alley, and the City demanded its restoration. The City sought a declaration that the landowner was in violation of various ordinances by removing the fence. The court held that, although the City could regulate access to the alleyway, the landowner was entitled to access to its property through the public alley unless such usage would cause harm to the public or infringe the rights of other property owners. The City's action of requiring a fence that prevented the landowner from alley access to its property was an unconstitutional taking of that property under the guise of regulation. The court held that judicial review was premature because administrative remedies were not exhausted, and it was not shown that it would be futile to pursue such remedies. The district court's determination that the City's action was a taking was reversed because there were genuine issues of material fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the action without prejudice, on the ground that judicial review was premature. The court reversed in part the district court's determination that the City's action was in effect a taking of the landowner's property and that the landowner satisfied the screening requirement of the applicable ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The owner appealed to the Minneapolis Department of Regulatory Services Agency, which upheld the fine. By petition for writ of certiorari, the owner challenged the applicable ordinance, Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances &sect; 341.300 (2009), as unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner contended that the ordinance, which  (1) was a regulatory taking, (2) violated the equal protection clauses of the United States and Minnesota Constitutions, (3) was unconstitutionally vague, and (4) violated the uniformity provision of the Minnesota Constitution, Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. The court rejected these arguments. The owner presented no authority supporting his claim that his property interest in operating licenses or permits were private property subject to a takings claim; therefore, no regulatory taking had occurred. His equal protection claim failed because taxicabs were not like hotel shuttles, limousines, buses, or other forms of transportation cited by the owner; rather, they were the sole transportation providers of their kind that were not already regulated by other entities. The ordinance was not void for vagueness. The city had defined a &quot;fuel efficient vehicle&quot; as a passenger vehicle with an EPA fuel consumption rating of 23 miles per gallon in city driving. &quot;Fleet&quot; clearly meant all vehicles operating under one license. The court rejected the owner's Uniformity Clause argument on the grounds that the ordinance was not a tax.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2 (2006). He waived his right to a jury trial and submitted the charge to the district court on a stipulated-facts hearing, preserving for appeal the question of the constitutionality of &sect; 169A.20. The district court found defendant guilty, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2, was unconstitutional because (1) it violated his substantive due process rights; (2) it violated the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures; and (3) it violated the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. The court rejected these arguments. Defendant's due-process rights were not violated either during the attempted administration of the chemical test or by his subsequent conviction. The arresting officer did not attempt to force the test or injure defendant. The officer requested a breath-alcohol test after, knowing that defendant recently had his license cancelled, he observed defendant drive his vehicle over the fog lines in the street. He followed defendant home and defendant attempted to quickly walk away, showing signs of intoxication. Additionally, defendant urinated on himself while in the back of the police car after being arrested. The court held that the officer had probable cause to suspect that defendant was driving while impaired and therefore was permitted to request a breath-alcohol content test under the exigent-circumstances exception to the warrant requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2005, the city assessed the owner's property and other properties in the neighborhood to finance street improvements. Special assessments to property owners were to finance 25-percent of the cost of the improvements, with the remaining 75-percent to be financed by public funding. The owner appealed the special assessment, and the appealed was denied. The appellate court ruled that the per-square-foot assessment rate applied to all properties of the same class was uniform, regardless of the fact that the amount of the assessment was higher on some properties than on others. Also, the owner had not presented convincing evidence that the special assessment exceeded the value of the benefit conferred. The street improvements would be reflected in the overall land value of a property, in that a buyer might be willing to pay more for a benefited property. Furthermore, the district court did not err by excluding evidence pursuant to the city's motion in limine or by not specifically addressing the owner's motion for judicial notice. The owner did not identify the information that was the subject of his motion for judicial notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient had an extensive criminal history, including criminal sexual conduct. Respondent Department of Corrections (DOC) petitioned to commit the patient as a sexually dangerous person (SDP).  The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, found the patient to be an SDP and committed him to the Minnesota Sex Offender Program (MSOP) for an indeterminate period. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the patient challenged his commitment as an SDP, claiming that the district court erred in finding that he was highly likely to reoffend and that Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c (2008) was unconstitutional as applied to him. The appellate court disagreed as the review examiner found that neither the patient's age nor his physical disabilities would reduce his risk of reoffense and that he lacked both a fundamental understanding of his sexual offending cycle and a relapse prevention plan. The patient did not refute any of the examiners' conclusions; he was already age 49 at the time of his second sexual offense and was an exception to the general principle that age lowered the risk of reoffense. His record showed that, when released from prison and even in confinement, the patient had a propensity to engage in violent behavior. His non-sexual offenses resulted from his inability to control anger and rage, which was in itself a cause of the sexual offenses. The patient had not had sex offender treatment, did not think he needed treatment, and had no relapse prevention plan. Appellate courts had already addressed and rejected the patient's constitutional arguments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the misdemeanor offense of hiring an adult for prostitution. The district court applied a penalty increase from misdemeanor to gross misdemeanor under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.3242 (2004), because defendant committed the offense in a park zone. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of Minnesota held that defendant's knowledge or ignorance of his presence in a park zone was irrelevant to the elements of the charged offenses. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by limiting the scope of closing argument to prohibit assertions that defendant did not know he was in a park zone when the hiring occurred. Defendant's right to a jury trial recognized in Blakely was not violated by the application of the enhanced penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Mower County District Court, Minnesota, convicting him of four counts of possession of a firearm by an ineligible person in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.713, subd. 1(b), 2(b) (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the officer violated his Fourth Amendment privacy rights by acting without a search warrant to observe firearms in his camper after he had been arrested on a probation violation and removed from the property. The appellate court ruled that under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement, the officer was in a lawful position to view the subject firearms in defendant's camper. Defendant argued that he should receive only one sentence for the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm because the four identical offenses for which he was convicted arose out of a single behavioral incident. The appellate court ruled that the trial court erred by imposing multiple sentences when the offenses arose out of the same behavioral incident. Because defendant was charged with more than one firearms offense, the firearms exception contained in Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.035, subd. 3 (2008), did not apply. Also, defendant's sentence was unconstitutional because the facts that supported his aggravated sentence were made without the aid of a jury. Defendant's sentence amounted to an unconstitutional upward departure without the aid of a sentencing jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentences on three convictions were vacated and remanded for resentencing, and the judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The district court fined defendant and imposed a jail sentence that it stayed subject to probation for two years. The State filed a motion to supplement the record, and defendant filed a motion to strike an affidavit from the State's appendix.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was disoriented and walked into traffic on a highway. When an officer approached, defendant became combative. The record regarding defendant's competency testing was confused by omissions and gaps. One physician found defendant to be competent, but she performed no psychological or cognitive tests. The court first held that a proffered affidavit of the State essentially created a record with hearsay testimony and did not modify or correct an existing record, under Minn. R. Civ. App. P. 110.05. The district court exceeded its discretion by proceeding to trial without making a competence or incompetence finding, as required by Minn. R. Crim. P. 20.01, subd. 2. The lack of any district court finding on the issue of competence rendered the trial infirm under the rule. Although the length of delay and defendant's consistency in asserting his request for a speedy trial favored a claim, the reason for the delay and prejudice to defendant weighed against reversal. The delay was caused primarily by the district court's effort to vindicate defendant's rights regarding competency.</SPAN></P>

The petitioner alleged more than a dozen deficiencies as the basis of his ineffective assistance claim. The appellate court ruled that none of the claims had merit. The petitioner argued his attorney coerced, manipulated, or intimidated him into waiving various hearings. Much of the communication was alleged to have occurred outside the record on appeal and was therefore unreviewable. Matters in the record revealed an experienced attorney offering his client advice but deferring to the client's decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When he was 18 years old, the offender was convicted for first-degree criminal sexual conduct for the assault of a 12-year-old girl with cerebral palsy and developmental and physical disorders. During sex-offender treatment, the offender revealed seven other sexual assaults. The supervisor at the program stated that the offender was not amenable to sex offender therapy outside a secure facility. The court found that sufficient evidence supported the commitment as an SDP because two examiners testified that the offender's disorders caused him to have inadequate control over his sexual impulses. Sufficient evidence also supported the district court's finding that he engaged in a course of harmful sexual conduct because the offender continued to engage in prohibited conduct during his incarceration and intense supervision. Finally, the offender presented a high risk to reoffend, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c(a)(3), if not placed in a secure facility because the offender never completed a treatment system and was an effective liar. The offender did not show that a less-restrictive treatment program was available, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.185, subd. 1 (2008).</SPAN></P>

He had a history of violent sexual behavior and the evidence indicated that appellant's community environment would continue to be stressful and that he would be in essentially the same context where he had demonstrated sexually inappropriate behavior previously. It was also unimpressive that appellant technically completed two residential sex offender treatments when he was incarcerated in the 1990s because he sexually re-offended on three occasions after participating in treatment.

The recipient contended that the decision was arbitrary and capricious because a hearing officer failed to consider his difficulty reading and completing paperwork, his poor health due to lung disease, his psychological issues, his very low income, and the real threat of homelessness. The court found that the hearing officer considered all mitigating factors before affirming the CDA's termination decision. At no time during the recipient's 10-month tenure did he report his employment to the CDA. The court found that the termination determination was supported by substantial evidence. The HUD regulations, under 24 C.F.R. &sect; 982.551(b)(2), (4) (2008), plainly required that any income increase was to be reported within ten days and that failure to do so could result in the termination of benefits.

The appellate court disagreed, finding that although the officer did not have official training to visually determine the speed of a vehicle, 39 miles per hour in a 30 miles per hour zone was enough of a difference that a person familiar with the area could gain the ability to discern the difference. Furthermore, the visual estimation was supported by the reading on the officer's radar unit. Thus, the officer had a reasonable, articulable basis to initiate a traffic stop. The evidence supported the district court's conclusion that a sufficient chain of custody was established and that tampering did not occur. Furthermore, the driver was unable to set forth any evidence that would have challenged the integrity of the urine sample. Contrary to the driver's assertion, Minn. Stat. &sect; 634.15 (2008) did not unconstitutionally interfere with the judicial functions of ascertaining the facts and applying the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sex offender challenged a judgment of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) that committed him as a sexually dangerous person (SDP) under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c (2006), arguing that the statute was void for vagueness and that his commitment violated due process and placed him in double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court rejected the sex offender's procedural due process argument. Even when treatment was problematic, the State's interest in the safety of others was no less legitimate and compelling. So long as civil commitment was programmed to provide treatment and periodic review, due process was provided. The sex offender's commitment did not place him in double jeopardy. If an individual otherwise met the requirements for involuntary civil commitment, the State was under no obligation to release that individual simply because the detention followed a period of incarceration. The sexually dangerous person act did not involve retribution and was remedial in nature; thus, it did not violate substantive due process rights. Further, Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c, (2006), was not void for vagueness. The meaning of the phrase &quot;adequate control&quot; was clear; an offender's history of harmful sexual conduct and a high likelihood of future dangerousness, coupled with a mental illness or dysfunction, would demonstrate that an offender had difficulty controlling his behavior.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving while impaired and test refusal; he was acquitted of the former charge and convicted of the latter. On review, the court held that the district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence of the breath test defendant at the jail because the test was expressly admissible under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.41, subd. 2 (2004), but that the error was harmless. While defendant contended that this evidence was relevant to whether the officer had probable cause to believe that defendant was driving while impaired and to arrest defendant, the evidence clearly demonstrated that the officer had probable cause to believe that defendant was driving while impaired because defendant admitted having consumed alcohol and failed field sobriety tests. The court further found that the district court committed plain error in allowing the State to inform the jury that defendant had been through the chemical testing procedure previously. Although defendant's familiarity with the process implied a prior DWI arrest, the error did not so prejudice defendant that he did not receive a fair trial because substantial evidence supported the conviction.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the applicant's proposed statement of the proceedings, indicated that she did not receive a letter indicating she had to provide pay stubs and did not understand why she had to provide them because the Agency had contracted her employer, who provided the information.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held first that defendant's trial counsel was not rendered ineffective by failing to move to suppress the evidence of defendant's refusal to submit to chemical testing because a motion to suppress the test-refusal evidence would have been denied. Although defendant did request an attorney, his subsequent behavior frustrated the testing process and constituted a retraction of that request and a refusal to take the test. Therefore, defendant's limited right to counsel at the time of testing was not violated, and trial counsel's failure to move to suppress the evidence on that basis did not constitute ineffective assistance. The court also held that there was no error in the addition of instructional language--&quot;or attempted to request the defendant to submit to a chemical test of his breath.&quot; Finally, plain error occurred in the failure to instruct the jury regarding the requirement that one of the four conditions in Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.51, subd. 1(b), had to be established and that the jury had to find that defendant had been read the implied-consent advisory, as required by Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.51, subd. 2.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient argued that Minn.

The patient also argued that the district court erred in concluding that he had engaged in a course of harmful sexual conduct, and erred in rejecting his proposed less-restrictive alternative. The appellate court ruled that the district court's finding that the patient engaged in a course of harmful sexual conduct as defined in Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 7a(a) (2006), was not clearly erroneous.
