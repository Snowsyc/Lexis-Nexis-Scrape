<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syracuse Noise Control Ordinance (Revised General Ordinances of City of Syracuse) &sect; 40-16 (b), which prohibits the creation of &quot;unnecessary noise&quot; emanating beyond 50 feet from a motor vehicle operated on a public highway, does not offend the constitutional void-for-vagueness doctrine of due process. The ordinance defines &quot;unnecessary noise&quot; based on an objective standard--specifically, &quot;a reasonable person of normal sensibilities&quot; (Syracuse Noise Control Ordinance &sect; 40-3 [u]). Additionally, section 40-16 (b) is tailored to a specific context--limiting the prohibition to creating &quot;unnecessary noise&quot; by playing a radio or similar device that can be heard at least 50 feet away when being operated in a motor vehicle on a public highway. What is usual noise in the operation of a car radio or other sound production device has become common knowledge and any ordinary motorist should have no difficulty in ascertaining whether the noise in question violates the applicable standard. Accordingly, section 40-16 (b) is sufficiently definite to put a person on notice that playing music which can be heard over 50 feet from such person's car on a public road, in a manner that would annoy or disturb a reasonable person of normal sensibilities, is forbidden conduct, and the objective standard affords police sufficiently clear standards for enforcement.</SPAN></P>

In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Court of Appeals held that a defendant who is not apprised of the PRS component is entitled to reversal of the conviction and automatic vacatur of the plea, and that the defendant is not required to demonstrate that he or she would not have pleaded guilty had he or she been aware of the PRS component. A prior conviction may not be counted for predicate felony purposes if it was obtained in violation of the defendant's rights as defined by the law at the time of the conviction. The law at the time of defendants' respective predicate convictions did not require automatic vacatur for a court's failure to pronounce PRS. Although the law required a defendant be informed of the direct consequences of a guilty plea, it also required that defects in plea allocutions could not result in a reversal absent a showing of prejudice. Both state and federal law required that a defendant demonstrate that he or she would not have pleaded guilty had he or she known about a mandatory term of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes--Vacatur of Judgment of Conviction--Failure to Apprise Defendant of Postrelease Supervision--Application of New Precedent Based on Federal Retroactivity Principles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Federal retroactivity principles did not warrant vacatur of defendants' predicate felony convictions based upon the subsequently issued decision of the Court of Appeals in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (4 NY3d 242, 825 NE2d 1081, 792 NYS2d 887 [2005]) on the ground that those convictions were unconstitutionally obtained because the court failed to apprise defendants of the postrelease supervision (PRS) component relative to the sentences imposed on their guilty pleas. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Court of Appeals held that a defendant who is not apprised of the PRS component is entitled to reversal of the conviction and automatic vacatur of the plea, and that the defendant is not required to demonstrate that he or she would not have pleaded guilty had he or she been aware of the PRS component. A prior conviction may not be used as a predicate conviction where it was obtained in violation of present law which is properly applied to it under recognized principles of retroactivity. Under federal rules, new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced. However, a new rule will be applied retroactively if it is a watershed rule of criminal procedure that implicates the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;automatic vacatur&quot; rule did not constitute such a &quot;watershed rule&quot; because it was not necessary to prevent an impermissibly large risk of an inaccurate conviction, and it was doubtful that the failure of the courts to apprise defendants of the PRS component resulted in them pleading guilty to crimes that they did not commit. Moreover, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not alter the understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes--Vacatur of Judgment of Conviction--Failure to Apprise Defendant of Postrelease Supervision--Application of New Precedent Based on State Retroactivity Principles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. State retroactivity principles did not support retroactive application of the decision of the Court of Appeals in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (4 NY3d 242, 825 NE2d 1081, 792 NYS2d 887 [2005]) to vacate defendants' predicate felony convictions on the ground that those convictions were unconstitutionally obtained because the court failed to ap prise defendants of the postrelease supervision (PRS) component relative to the sentences imposed on their guilty pleas. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Court of Appeals held that a defendant who is not apprised of the PRS component is entitled to reversal of the conviction and automatic vacatur of the plea, and that the defendant is not required to demonstrate that he or she would not have pleaded guilty had he or she been aware of the PRS component. In determining whether a new precedent should be afforded a retroactive application, courts should weigh the purpose to be served by the new standards, the extent of the reliance by law enforcement on the old standards and the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards. Although a court's failure to advise a pleading defendant of the PRS component constitutes a due process violation, it cannot be said that the purpose of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rule--automatic vacatur--has any bearing on the defendant's guilt or innocence. While PRS is an important component of a sentence, a court's failure to inform a defendant of that component is not likely to result in the conviction of an innocent person. Moreover, prosecutors, defense counsel and courts had relied extensively on the legitimacy of pre-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> predicate felony convictions for enhancement purposes where PRS had not been pronounced, and retroactive application of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would do little to advance the administration of justice as it would render useless prior predicate convictions as a result of a sentencing error that bore no relationship to the defendant's guilt or innocence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-Counties' challenge to the constitutionality of L 2012, ch. 56, &sect; 1, part D, &sect; 61 lacked merit with respect to a dispute regarding the counties' demand for payment after the State Legislature restructured the Medicaid local-share payment system and enacted a flat cap on total county Medicaid expenses, as assuming that the counties had a vested right to reimbursements that accrued prior to 2006, &sect; 61 terminated the submission of pre-2006 claims past its effective date; [2]-Moreover, procedural due process did not mandate that &sect; 61 be extended beyond its effective date in order to protect counties' vested rights in unpaid funds because the counties had an opportunity to pursue claims before enactment of the statutory prohibition on submissions based on Social Services Law &sect; 368-a(1)(h)(i) and their knowledge of the ensuing prohibition under &sect; 61.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- Medicaid Reimbursement Payments -- Medicaid Cap </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Constitutionality of Amendment Imposing Time Limit on Claims for Overburden Reimbursements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A 2012 amendment (L 2012, ch 56, &sect; 1, part D, &sect; 61&nbsp;[section 61]) to the Medicaid Cap Statute (L 2005, ch 58, &sect; 1, part C, &sect; 1), which provided that no overburden reimbursement (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Social Services Law &sect; 368-a [1] [h]) for social services district expenditures incurred prior to January 1, 2006 would be made for claims submitted on and after April 1, 2012, was constitutional. Acts of the legislature are entitled to a strong presumption of constitutionality, which can only be overcome when it can be shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the act conflicts with a fundamental law, and reconciliation of the statute with the constitution has been found to be impossible. Here, even if petitioner counties, as social services districts, had a vested right to any reimbursements that accrued before 2006, section 61 was constitutional under any possible theory presented. The legislatively-mandated cutoff date for submission of pre-2006 claims was a response to judicial misinterpretations of prior statutory efforts to end the claims process, which was administratively instituted by the New York State Department of Health under the State's former Medicaid allocation regime. Once the State complied with its statutory obligation under Social Services Law &sect; 368-a (1) (h) (i) to pay the counties for overburden reimbursements, it was fully consistent with the prior mandatory reimbursement scheme for the legislature to impose a deadline on claims for unpaid funds. That deadline was not in conflict with a fundamental law or constitutional principles. Just as the counties could not be heard to complain that the legislature replaced one Medicaid allocation scheme with another, thus redefining the counties' expense burden, so too were they without recourse when the legislature imposed a deadline on their submission of claims for overburden reimbursements, thereby closing the door on pre-2006 claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- Medicaid Reimbursement Payments -- Medicaid Cap </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Constitutionality of Amendment Imposing Time Limit on Claims for Overburden Reimbursements -- Procedural Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Procedural due process did not mandate extension of the April 1, 2012 deadline for petitioner counties, as social services districts, to submit claims for Medicaid overburden reimbursements (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Social Services Law &sect; 368-a [1] [h]) for district expenditures incurred prior to January 1, 2006, as imposed by an amendment (L 2012, ch 56, &sect; 1, part D, &sect; 61&nbsp;[section 61]) to the Medicaid Cap Statute (L 2005, ch 58, &sect; 1, part C, &sect; 1), to protect the counties' vested rights in any unpaid funds. Procedural due process guarantees notice and an opportunity to be heard before a claimant is deprived of liberty or a recognized property interest. As far back as 1988, the counties were on notice under the prior Medicaid allocation scheme that the State was obligated to pay overburden reimbursements and that the counties could pursue claims for amounts still owed after payment. The counties knew on a weekly basis the amount the State was taking to satisfy their local share of Medicaid expenses, and the State provided quarterly reports by which the counties could determine if they had a potential claim. After the enactment of the Medicaid Cap Statute, when the State began categorically rejecting claims submitted after 2006, almost a decade of litigation ensued and resulted in the eventual payment of all outstanding claims. Thereafter, the counties continued to submit more claims as the effective date of section 61 approached. Thus, it could not be said that the counties did not have notice of the claims process or an opportunity to seek reimbursement for claims, including those going back over 20 years. The counties had no claim to the continuation of the former overburden reimbursement system in perpetuity because the State acted well within its authority to reallocate Medicaid spending under the Medicaid Cap Statute, which provided significant benefits to the counties. Moreover, the deadline furthered the State's significant interest in the stability of its finances and the budgeting process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Mandamus -- When Remedy Available -- State's Payment of Medicaid Overburden Reimbursements to Counties</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner counties, as social services districts, were not entitled to mandamus relief requiring the New York State Department of Health (DOH) to pay all claims for Medicaid overburden reimbursement (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Social Services Law &sect; 368-a [1] [h]) for district expenditures incurred prior to January 1, 2006, which were submitted after the April 1, 2012 deadline for such claims as imposed by an amendment (L 2012, ch 56, &sect; 1, part D, &sect; 61&nbsp;[section 61]) to the Medicaid Cap Statute (L 2005, ch 58, &sect; 1, part C, &sect; 1). Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy which is used to enforce an administrative act positively required to be done by a provision of law. Here, DOH made its initial determinations and reimbursed counties quarterly, and then paid out all claims submitted prior to the deadline. The Social Services Law required no more. Inasmuch as section 61 was deemed constitutional, ordering mandamus would be inconsistent with that conclusion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Alison D. v Virginia M.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (77 NY2d 651, 572 NE2d 27, 569 NYS2d 586 [1991]), which held that, in an unmarried couple, a partner without a biological or adoptive relation to a child is not the child's &quot;parent&quot; for purposes of standing to seek custody or visitation under the statute, notwithstanding their established relationship with the child, is overruled. In light of more recently delineated legal principles, including conferring parental standing based on equity in the context of adoption and support proceedings and the enactment of same-sex marriage in New York, the narrow definition of &quot;parent&quot; established in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Alison D.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had become unworkable when applied to increasingly varied familial relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent, Child and Family</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Custody -- Standing of Non-Biological, Non-Adoptive Parent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Where, in an unmarried couple, a partner without a biological or adoptive relation to a child proves by clear and convincing evidence that he or she agreed with the biological parent of the child to conceive and raise the child as co-parents, the non-biological, non-adoptive partner has standing to seek visitation and custody as the child's &quot;parent&quot; under Domestic Relations Law &sect; 70 (a). Accordingly, in separate Family Court Act article 6 proceedings where each petitioner--the non-biological, non-adoptive partner--alleged that she entered into a pre-conception agreement with the respondent biological parent to conceive and raise a child as co-parents, the allegations, if proved by clear and convincing evidence, were sufficient to establish petitioners' standing to seek custody and visitation under the statute. Because both cases were necessarily decided based on the facts presented, it would be premature to consider adopting a test for situations in which a couple did not enter into a pre-conception agreement. Additionally, the ultimate determination of whether the custody or visitation rights sought by the non-biological, non-adoptive parent should be granted rested in the sound discretion of the court, which determines the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent, Child and Family</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Custody -- Standing of Non-Biological, Non-Adoptive Parent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a Family Court Act article 6 proceeding brought by the partner in an unmarried couple without a biological or adoptive relation to the other partner's biological child, the Appellate Division order affirming Family Court's dismissal of the petition on constraint of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Alison D. v Virginia M.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (77 NY2d 651, 572 NE2d 27, 569 NYS2d 586 [1991]) was reversed and the matter remitted to Family Court for further proceedings, as that decision has been overruled and no longer prevents the courts below from determining standing. Where, in an unmarried couple, a partner without a biological or adoptive relation to a child proves by clear and convincing evidence that he or she agreed with the biological parent of the child to conceive and raise the child as co-parents, the non-biological, non-adoptive partner has standing to seek visitation and custody as the child's &quot;parent&quot; under Domestic Relations Law &sect; 70 (a). Accordingly, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Alison D.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> no longer poses any obstacle to the consideration by the courts below of standing by equitable estoppel if petitioner proves by clear and convincing evidence her allegation that a pre-conception agreement existed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a Family Court Act article 6 proceeding brought by the partner in an unmarried couple who did not have a biological or adoptive relation to the other partner's biological child but had been ordered to pay child support, the courts below correctly resolved the question of standing by recognizing petitioner's standing to seek visitation as a &quot;parent&quot; under Domestic Relations Law &sect; 70 (a) based on judicial estoppel. Respondent had obtained an order in the child support proceeding between the parties based on her successful argument that petitioner was a parent to the child, and was therefore estopped from taking the inconsistent position that petitioner was not, in fact, a parent to the child for purposes of visitation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive Law &sect; 552 (2) (c), which provides that a special prosecutor employed pursuant to the Protection of People with Special Needs Act (Executive Law art 20) to protect &quot;vulnerable persons&quot; as defined in Executive Law &sect; 550 (5) &quot;may, after consultation with the district attorney . . . attend in person&quot; any county or supreme court or grand jury proceeding for the purpose of prosecuting abuse and neglect crimes committed against such persons, does not prohibit the special prosecutor from prosecuting abuse and neglect cases in local criminal courts. Accordingly, Town Court erred in dismissing the charges against defendant employee of a residential center arising out of an alleged incident with a resident on the ground that the special prosecutor lacked authority to prosecute offenses in local criminal courts. There is no indication from the statute that the special prosecutor's powers are limited by section 552 (2) (c). That section merely sets forth the requirement that the special prosecutor consult with the district attorney of the pertinent county should he or she wish to appear in County Court or Supreme Court, or before the grand jury, for purposes of managing or conducting before such court or grand jury a criminal action or proceeding involving the abuse or neglect of a vulnerable person. There is no indication that the statute governs proceedings in local courts at all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs, current and retired judges and justices of the New York court system who served without any increased compensation during a period in which the legislature and Governor engaged in the unconstitutional practice of linkage, whereby consideration of judicial compensation was tied to unrelated policy initiatives, were not entitled to an award of money damages in the amount of the pay raises they believed they would have received had the linkage not taken place. While the failure to consider judicial compensation on the merits violated the separation of powers doctrine, defendants did not also violate the separation of powers doctrine by refusing to increase judicial salaries during the years in which they had engaged in the practice of linkage. Therefore, plaintiffs could not obtain retroactive monetary relief as compensation for defendants' failure to grant plaintiffs raises to which they were not constitutionally entitled. Moreover, money damages would be an inappropriate form of relief from defendants' unconstitutional linkage practice because any mandate that the State pay money damages would be tantamount to a directive to increase judicial compensation in a manner that would arrogate the legislative branch's budgetary powers to the judiciary. Even assuming that the articles of the State Constitution that establish the separation of powers doctrine are self-executing provisions that can support an individual claim for money damages, defendants' particular violation of the doctrine did not meet the remaining typical prerequisites for a damages award.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A tenured teacher who resigns, and later seeks to return as a tenured teacher, must strictly comply with New York City Board of Education Chancellor's Regulation C-205 (29), which provides that a tenured teacher who resigns &quot;shall . . . remain tenured and, upon written request, be permitted to withdraw such resignation subject only to medical examination and the approval of the Chancellor.&quot; Accordingly, petitioner, a former tenured school teacher who resigned from teaching and was subsequently hired to teach at another school, was not automatically entitled to tenure in his new position because he did not submit a written request to withdraw his resignation and therefore failed to comply with the requirements of C-205 (29). By its very terms, C-205 (29) requires submission of a written request for withdrawal of resignation prior to a teacher's reinstatement with tenure. If post-resignation application and hiring alone were sufficient to withdraw a prior resignation, then the language of the regulation requiring &quot;written request . . . subject only to medical examination and the approval of the Chancellor,&quot; would have no meaning. C-205 (29)'s provision that a written request be subject to the Chancellor's approval gives the Chancellor the opportunity to reject a request to withdraw a resignation. Otherwise, the Chancellor's role in the process would be entirely eliminated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not violated by the People's introduction into evidence at trial of excerpts from telephone conversations that defendant had with friends and family during his pretrial detention, which were recorded and made available to the District Attorney's Office in accordance with the New York City Department of Correction's policy and practice of monitoring inmates' telephone calls and releasing the recordings, upon request, to city prosecutors. Though the Sixth Amendment right to counsel prohibits the use of incriminating statements deliberately elicited by government agents from a defendant without the assistance of counsel, the Department did not serve as an agent of the State when it recorded the calls it turned over to the District Attorney's Office, and defendant was not induced by any promise, or coerced by the Department, to call friends and family and make statements detrimental to his defense. Nothing in the record suggested that the Department solicited, elicited, encouraged or provoked the conversations, and defendant made the telephone calls aware that he was being recorded. The mere act of recording is no different from an informer sitting mute, not provoking or prompting conversation but merely listening to a statement freely made, and such an informer is not, as a matter of law, an agent of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Evidence -- Tape Recordings -- Telephone Calls Made by Defendant from Correctional Facility -- Regulatory Violation Implicating Constitutional Right</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant failed to identify a statutory right violated by the New York City Department of Correction that would justify the suppression of excerpts from telephone conversations that he had with friends and family during his pretrial detention, which were recorded and made available to the District Attorney's Office in accordance with the Department's policy and practice of monitoring inmates' telephone calls and releasing the recordings, upon request, to city prosecutors. Though suppression of evidence is warranted when the violation of a statute implicating a constitutionally protected right leads thereto, defendant relied on 40 RCNY 1-10 (h) to argue that the Department acted beyond the scope of its authority. Even if a regulatory violation implicating a constitutionally protected right could justify suppression, 40 RCNY 1-10 (h)--authorizing the Department to listen to and monitor all inmate calls not otherwise exempted or privileged--specifically provides that inmate telephone calls with attorneys &quot;shall not be listened to or monitored.&quot; Thus, 40 RCNY 1-10 (h) only implicates the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to the extent that it guards against violations of privileged attorney-client communications. It does not prohibit the Department's supervision over inmates' telephone conversations with friends and families involving non-privileged matters, such as the calls at issue in defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant's claim that he did not consent to the New York City Department of Correction's dissemination to the District Attorney's Office of recorded telephone conversations that he had with friends and family during his pretrial detention was unpreserved. Though defendant argued on appeal that his consent could not be implied because he was never informed that the recordings might be released to the prosecutor, he failed to argue to the trial court that his consent could not be broader than the recording notice that was provided to him by the Department.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (OPRHP)--the administrative agency charged with &quot;[o]perat[ing] and maintain[ing]&quot; state parks, historic sites, beaches and other recreational facilities (PRHPL 3.09 [2]) and &quot;[p]rovid[ing] for the health, safety and welfare of the public using facilities under its jurisdiction&quot; (PRHPL 3.09 [5])--acted within the confines of the authority delegated to it by the legislature in enacting 9 NYCRR 386.1--prohibiting smoking in certain outdoor locations under OPRHP's jurisdiction. Thus, in a combined proceeding and action commenced by petitioner nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting the interests of smokers, the Appellate Division correctly ruled that OPRHP's adoption of 9 NYCRR 386.1 was not in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. Reviewing the factors relevant to a determination of whether agency rulemaking has exceeded legislative fiat, whether OPRHP gave undue weight to policy considerations in adopting the regulation was not considered as improperly raised for the first time on appeal. Turning to the merits of the remaining factors, and considering them together, the legislature made the policy decision to limit smoking in certain areas of the state and left it to state agencies to act within the confines of its determination, and 9 NYCRR 386.1 merely filled in details of that legislative policy. Further, though the legislature had considered and rejected bills relating to outdoor smoking restrictions, it could have declined to act in part because it already delegated to OPRHP the authority to designate such no-smoking areas. Finally, OPRHP was experienced in the functions of the parks and like properties under its purview, and 9 NYCRR 386.1 was driven by several concerns that were within the realm of OPRHP's expertise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was required to preserve her objection to the trial court's procedure of discharging potential jurors on hardship grounds without conducting an inquiry into the particular hardship and instead directing them to speak with the court clerk, as such procedure did not constitute a mode of proceedings error that deprived defendant of her right to a jury trial under the supervision of a judge. Once formal voir dire is commenced, the defendant has a fundamental right to have it overseen by a judge. Formal voir dire had not commenced when the court inquired of the prospective jurors as to whether they had any hardship. The trial court asked the prospective jurors--none of whom had their names drawn or were called to the jury box--if they believed that they would be unable to serve because of a hardship. At that point, there had been no inquiry into whether those particular prospective jurors were fit to serve as fair and impartial jurors. A defendant does not possess a &quot;fundamental right&quot; to have a judge oversee whether a prospective juror has issues in his or her life that prevent him or her from sitting. Nor could it be said that the trial court &quot;delegated&quot; an exclusive judicial function to the clerk, as Judiciary Law &sect; 517 (c) grants to the commissioner of jurors or the court the authority to &quot;consider whether ... there is any ... fact [which] indicates that attendance for jury service ... would cause undue hardship or extreme inconvenience.&quot; At most, the trial court failed to adhere to a statutory procedural protection; it did not relieve defendant of her obligation to object to the court's procedure.</SPAN></P>

The trial court in defendant's burglary and assault prosecution did not abuse its discretion when it precluded defendant from introducing evidence that she claimed demonstrated that people other than defendant committed the crimes. Defendant had sought to introduce testimony from a witness who was expected to testify that 10 days prior to the burglary and assault, two men approached defendant and the witness. One of the men purportedly told them that the victim's boyfriend, who was also the father of defendant's two children, had beat him up for &quot;kilograms,&quot; and that it must have been the victim who had &quot;set [him] up to be robbed by&quot; her boyfriend. The men also said, &quot;look, [the victim's boyfriend] stole our narcotics, we can't get at [him], because [he] [i]s in jail ... , but we can get at you.&quot; The trial court refused to allow the testimony, finding it to be hearsay, not probative and too speculative to demonstrate that the two men were involved in the attack. Before a trial court permits evidence that another party committed the crime for which a defendant is on trial, the court must balance the probity of the evidence against the prejudicial effect to the People. The admission of such evidence may not rest on mere suspicion or surmise. Here, it could not be said that the trial court abused its discretion in not allowing the proffered testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Counsel -- Effective Representation -- Failure to Object to Prosecutor's Comments during Summation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel in her prosecution for burglary and assault by her trial counsel's failure to object to comments by the prosecutor on summation that appealed to gender bias and denigrated defendant's alibi defense. The court interrupted the prosecutor after he made the allegation that certain defense witnesses had not come forward until the day before. The court explained that defendant had served notice of the alibi defense prior to trial, the People were not surprised when the alibi witnesses testified on defendant's behalf, defense counsel was not required to mention the alibi witnesses during his opening, and that defendant was not required to present any evidence at trial. The court's curative instruction--which it gave on its own volition--alleviated any prejudice to defendant and conveyed to the jury that the alibi witnesses did not come forward at the last minute. Moreover, the prosecutor's statements that &quot;[o]nly a woman would inflict this kind of beating,&quot; &quot;[t]his crime is a woman&quot; and &quot;hell have [sic] no fury as a woman's scorn [sic]&quot; were inflammatory and improper summation, but defense counsel's failure to object to them did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel such that a new trial was required. The remarks were so over the top and ridiculous that defense counsel may have made a strategic decision not to object out of reasonable belief that the jury would be alienated by the prosecutor's boorish comments. Defense counsel presented an alibi defense, attacked the credibility of the People's witnesses, sought to introduce third-party culpability evidence, and pointed out the lack of forensic evidence tying defendant to the crime. Thus, it could not be said that defendant did not receive meaningful representation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a criminal prosecution in which defendant agreed to a plea deal which included treating him as a second felony offender based on a prior out-of-state conviction, defendant did not waive his argument that the prior conviction was not equivalent to a New York felony, notwithstanding that he did not challenge the predicate felony after the plea colloquy during which he was advised only that he could challenge it on the grounds that he was either not the person named or that the conviction was unconstitutionally obtained.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a criminal prosecution in which defendant agreed to a plea deal which included treating him as a second felony offender based on a prior out- of-state conviction, defendant's argument that the prior conviction was not equivalent to any New York felony was preserved for review inasmuch as it was raised in his CPL 440.20 motion to set aside his sentence. A CPL 440.20 motion is the proper vehicle for raising a challenge to a sentence as unauthorized, illegally imposed or otherwise invalid as a matter of law, and a determination of second felony offender status is an aspect of the sentence. Raising the predicate felony sentencing issue in a CPL 440.20 motion serves the goals and purposes of the preservation rule by permitting the parties to present their arguments on the issue in the trial court, creating a record for appellate review, and allowing the trial court the first opportunity to correct any error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Second Felony Offender -- Prior Out-of-State Conviction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a criminal prosecution in which defendant pleaded guilty to first-degree robbery and was sentenced as a second felony offender based on a prior Washington, D.C. conviction for attempt to commit robbery, the prior out-of-state conviction was not a proper basis for the predicate felony offender adjudication. A prior out-of-state conviction qualifies as a predicate felony conviction if it involved an offense which is the equivalent of a New York felony (Penal Law &sect; 70.06 [1] [b] [i]). Courts generally should consider only the statutes defining the relevant crimes, but courts must consider the underlying allegations when the foreign statute renders criminal several different acts, some of which would constitute felonies and others of which would constitute only misdemeanors or no crime if committed in New York. The analysis requires the court to distinguish between the specific criminal acts required by the penal statute and the various ways in which the statutory crime may be committed. Here, the Washington, D.C. statute provided that, &quot;[w]hoever by force or violence, whether against resistance or by sudden or stealthy seizure or snatching, or by putting in fear, shall take from the person or immediate actual possession of another anything of value, is guilty of robbery&quot; (DC Code &sect; 22-2801). A taking &quot;by sudden or stealthy seizure or snatching&quot; would not be considered a robbery or other felony in New York. The Washington, D.C. crime can be committed in different ways and the phrase &quot;sudden or stealthy seizure or snatching&quot; does not describe separate criminal acts required by the statute in addition to the use of &quot;force or violence.&quot; Thus, the statute indicates that a person can be convicted of the foreign crime without committing an act that would qualify as a felony in New York.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-As a child had lived with his paternal grandparents from infancy until he was almost 10, and his mother signed over virtually all decision-making rights to them, they had standing to seek custody under Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72(2) based on extraordinary circumstances, even though the child had contact with, and spent time with, his mother while the child lived with the grandparents; [2]-The intermediate appellate court erred in dismissing the grandparents' action on the basis that they failed to demonstrate &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; due to the mother's presence in the child's life, as &quot;extended disruption of custody&quot; under &sect; 72(2) did not mean that the parent did not have had any contact, or at least any significant contact, with the child for at least 24 months; the quality and quantity of contact between the parent and child were simply factors to be considered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent, Child and Family -- Custody -- Grandparents' Standing Based on Extended Disruption of Custody -- Parent-Child Contact during Child's Residence with Grandparents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Grandparents may demonstrate standing to seek custody based on extraordinary circumstances where the child has lived with the grandparents for a prolonged period of time, even if the child had contact with, and spent time with, a parent while the child lived with the grandparents. Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72 (2) does not create new rights for grandparents, but clarifies a method by which grandparents may exercise those rights, and defines an alternative type of extraordinary circumstance applicable only to grandparents--specifically, an extended disruption of custody--in view of their special status. There is no explicit statutory reference to contact or the lack thereof between the parent and child. Rather, the quality and quantity of contact are factors to be considered in the context of the totality of the circumstances when determining whether the parent voluntarily relinquished care and control of the child, and whether the child actually resided with the grandparents for the required &quot;prolonged&quot; period of time. To give meaning to the separate statutory avenue of establishing standing, Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72 (2) must be available for a grandparent even if the parent has had some contact with the child during the requisite 24-month period. To hold otherwise would not only conflict with the legislature's intent, but would also deter grandparents from promoting a relationship between the parent and the child while the child resides with them, contrary to this state's public policy of encouraging and strengthening parent-child relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent, Child and Family -- Custody -- Grandparents' Standing Based on Extraordinary Circumstances -- Extended Disruption of Mother's Custody</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Petitioner grandparents established their standing to seek custody of respondent mother's child, who began living with petitioners within days of his birth and for nearly 10 years thereafter, by demonstrating the extraordinary circumstance of an extended disruption of respondent's custody. Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72 (2) sets forth three &quot;elements&quot; required to demonstrate the extraordinary circumstance of an &quot;extended disruption of custody&quot;: a 24-month separation of the parent and child, which is identified as &quot;prolonged&quot;; the parent's voluntary relinquishment of care and control of the child during such period; and the residence of the child in the grandparents' household. In signing three documents, each giving petitioners permission to make decisions regarding the child, respondent freely signed over virtually all decision-making rights indefinitely--she did not limit the permission to times when she was unavailable--demonstrating her intent that petitioners permanently assume the parental responsibility of caring for the child. Respondent could have expressly revoked or limited her written permission, but she never did so. The evidence therefore supported Family Court's finding that respondent voluntarily relinquished care and control of the child for more than 24 months, even though she had regular contact and visitation with him. Respondent allowed petitioners to assume control over, and responsibility for the care of, the child while he resided with them for a prolonged period of years, during which she assumed the role of a noncustodial parent in virtually every way. As respondent effectively transferred custody of the child to petitioners for a prolonged period of time, the circumstances rose to the level of extraordinary.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, defendant could not be convicted of manslaughter in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 125.05 [1]) for the death of her child six days after being delivered by an emergency caesarean section following defendant's motor vehicle accident, which allegedly occurred because defendant, driving under the influence of a prescription drug and alcohol, without a seat belt and more than 20 miles per hour in excess of the speed limit, entered the oncoming lane of traffic and hit another car head on, causing injury to defendant's 34-week-old fetus. In enacting Penal Law &sect; 125.05 (1), which defines a person as &quot;a human being who has been born and is alive,&quot; and Penal Law &sect; 125.15 (1), which defines second-degree manslaughter as recklessly causing the death of another &quot;person,&quot; the legislature did not intend to hold pregnant women criminally responsible for conduct with respect to themselves and their unborn fetuses unless such conduct is done intentionally. Where the legislature has decided to criminalize a pregnant woman's conduct toward her unborn fetus, it has clearly established statutory prohibitions against such conduct and has determined that the punishment for intentional conduct is no greater than a misdemeanor. The legislature did not intend to impose greater punishment on pregnant women for their alleged reckless conduct toward a fetus than for their intentional conduct. Moreover, had defendant not consented to the caesarean section and her fetus died </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">in utero</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, she could not have been prosecuted under the manslaughter statute because the fetus would not have fallen under the definition of a &quot;person.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Tax Law &sect; 1105 (b) (2) unambiguously imposes a tax on all voice services sold for a fixed periodic charge, including interstate and international calls, and is not preempted by the Federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act (MTSA) (4 USC &sect; 116 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">). The MTSA establishes a uniform &quot;sourcing&quot; rule for state taxation of mobile telecommunications services: the only state that may impose a tax is the state of the customer's place of primary use. The MTSA bundling provision expressly opens by respecting and incorporating state authority, rather than restricting it, and anticipates disaggregation only of charges &quot;not otherwise subject . . . to [state] taxation.&quot; Because the Tax Law imposes a tax on the entire amount of the fixed monthly charge for voice services, there is no exemption for any interstate and international component that would trigger section 123 (b)'s exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Sales and Use Taxes -- Knowingly Making False Statements Material to Sales Tax Obligation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

The complaint contained allegations about agency guidance and industry compliance with the Attorney General's position that Tax Law &sect; 1105 (b) (2) requires the payment of sales taxes on the full amount of fixed periodic charges for wireless voice services, defendant's prior payment of the proper amount of sales tax and its undisclosed reversal of its practices, and explicit warnings that defendant received from the state tax department that defendant's sales tax practice was illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Ex Post Facto Law -- New York False Claims Act</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Retroactive application of the New York False Claims Act (FCA) (State Finance Law &sect; 187 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) to impose damages and civil penalties against defendant wireless telecommunications service provider for &quot;knowingly mak[ing] . . . a false record or statement material to&quot; its obligation to pay sales tax with respect to the portion of its flat-rate monthly charge arbitrarily allocated to interstate and international calls (State Finance Law &sect; 189 [1] [g]) was not barred by the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution (US Const, art I, &sect; 10). The penalty scheme does not impose an affirmative disability or restraint, and monetary penalties like those imposed by the FCA have not historically been viewed as punishment. Also, the FCA does not regulate conduct that was already a crime, and the penalty scheme may be rationally connected to the nonpunitive purposes of allowing the government to be made whole. Finally, given the compensatory, nonpunitive aims of the statute, the penalties are not unduly excessive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a declaratory judgment action arising out of a challenge by plaintiff nonresident shareholders in an out-of-state S corporation to an income tax assessed on their pro rata share of gains from a sale of the corporation's stock that the parties to the sale elected to treat as a &quot;deemed asset sale&quot; for tax purposes under Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) &sect; 338 (h) (10), the tax--properly assessed pursuant to Tax Law &sect; 632 (a) (2), as amended, on the portion of plaintiffs' gains derived from or connected with New York sources--did not fall within the prohibition contained in New York Constitution, article XVI, &sect; 3. While the plain language of section 3 precludes taxation of nonresidents' intangible personal property based on physical ownership, possession or presence in New York State, the tax was not by definition or application an ad valorem tax assessed based on ownership and imposed according to value, nor was it an excise tax levied solely because of ownership or possession. Instead, the tax was based on income generated by those intangibles that were derived from New York sources. The text of section 3 makes no mention and provides no language supporting extending the prohibition on ad valorem and ownership/property-based excise taxes to income taxes, and there is simply no language in section 3 that expressly or implicitly constrains the State from imposing any other non-location-based taxes. Historical examination of section 3's drafting and review likewise revealed that its intent was to prohibit taxation of intangible assets based merely on their physical presence within the state, and to ensure a proscription on the ad valorem taxation system as applied to intangible personal property, but that the prohibition did not eliminate all taxation. </SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-The record was devoid of evidence to support the taxpayers' claim that New York had a long-established policy of not taxing the gain recognized by nonresident S corporation shareholders in connection with installment payment obligations distributed pursuant to 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 453(h)(1)(A) in a deemed asset sale under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 338(h)(10); [2]-Given the curative purposes, the extension of retroactive application of the statute to only those tax years for which any taxpayers could seek a refund, and the lack of justifiable reliance by the taxpayers on prior law, the retroactivity period was not excessive, arbitrary, or irrational.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Retroactive Application of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Change to Tax Law -- Due Process Violation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The retroactive application of amendments to Tax Law &sect; 632 (a) (2)--which sought to correct an administrative error and to prevent both an unexpected loss of revenue and confusion in return preparation by S corporation purchasers--to tax income received from the deemed asset sale of nonresident plaintiffs' shares in an S corporation 3&frac12; years earlier did not violate plaintiffs' due process rights under the United States and New York State Constitutions. A retroactive tax violates due process only if it is so harsh and oppressive as to transgress the constitutional limitation. In analyzing whether a statute is harsh and oppressive, and, thus, arbitrary and irrational, the Court uses a balancing-of-equities test, considering the taxpayer's forewarning of a change in the legislation and the reasonableness of reliance on the old law, the length of the retroactive period and the public purpose for retroactive application. Plaintiffs failed to show reasonable reliance on their interpretation of the pre-amendment version of Tax Law &sect; 632 (a) (2), given legislative findings that similar interpretations altered a long-standing, contrary policy in effect at the time of the taxable transaction, as well as the curative purpose of the retroactive amendments, which expressly were meant to cure an unintended administrative error. Moreover, the purposes of the amendments were curative and the period of retroactivity was rationally related thereto, and attempting to correct an error and preventing significant and unanticipated revenue loss are rational public purposes underlying retroactivity. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Preemption by State -- Regulation of Attorney Conduct </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local Law No. 15 (2009) of City of New York, to the extent it purports to regulate attorneys acting in a debt collecting capacity in governing the conduct of debt collection agencies, is not preempted by Judiciary Law &sect;&sect; 53 and 90, which confer broad authority upon the courts to regulate the practice of law. A local law will be preempted either where there is a direct conflict with a state statute (conflict preemption) or where the legislature has indicated its intent to occupy the particular field (field preemption). Local laws are inconsistent where they prohibit what would be permissible under state law, or impose prerequisite additional restrictions on rights under state law, so as to inhibit the operation of the state's general laws. Although attorneys that are acting in a debt collecting capacity may fall within the penumbra of Local Law 15, it does not purport to regulate attorneys as such. There is no express conflict between the broad authority accorded to the courts to regulate attorneys under the Judiciary Law and the licensing of individuals as attorneys who are engaged in debt collection activity falling outside the practice of law and, thus, the local law does not impose an additional requirement for attorneys to practice law. Rather, the regulatory schemes are complementary to, and compatible with, one another. Moreover, the courts' authority to regulate attorney conduct does not evince an intent to preempt the field of regulating nonlegal services rendered by attorneys. To the extent that the courts have exercised some authority over such services, the regulation in that area is not so detailed and comprehensive as to imply that the field has been preempted.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree arising after defendant sold crack cocaine to an undercover police officer, the People were required by CPL 710.30 to give defendant pretrial notice of their intention to offer at trial the testimony of a detective who surveyed the drug transaction and, after defendant was apprehended and arrested, identified defendant as the person he had observed with the undercover officer. The detective's surveillance of defendant did not constitute an observation of him that was so clear that the identification could not be mistaken, thereby obviating the risk of undue suggestiveness. When the People intend to offer at trial &quot;testimony regarding an observation of the defendant either at the time or place of the commission of the offense or upon some other occasion relevant to the case, to be given by a witness who has previously identified him as such,&quot; the statute requires them to notify the defense of such intention within 15 days after arraignment and before trial (CPL 710.30 [1] [b]). The statute was a legislative response to the problem of suggestive and misleading pretrial identification procedures, and it contemplates pretrial resolution of the admissibility of identification testimony where it is alleged that an improper procedure occurred. As the People here failed to abide by the statutory notice requirement, the trial court erred in allowing the detective to testify at trial relative to his identification of defendant.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree arising after defendant sold crack cocaine to an undercover police officer, the trial court committed harmless error in allowing the People, who had provided CPL 710.30 notice with respect to the pretrial identification of defendant by the undercover officer but not the detective who surveyed the drug transaction and confirmed with the arresting officer that defendant was the person he had observed with the undercover officer, to offer the detective's identification testimony at trial. Even in the absence of the detective's identification testimony, the evidence at trial overwhelmingly established that defendant was the seller. The undercover officer, an experienced narcotics detective who engaged in a face-to-face transaction with defendant, unequivocally identified defendant as the seller. Moreover, defendant was arrested just minutes after the transaction, and the prerecorded buy money that had been used by the undercover officer to purchase the drugs was found on defendant's person. Finally, defendant's flight from police officers evinced a consciousness of guilt. Under the circumstances, the detective's testimony was merely cumulative, and its admission could not have contributed to defendant's conviction. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judiciary Law &sect; 470, which provides that an attorney admitted to practice in New York &quot;whose office for the transaction of law business is within the state&quot; may practice law within the state &quot;although he [or she] resides in an adjoining state,&quot; requires nonresident attorneys to maintain a physical law office in New York. The statute appears to presuppose a residency requirement for the practice of law in New York State. It then makes an exception, by allowing nonresident attorneys to practice law if they keep an &quot;office for the transaction of law business&quot; in New York. By its plain terms, then, the statute requires nonresident attorneys practicing in New York to maintain a physical law office here. Even if one wanted to interpret the term &quot;office&quot; loosely to mean someplace that an attorney can receive service, the additional phrase &quot;for the transaction of law business&quot; makes that interpretation less plausible. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant's 1991 convictions for two federal felonies that did not have New York counterparts were properly relied on in adjudicating him a persistent felony offender for purposes of sentencing on his 2007 felony conviction. A persistent felony offender is a person who stands convicted of a felony after having previously been convicted of two or more felonies (Penal Law &sect; 70.10 [1] [a]). Under Penal Law &sect; 70.10 (1) (b), a previous felony conviction includes &quot;a conviction of a felony in this state, or of a crime in any other jurisdiction.&quot; Unlike New York's second felony offender statute (Penal Law &sect; 70.06), the persistent felony offender statute, by its plain terms, does not require that, in order to classify someone as a persistent felony offender, an out-of-state predicate felony must have a New York counterpart. Section 70.10's silence with regard to New York equivalency is dispositive. Further, section 70.10's legislative history shows that the New York equivalency test was explicitly considered and rejected at the time of the statute's enactment. </SPAN></P>

Section 57A-11 deals only with signs posted on public property, a discrete regulatory topic and regime, the purpose and focus of which is entirely on the unique problems posed by signs on public right-of-ways.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judgment creditor's service of a CPLR 5222 restraining notice on a garnishee bank's New York branch is ineffective under the separate entity rule to freeze assets held in the bank's foreign branches. The separate entity rule, a firmly established principle of New York law with a history of application both before and after the adoption of the CPLR, provides that even when a bank garnishee with a New York branch is subject to personal jurisdiction, its other branches are to be treated as separate entities for certain purposes, particularly with respect to CPLR article 62 prejudgment attachments and article 52 postjudgment restraining notices and turnover orders. As a long-standing common-law doctrine, the separate entity rule functions as a limiting principle in the context of international banking. The reasons that led to the adoption of the rule, i.e., the risk of competing claims and the possibility of double liability in separate jurisdictions, and the reality that foreign branches are subject to a multitude of legal and regulatory regimes, remain significant concerns. By limiting the reach of a CPLR 5222 restraining notice in the foreign banking context, the separate entity rule promotes international comity and serves to avoid conflicts among competing legal systems. Moreover, notwithstanding technological advancements and centralized banking, courts have continued to recognize the practical constraints and costs associated with conducting a worldwide search for a judgment debtor's assets. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ISSUE: Whether a cyberbullying statute, Albany County, N.Y., Local Law No. 11 (2010), was overbroad and facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Law No. 11 (2010) of County of Albany, criminalizing &quot;cyberbullying&quot; and motivated by the laudable public purpose of shielding children from cyberbullying, is overbroad as drafted and facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. On its face, the law covered communications aimed at adults, and fictitious or corporate entities, even though its passage was justified based on the detrimental effects that cyberbullying has on school-aged children. Further, the methods of expression listed by the law as examples of covered communications were not limited to instances of cyberbullying but included every conceivable form of electronic communication. Finally, the provision pertained to electronic communications meant to &quot;harass, annoy . . . taunt . . . [or] humiliate&quot; any person or entity, not just those intended to &quot;threaten, abuse . . . intimidate, torment . . . or otherwise inflict significant emotional harm on&quot; a child. Moreover, it was not a permissible use of judicial authority to sever the offending portions of the law and interpret it to include only three types of electronic communications sent with the intent to inflict emotional harm on a child--sexually explicit photographs, private or personal sexual information and false sexual information--with no legitimate public, personal or private purpose. The text of the law did not adequately reflect an intent to so restrict its reach, and significant modifications to the applications of the law therefore would have been necessary to achieve such an interpretation. Accordingly, the restrictions on speech contained in Local Law No. 11 did not survive strict scrutiny. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 480 (b) did not require defendant/respondent City of New York to make &quot;Increased-Take-Home-Pay&quot; (ITHP) pension contributions on behalf of New York City police officers and firefighters appointed on or after July 1, 2009. Those public employees were tier 3 members of the New York City Police Pension Fund and the New York City Fire Department Pension Fund, and the City properly deducted 3% from their gross annual wages as mandatory employee pension contributions. Section 480 (b) only encompasses temporary programs in place as of 1974 for tier 1 and 2 members of a public employee retirement system; it does not obligate a public employer to pay any portion of a tier 3 public employee's statutorily required pension contribution. Although section 480 (b) does not identify, and therefore does not on its face limit, the tier of the members of the state and local public retirement systems who benefit from the temporary programs that it encompasses, the legislative history that exists reflects a common understanding that ITHP is a benefit available only to tier 1 and 2 employees. Moreover, such an interpretation of section 480 (b) is consistent with the overall design of New York's tiered public employee pension systems and the series of pension reforms implemented to reduce public employers' pension costs. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Town zoning laws banning oil and gas production activities, including hydrofracking, were valid and were not preempted by the supersession clause in the statewide Oil, Gas and Solution Mining Law (OGSML) (ECL 23-0303 [2]). In light of its plain language, its place within the OGSML's framework and the legislative background, the supersession clause does not evince a clear expression of preemptive intent. ECL 23-0303 (2), which states that the OGSML &quot;shall supersede all local laws or ordinances relating to the regulation of the oil, gas and solution mining industries,&quot; is most naturally read as preempting only local laws that purport to regulate the actual operations of oil and gas activities, not zoning ordinances that restrict or prohibit certain land uses within town boundaries. In addition, the OGSML is concerned with the Department of Environmental Conservation's regulation and authority regarding the safety, technical and operational aspects of oil and gas activities across the state, and the supersession clause fits comfortably within that legislative framework since it invalidates local laws that would intrude on the Department's regulatory oversight of the industry's operations, thereby ensuring uniform exploratory and extraction processes related to oil and gas production. Moreover, the legislative history of the OGSML and its predecessor makes clear that the state legislature's primary concern was with preventing wasteful oil and gas practices and ensuring that the Department had the means to regulate the technical operations of the industry. Accordingly, the towns appropriately acted within their home rule authority in adopting the challenged zoning laws. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the prosecution of defendant arising from an incident in which he shot his cousin in the leg, the evidence that defendant possessed a loaded firearm, together with the statutory presumption of intent arising from such possession, was legally sufficient to support defendant's conviction for criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree under Penal Law &sect; 265.03 (1) (b). A person is guilty under section 265.03 (1) (b) when he or she possesses a loaded firearm &quot;with intent to use the same unlawfully against another.&quot; Penal Law &sect; 265.15 (4) provides that the possession by any person of any weapon is presumptive evidence of intent to use it unlawfully against another. This permissive presumption allows the trier of fact to determine the existence of an element of the crime from the existence of one or more evidentiary or basic facts. Before the presumption may apply, the People must establish beyond a reasonable doubt the predicate fact or facts that the statute requires be proved. Given the testimony that defendant admitted shooting his cousin, a rational jury could have concluded that defendant's possession of a loaded firearm was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. With this fact established, the jury was entitled to infer that defendant intended to use the weapon unlawfully, and its acceptance of the presumption was reasonable. There was no proof that defendant possessed the gun for a lawful purpose, and the evidence that he disposed of the gun, initially lied about the shooting and urged his cousin not to go to court supported the inference of unlawful intent. While evidence may have suggested that defendant shot his cousin accidentally, the People were not required to prove that he intended to use the gun unlawfully against any particular person. </SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-Under the first Boreali v. Axelrod factor, the Board, in adopting the Portion Cap Rule, exceeded the scope of its regulatory authority because by choosing among competing policy goals without any legislative delegation or guidance, it engaged in law-making and thus infringed upon the legislative jurisdiction of the N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Delegation of Legislative Power -- New York City Board of Health</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Respondent New York City Board of Health does not have legislative powers separate and apart from the New York City Council. Under the New York City Charter the City Council is the sole legislative branch of city government. The provision of the City Charter that sets out the Board's authority to add to, amend or repeal parts of the New York City Health Code; publish additional provisions for security of life and health; and confer additional powers on the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene that are not inconsistent with the NY Constitution, state law or the City Charter (NY City Charter &sect; 558 [b]) reflects only a regulatory mandate, not legislative authority. The Charter contains no suggestion that the Board of Health has the authority to create laws. Rather, the Charter empowers the City Council to adopt local laws in order to preserve the public health (NY City Charter &sect; 28 [a]), and restricts the Board's rulemaking to the publication of a health code. Accordingly, the Board exercised regulatory, rather than legislative, authority in adopting the &quot;Sugary Drinks Portion Cap Rule&quot; (NY City Health Code [24 RCNY] &sect; 81.53) so as to restrict the size of cups and containers used by food service establishments for the provision of sugary beverages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Sugary Drinks Portion Cap Rule -- Regulation Exceeded Delegated Authority </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent New York City Board of Health, in adopting the &quot;Sugary Drinks Portion Cap Rule&quot; (NY City Health Code [24 RCNY] &sect; 81.53) so as to restrict the size of cups and containers used by food service establishments for the provision of sugary beverages, exceeded the scope of its regulatory authority. Because a doctrine of separation of powers is delineated in the City Charter,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Boreali v Axelrod</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (71 NY2d 1, 517 NE2d 1350, 523 NYS2d 464 [1987]) provided the appropriate analytical framework. The four coalescing circumstances in</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Boreali</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are overlapping, closely related factors that, taken together, support the conclusion that an agency has crossed the line into legislative territory. Here, the Board engaged in law-making beyond its regulatory authority under the first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Boreali</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> factor by making value judgments entailing difficult and complex choices between broad public policy ends--choices reserved to the legislative branch. As to the second </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Boreali</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> factor, absent any legislation concerning the consumption of sugary beverages that the rule was designed to supplement, it is clear the Board wrote the rule without the benefit of legislative guidance, and did not simply fill in details guided by independent legislation. Regarding the third </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Boreali</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> factor, the city and state legislatures had unsuccessfully attempted to target sugar sweetened beverages and the Board's rule addressed the same policy areas as the proposals rejected by the legislatures. Here, the first three factors were present, and the fourth </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Boreali</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> factor, whether special expertise or technical competence was involved in the development of the rule, did not need to be addressed. By choosing among competing policy goals, without any legislative delegation or guidance, the Board engaged in law-making and thus infringed upon the legislative jurisdiction of the New York City Council. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Dismissal of Appeal -- Involuntarily Deported Defendant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's appeal from the Appellate Division order denying his application for a writ of error coram nobis seeking leave to file a late notice of appeal from a judgment which had convicted him, upon his plea of guilty, of criminal sale of a controlled substance was not dismissed notwithstanding defendant's involuntary removal from the United States. Defendant's removal by federal authorities on the basis of the underlying conviction occurred after defendant was granted leave to appeal by the Court of Appeals and despite apparent assurances that removal would not occur while the appeal was pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Leave to File Late Notice of Appeal -- Writ of Error Coram Nobis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant's application for a writ of error coram nobis seeking leave to file a late notice of appeal from a judgment which had convicted him, upon his plea of guilty, of possessing a sexual performance by a child on the ground that his attorney had been ineffective for failing to file a notice of direct appeal following the conviction should not have been granted by the Appellate Division, as defendant had moved, unsuccessfully, for leave to file a late notice of direct appeal pursuant to CPL 460.30 before the statutory one-year grace period elapsed. The writ of error coram nobis used by courts to correct errors for which no other avenue of judicial relief is apparent includes claims premised on the loss of the right to an appeal caused by deficient legal performance. CPL 460.30 permits a defendant to seek permission to file a late notice of direct appeal in certain circumstances, and requires the motion to be made within one year after the time for taking the appeal has expired. An exception is warranted for a defendant who does not invoke CPL 460.30 within the one-year grace period because defense counsel inexcusably failed to comply with a timely request to file a notice of appeal. Defendant, however, realized that a notice of appeal had not been filed within 30 days of sentencing and moved for CPL 460.30 relief before the one-year grace period elapsed. By invoking that procedure, he could not later seek similar relief in a coram nobis proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Leave to File Late Notice of Appeal -- Writ of Error Coram Nobis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant's application for a writ of error coram nobis seeking leave to file a late notice of appeal from a judgment which had convicted defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of criminal sale of a controlled substance was properly rejected by the Appellate Division, as it did not provide sufficient factual allegations to demonstrate that defendant's appellate rights were lost as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant made only perfunctory claims that he asked his lawyer to file a timely notice of appeal and that it was impossible to discover the omission with reasonable diligence within the statutory one-year grace period provided for in CPL 460.30. Defense counsel stated that she had discussions regarding the possibility of an appeal with defendant and he decided not to pursue that route because he wanted to accept a sentence of time served and end his case. Those statements were consistent with defendant's execution of a written waiver of his right to appeal in the presence of the judge who presided at the guilty plea proceeding, which presumptively demonstrated a desire not to seek appellate review. Defense counsel further recalled that it was the court's usual practice to provide defendants with written notice of the right to appeal. Nothing defendant offered countered those assertions--he did not claim that his attorney or the court failed to inform him about the appellate process, or that he asked for a notice of appeal to be filed. Nor did defendant attempt to explain why he waited more than two years to seek coram nobis relief after he obtained an attorney to represent him on collateral review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Leave to File Late Criminal Leave Application -- Writ of Error Coram Nobis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant's application for a writ of error coram nobis seeking leave to file a late criminal leave application for discretionary review by the Court of Appeals of an Appellate Division order affirming the judgment which had convicted defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of burglary in the first degree was properly rejected by the Appellate Division. Defendant claimed that his lawyer agreed to file the criminal leave application but had neglected to do so. Unlike an appeal as of right, there is no federal constitutional entitlement to legal representation on a discretionary application for an appeal to a state's highest court. Thus, the failure to file a criminal leave application, standing alone, did not necessarily establish that defendant was deprived of effective assistance of counsel or due process of law. He was therefore not entitled to coram nobis relief.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Criminal Impersonation - Injury to Reputation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A person may be found guilty of criminal impersonation in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 190.25) if he or she impersonates someone with the intent to harm the reputation of another. The terms &quot;injure&quot; and &quot;benefit&quot; as used in Penal Law &sect; 190.25 cannot be construed to apply to any injury or benefit, no matter how slight, but injury to reputation is within the &quot;injury&quot; contemplated by Penal Law &sect; 190.25. Many people, particularly those with a career in academia, value their reputations at least as much as their property. Accordingly, in a prosecution arising from defendant's Internet campaign to attack the integrity and harm the reputation of certain Dead Sea Scrolls academics and scholars while promoting the views of his father, another Dead Sea Scrolls scholar, there was sufficient evidence supporting the jury's finding that defendant's emails impersonating three different professors as part of the campaign were more than a prank intended to cause temporary embarrassment or discomfiture, and that defendant acted with intent to do real harm, thereby committing criminal impersonation in the second degree.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Criminal Impersonation -- Creation of Email Account in Another's Name</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a prosecution arising from defendant's Internet campaign to attack the integrity and harm the reputation of certain Dead Sea Scrolls academics and scholars while promoting the views of his father, another Dead Sea Scrolls scholar, defendant's creation of email accounts in the names of four other people, in contrast to the use of those accounts to send emails, did not constitute criminal conduct under Penal Law &sect; 190.25 and was insufficient to support defendant's conviction for criminal impersonation in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 190.25). The mere creation of email accounts that are not used does no substantial harm to anyone.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Criminal Impersonation -- Email Sent in Another's Name</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a prosecution arising from defendant's Internet campaign to attack the integrity and harm the reputation of certain Dead Sea Scrolls academics and scholars while promoting the views of his father, another Dead Sea Scrolls scholar, an email defendant sent in another person's name to a curator of a Scrolls exhibit asking her opinion on the differing theories about the Scrolls and whether she was planning to answer a critique of the exhibit by defendant's father was insufficient to support defendant's conviction for criminal impersonation in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 190.25). Unlike other emails sent by defendant, the email sent to the curator did not prove the requisite intent to cause injury, either to reputation or otherwise.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Aggravated Harassment in Second Degree</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (1), which criminalizes any communication that has the intent to annoy, is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad under both the State and Federal Constitutions. Any proscription of pure speech must be sharply limited to words which, by their utterance alone, inflict injury or tend naturally to evoke immediate violence. No fair reading of the statute's unqualified terms supports or even suggests the constitutionally necessary limitations on its scope. Accordingly, defendant's conviction of three counts of aggravated harassment in the second degree in violation of Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (1) were vacated.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Forgery -- Email Sent in Another's Name</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In a prosecution arising from defendant's Internet campaign to attack the integrity and harm the reputation of certain Dead Sea Scrolls academics and scholars while promoting the views of his father, another Dead Sea Scrolls scholar, there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant deceived people by sending emails from accounts in the names of three professors, in support of defendant's conviction for forgery in the third degree (Penal Law &sect; 170.05).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unauthorized Use of Computer -- What Constitutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. In a prosecution arising from defendant's Internet campaign to attack the integrity and harm the reputation of certain Dead Sea Scrolls academics and scholars while promoting the views of his father, another Dead Sea Scrolls scholar, the People did not sustain their burden of proof that defendant was guilty of unauthorized use of the computers at the university he had attended and from which he had sent some emails in connection with his campaign. Under Penal Law &sect; 156.05, &quot;[a] person is guilty of unauthorized use of a computer when he or she knowingly uses, causes to be used, or accesses a computer, computer service, or computer network without authorization.&quot; The term &quot;without authorization&quot; is defined as &quot;to access a computer . . . without the permission of the owner . . . or after actual notice to such person that such use or access was without permission&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 156.00 [8]). Defendant asserted that he had permission to access the university computers as an alumnus who joined a certain library program. The definitions and wording of the statute and the legislative history indicate that the statute was intended to reach a person who accesses a computer system without permission (i.e., a hacker) and the language does not appear to encompass defendant's conduct here.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Identity Theft -- Falsifying Business Records</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. In a prosecution arising from defendant's Internet campaign to attack the integrity and harm the reputation of certain Dead Sea Scrolls academics and scholars while promoting the views of his father, another Dead Sea Scrolls scholar, there was insufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for identity theft in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 190.79 [3]). A person commits identity theft in the second degree in violation of section 190.79 (3) &quot;when he or she knowingly and with intent to defraud assumes the identity of another person by presenting himself or herself as that other person, or by acting as that other person or by using personal identifying information of that other person, and thereby&quot; &quot;commits or attempts to commit a felony&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 190.79 [3]). Defendant's alleged attempted felony was first-degree falsifying of business records, a crime that is committed when a person &quot;commits the crime of falsifying business records in the second degree, and when his intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 175.10). Although defendant sent damning emails in the name of a professor at a particular university to university addresses, that did not constitute the creation or falsification of a university business record that was &quot;kept or maintained by an enterprise for the purpose of evidencing or reflecting its condition or activity&quot; as defined in Penal Law &sect; 175.00 (2), and the People did not point to any proof that defendant falsified any such records. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The court previously held in Matter of State of New York v Floyd Y. that hearsay basis testimony by an expert witness may be admitted at a Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.01 trial if the hearsay is reliable and its probative value in assisting the jury to evaluate the expert's opinion substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect; [2]-The court held that the hearsay basis testimony about respondent's 1968 sex offenses that did not lead to valid adjudications of guilt satisfied that standard and were properly admitted at trial because the unsealed records at issue, namely the indictments, presentence reports, police reports, victim's statements, and other documents, were the types of records the New York Legislature contemplated the State would have access to in a Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.08(c) proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Civil Commitment or Supervision -- Unsealed Records</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a Mental Hygiene Law article 10 proceeding seeking a determination that respondent was a detained sex offender requiring civil management, records related to certain rape and robbery charges against defendant in 1968 that were previously sealed pursuant to CPL 160.50 were properly unsealed pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law &sect;10.08 (c) and disclosed to the State. Mental Hygiene Law &sect;10.08 (c) contemplates broad disclosure of records relating to a respondent's commission or alleged commission of a sex offense as well as any information relevant to the civil management determination, and authorizes disclosure &quot;[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law&quot; that might otherwise prohibit it. The meaning of the statute's &quot;notwithstanding&quot; clause is plainly understood and supersedes any inconsistent provisions of state law, including the sealing procedures set forth in CPL 160.50. The unsealed indictments, presentence reports, police reports, and victim's statements, among other documents in the possession of official entities, were the types of records the legislature contemplated the State would have access to in an article 10 proceeding (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mental Hygiene Law &sect;10.08 [c]). Respondent pleaded guilty in satisfaction of the 1968 indictments, and although his convictions were later vacated on mental incompetency grounds, the fact remained that respondent was charged and indicted for those crimes. Mental Hygiene Law &sect;10.08 (c), by authorizing disclosure of records relating to the &quot;alleged commission of a sex offense,&quot; necessarily contemplates the release of records which document sex offenses that did not result in valid adjudications of guilt. The 1968 records also qualified for disclosure under the statute's catch-all provision because they contained &quot;information relevant to a determination&quot; of whether respondent required civil management under article 10 (Mental Hygiene Law &sect;10.08 [c]).  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a Mental Hygiene Law article 10 proceeding seeking a determination that respondent was a detained sex offender requiring civil management, CPL 160.60 did not bar disclosure under Mental Hygiene Law &sect;10.08 (c) of records related to certain rape and robbery charges against defendant in 1968 that were previously sealed pursuant to CPL 160.50 when defendant's convictions were vacated on mental incompetency grounds. CPL 160.60 provides, in pertinent part, that once a criminal action or proceeding has terminated in favor of the accused, &quot;the arrest and prosecution shall be deemed a nullity,&quot; and the information about that arrest or prosecution may not be disclosed &quot;[e]xcept where specifically required or permitted by statute or upon specific authorization of a superior court.&quot; The statute states by its plain terms that its provisions may be superseded by another statute, such as Mental Hygiene Law &sect;10.08 (c), that permits disclosure of the sealed information. Although an arrest or prosecution terminated in a defendant's favor must generally be &quot;deemed a nullity&quot; under CPL 160.60, that statute does not bar the disclosure of records that, for the purposes of Mental Hygiene Law article 10, relate to a respondent's alleged commission of a sex offense. Moreover, to the extent respondent was concerned that a &quot;stigma&quot; might result from the disclosure of his unsealed records, Mental Hygiene Law &sect;10.08 (c) already provides that &quot;confidential materials&quot; obtained pursuant to that statute &quot;shall not be further disseminated or otherwise used except for [article 10] purposes.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a Mental Hygiene Law article 10 proceeding seeking a determination that respondent was a detained sex offender requiring civil management, Supreme Court did not abuse its discretion by permitting hearsay basis testimony by expert witnesses about the 1968 robbery and rape charges against respondent which resulted in convictions that were subsequently vacated on mental incompetency grounds. A court may admit hearsay evidence when it serves as the underlying basis for an expert's opinion in an article 10 proceeding if the hearsay is reliable and the probative value in helping the jury evaluate the expert's opinion substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. The 1968 charges never resulted in a valid adjudication of guilt necessary for the hearsay evidence to be considered inherently reliable, and there was no independently reliable evidence in the record showing that respondent admitted to committing any of those offenses. However respondent was never acquitted of the 1968 charges, as his convictions were vacated due to mental incompetency at the time of his guilty plea. Here, the trial court satisfied the standard for the proper admission of basis testimony based on its close scrutiny of the evidence, weighing reliability considerations and reasonably concluding that the hearsay's probative value to the jury in evaluating the experts' opinions substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect. The charges were based on complaints from five different victims attacked within a certain area and within a 32-day time period, and each attack involved a strikingly similar pattern. Moreover, respondent was indicted for all five incidents and pleaded guilty to one count each of rape and robbery in satisfaction of all indicted counts. The evidence underlying the indictments had never been called into question.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Civil Commitment or Supervision -- Admission of Hearsay Evidence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a Mental Hygiene Law article 10 proceeding seeking a determination that respondent was a detained sex offender requiring civil management, Supreme Court abused its discretion by permitting hearsay basis testimony by expert witnesses about a 1978 rape for which defendant was arrested but never charged. A court may admit hearsay evidence when it serves as the underlying basis for an expert's opinion in an article 10 proceeding if the hearsay is reliable and the probative value in helping the jury evaluate the expert's opinion substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. Information about the uncharged rape was culled from a presentence report prepared in connection with an earlier rape for which defendant was convicted. Although hearsay information found in presentence reports is inherently reliable for purposes of determining the appropriate risk level of a sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration Act, that rule does not extend to article 10 proceedings, where the liberty interests at stake are greater and the factfinders are often not judges but juries. Therefore, while the hearsay information contained in a presentence report bears certain indicia of reliability that, if supported by other reliable evidence at an article 10 trial, may warrant the admission of basis testimony about uncharged crimes, hearsay related to uncharged crimes must be excluded if its only basis for reliability is that it came from a presentence report. Here the allegations contained in the presentence report were not supported by any other reliable evidence, and respondent steadfastly denied he committed the second rape. The State pointed to the factual similarities between the first rape and the uncharged rape as evidence of corroboration, as well as the indication in the presentence report that the police were able to connect respondent to the first rape based on information they received from the second victim. It was improper to assume, however, that the report's description of both the uncharged rape and the police's subsequent investigation was reliable in the absence of supporting evidence or an admission from respondent.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In a Mental Hygiene Law article 10 proceeding seeking a determination that respondent was a detained sex offender requiring civil management, Supreme Court's error in permitting hearsay basis testimony by expert witnesses about the 1978 rape for which defendant was arrested but never charged was harmless. The State's case against respondent rested primarily on admissible evidence; particularly, expert basis testimony about the 1968 robbery and rape charges against respondent which resulted in convictions that were subsequently vacated on mental incompetency grounds, his two convictions for rape, his assault on a female correction officer, and his refusal to participate in sex offender treatment while in prison. The jury also heard testimony from a parole officer that respondent admitted to committing one of the 1968 rapes for which he was charged. This evidence, without reference to the uncharged 1978 rape, provided a sufficient basis for the jury to conclude that respondent suffered from a mental abnormality, and there was no reasonable possibility that the jury could have reached another verdict had it not heard basis testimony about that uncharged crime.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Civil Commitment or Supervision -- Mental Abnormality </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. In a Mental Hygiene Law article 10 proceeding seeking a determination that respondent was a detained sex offender requiring civil management, the evidence at trial was sufficient to support the jury's verdict that respondent, who was diagnosed by both parties' experts as suffering from antisocial personality disorder, suffered from a mental abnormality qualifying him for civil management. During their testimony, the State's experts explained how respondent's sex crimes were not simply isolated incidents, but a result of his antisocial personality disorder, and that the traits that account for this disorder--such as his impulsivity, aggression, disregard for social norms, and indifference to harming others--resulted in respondent's pathological sense of entitlement and serious difficulty controlling his sexual conduct. The jury was entitled to credit that expert testimony, which was supported not only by respondent's history of sex offending, but also by his prison disciplinary record, denial of his crimes, and failure to partake in prison sex offender treatment, among other things. Moreover, the evidence indicating that respondent had raped women at three separate periods over a span of decades, notwithstanding serious sanctions, could have led a rational jury to conclude that respondent suffered from the serious lack of control over his conduct required for a mental abnormality finding. Although respondent's expert testified that respondent was unlikely to reoffend based on his age, the jury could have reasonably rejected that assertion in light of competing testimony from the State's experts. </SPAN></P>

In related proceedings to vacate arbitration awards finding petitioner teachers guilty of misconduct related to a teachers' union picketing demonstration that took place on a public street in front of a school, the demonstration, which consisted of petitioners and others displaying picketing signs from their cars parked where parents were dropping their children off at school, was a form of &quot;speech&quot; protected by the First Amendment. As a general matter, peaceful picketing is an expressive activity involving speech protected by the First Amendment. The evidence at the arbitration hearings provided a rational basis for the affirmed finding of fact by the arbitrators that, on the morning in question, petitioners engaged in picketing from their cars parked on the street in front of the school. Although the arbitrators also determined that petitioners intended to create a disruption by parking in the student drop-off area, that finding did not, under the circumstances here, deprive petitioners' picketing activity of its status as speech.  </SPAN></P>

Although petitioners' speech as embodied in the parking demonstration, which consisted of petitioners and others displaying picketing signs from their cars parked where parents were dropping their children off at school, was protected by the First Amendment, petitioners' interests in engaging in that constitutionally protected speech in a manner that interfered with the safety of students were outweighed by respondent school district's interests in maintaining an orderly, safe school. Under the two-part </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Pickering</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> test, a court must determine whether the speech which led to an employee's discipline related to a matter of public concern, and whether the public employer met its burden of demonstrating that the discipline arising out of the employee's protected activity was justified. Petitioners' speech was on a matter of public concern, but respondent met its burden of proving that petitioners' speech was disruptive enough to justify the imposition of discipline. Respondent's interests in ensuring the safety of its students and maintaining orderly operations at the school were legitimate, and the evidence adduced at the hearings showed that the parking demonstration created dangerous traffic conditions in front of the school that could have injured a student and that caused actual disruption to the school's operations. The evidence was sufficient to justify respondent's discipline of petitioners, and respondent was not required to prove that a student was actually injured for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Pickering</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> balance to tip in respondent's favor. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a criminal prosecution, defendant validly waived his right to be present during bench conferences at which prospective jurors were questioned on voir dire. Defendant made an implicit waiver of that right when, after hearing the judge state that defendant was &quot;welcome to attend&quot; any conferences at the bench, he chose not to do so. Notwithstanding that the judge did not state that the defendant had the &quot;right&quot; to attend, it was important for defendant to understand that he was free to attend bench conferences if he wanted to, not whether his opportunity to attend was a right or privilege. In addition, defendant explicitly waived his right to be present during the voir dire bench conferences by his attorney's statement to the court, at a bench conference, that he had discussed with defendant that he had the right to go up to the bench during the conferences and that defendant had waived that right. Although the lawyer's statement waiving the right was not made in defendant's hearing, a lawyer may be trusted to explain rights to his or her client and to report to the court the result of that discussion.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-As the legislature did not expressly delegate to the county any authority to enact local laws that superseded special state tax laws, under N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 1, the county was not authorized to enact Local Law 18; [2]-N.Y. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Inconsistency with State Law -- Tax Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nassau County was prohibited by NY Constitution article IX and the Municipal Home Rule Law from passing Local Law No. 18-2010 of the County of Nassau, which shifted the obligation to pay real property tax refunds from the County, as provided for in an amendment to the County's Administrative Code passed by the state legislature known as the County Guaranty, to its individual taxing districts, thereby superseding a special state tax law. The state legislature has not delegated to the County the prerogative to supersede a special state tax law, and that lack of authority is fatal to Local Law 18. The County Charter, as established by the legislature, does not vest in the County the right to repeal a special state tax law. Moreover, the Constitution bars the County from exercising its powers of local legislation to supersede the County Guaranty. In addition to the absence of constitutional or statutory authority allowing the County to enact Local Law 18, the Municipal Home Rule Law affirmatively prohibited the County from doing so. Local Law 18 is a charter law, and Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 34 (3) (a) specifies that such a law &quot;shall not supersede&quot; any &quot;special law&quot; of the State &quot;relat[ing] to&quot; the &quot;judicial review or distribution&quot; of tax proceeds or benefit assessments. Because the County Guaranty is a special state law which &quot;relates to&quot; the &quot;distribution&quot; of tax proceeds and benefits, the County could not enact Local Law 18 to supersede it. The County possesses substantial home rule powers, but the prerogative to impinge freely upon the State's constitutional power of taxation, by means of superseding a special state tax law, is not among them. Because Local Law 18 was designed to achieve that impermissible intrusion, it was declared unconstitutional, invalid, unenforceable and void.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Appellate Division erred in granting the motion filed by defendant's appellate counsel in which he argued that there were no non-frivolous issues to be raised on defendant's behalf and asked to be relieved as counsel, as defendant's claims that Penal Law &sect; 70.85 was unconstitutional as applied to her case and that she was denied effective assistance of counsel at every level were not wholly frivolous at the time counsel filed the motion. Appellate counsel may withdraw from representing a defendant if the appeal is &quot;wholly frivolous&quot; because a defendant whose appeal is frivolous has no right to have an advocate make his or her case to the appellate court. Here, upon the appeal of her resentence, pursuant to the then-recently enacted Penal Law &sect; 70.85, to her original determinate sentence without a term of postrelease supervision, defendant was assigned counsel. Counsel informed defendant of a Court of Appeals decision that upheld a defendant's sentence under Penal Law &sect; 70.85, but left open the constitutionality of that statute, stating that it should be decided by the sentencing court in the first instance. However, counsel filed the motion to be relieved as counsel and asked to be relieved despite that open issue. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Penal Law &sect;70.85, which authorizes a trial court to &quot;re-impose,&quot; with the People's consent, an originally imposed determinate sentence of imprisonment without any term of postrelease supervision, is a constitutionally permissible legislative remedy for the defectiveness of a guilty plea pursuant to which a defendant is sentenced to a determinate term but the court failed to include a mandatory term of postrelease supervision. Accordingly, defendant, who pleaded guilty to attempted assault and was sentenced to a determinate sentence of incarceration without being informed of the required period of postrelease supervision, was not unconstitutionally deprived of his right to vacate his plea when he was resentenced pursuant to section 70.85 to the same term of imprisonment without any postrelease supervision. Defendant's plea was knowing and voluntary because the legislature had changed the sentencing laws governing pleas vulnerable to a challenge pursuant to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (4 NY3d 242, 825 NE2d 1081, 792 NYS2d 887 [2005]). Section 70.85 ensures that defendant, who is no longer subject to postrelease supervision, pleaded guilty with the requisite awareness of the direct consequences of his plea. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Hotel and Motel Occupancy Tax -- Extension of Tax to Cover Fees Charged by Travel Companies --- Constitutionality</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Law No. 43 (2009) of City of New York, which amended the City's hotel occupancy tax to include in the definition of rent &quot;any service and/or booking fees that are a condition of occupancy,&quot; thereby taxing the total rent or charge paid by a hotel occupant, including sums paid directly to third-party travel companies, known under the law as room remarketers, is constitutional on its face. New York State, in granting the City broad authority to enact an occupancy tax, extended to the City a taxing power coextensive with that of the State (CLS Uncons Laws of NY, ch 288-C, &sect; 1 [1]). Under the enabling statute, the City may only tax &quot;rent or charge&quot; and may collect the tax from a hotel owner or &quot;person entitled to be paid the rent or charge&quot; (CLS Uncons Laws of NY, ch 288-C, &sect;1 [1-a], [3]). The terms &quot;rent&quot; and &quot;charge&quot; refer to the consideration received for occupancy. By enacting a tax on third-party fees that are made &quot;a condition of occupancy&quot; (Local Law No. 43 [2009] of City of NY &sect; 1), the City enacted a tax that applies only to the rent or charge. Insofar as plaintiffs are entitled to be paid the rent or charge for the hotel room, the City may collect the tax directly from plaintiffs. Thus, Local Law 43 adheres to its enabling purpose, the taxation of hotel occupancy rent and charges, by taxing everything a hotel occupant actually pays for occupancy when booking online. That New York State enacted a law in 2010 that explicitly authorized the City's tax on hotel remarketers was irrelevant inasmuch as the City had the authority to enact the tax under the original enabling legislation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In hybrid proceedings and declaratory judgment actions in which petitioners, current and former village officials, challenged respondent Village's determination to discontinue providing a defense and indemnification to them in certain civil actions after they refused to accept a settlement offer containing a nondisparagement clause requiring them to agree not to ever interfere with or challenge or criticize the terms of the stipulation of settlement, the determination did not violate petitioners' First Amendment rights as an impermissible prior restraint on free speech. There was no evidence that the Village was responsible for the nondisparagement clause in the settlement offer or that the Village actively sought to restrict petitioners' speech. The plaintiffs in the civil actions were private parties entitled to offer settlement on whatever terms they saw fit and were the only parties that could have enforced the nondisparagement clause. Nor was the Village's threat to withdraw the defense and indemnification a prior restraint on speech, since the reason for the threat was to end the litigation and save public funds and not to suppress speech. Further, the actual withdrawal of the defense and indemnification was in response to petitioners' failure to cooperate and not a restraint on what they could say in the future.  </SPAN></P>

In hybrid proceedings and declaratory judgment actions in which petitioners, current and former village officials, challenged respondent Village's determination to discontinue providing a defense and indemnification to them in certain civil actions after they refused to accept a settlement offer containing a nondisparagement clause requiring them to agree not to ever interfere with or challenge or criticize the terms of the stipulation of settlement, the determination did not violate petitioners' First Amendment rights as retaliation for their refusal to give up their rights to criticize the settlement. To succeed on a First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must prove that he or she engaged in a protected activity and that the defendant engaged in retaliatory conduct that was motivated by plaintiff's protected conduct. Here, there was no evidence that the Village retaliated against petitioners for their desire to be able to criticize the settlement. Instead, the Village declined to fund the defense after petitioners unreasonably refused to settle.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Respondent Village Board of Trustees did not act improperly when it determined to discontinue providing a defense and indemnification for petitioners, current and former village officials, in certain civil actions based on their failure to cooperate after they refused to accept a reasonable settlement offer containing a nondisparagement clause. The Village's duty to defend and indemnify an employee in a civil action arising out of any alleged act or omission occurring while the employee was acting within the scope of the public employment is conditioned upon &quot;[t]he full cooperation of the employee in the defense of such action ... against the Village based upon the same act or omission&quot; (FreeportVillage Code &sect; 130-6 [A] [2]; Public Officers Law &sect; 18 [5] [ii]). The absence of a provision in Public Officers Law &sect; 18 allowing the Village to settle without petitioners' consent is not dispositive of the Village's authority to do so. The legislature did not intend to restrict the meaning of the &quot;cooperation&quot; provision to permit a public employee to refuse a generous settlement offer and expose a municipality to potentially ruinous liability. Here, the Village acted diligently to bring about petitioners' cooperation with the settlement offer. When petitioners' counsel expressed reservations about the offer and the potential free speech violations posed by the nondisparagement clause, the Village's counsel responded to each of those concerns and explained why the clause was proper. Moreover, the record supported the lower courts' findings with regard to petitioners' attitudes of willful and avowed obstruction in unreasonably rejecting the offer.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Respondent Village Board of Trustees' executive session decision to discontinue providing a defense and indemnification to petitioners, current and former public officials, in certain civil actions when they refused to accept a reasonable settlement offer after the Village had already settled in those actions was not invalid as a violation of the Open Meetings Law. While the Open Meetings Law prohibits public bodies from conducting business in executive session outside the view of the public, an exception exists for discussions regarding proposed, pending or current litigation (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Officers Law &sect;&sect; 103, 105 [1] [d]). Even if the Board's decision in withdrawing the defense and indemnification did not regard pending or current litigation to which the Village was a party, the lower courts did not abuse their discretion in finding that any violations were unintentional and did not warrant invalidation of the Board's decision. </SPAN></P>

II right to keep and bear arms. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the three and a half year sentence defendant received for unlawful possession did not raise constitutional problems.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Review -- Constitutional Challenge to Weapons Possession Offense -- Posttrial Motion</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant's constitutional challenge to a second degree weapons charge was adequately preserved for appeal where defendant raised the challenge in a motion after trial, but before sentence, pursuant to a CPL 330.30 motion to set aside his conviction on that charge and where the trial court decided the motion on the merits (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 470.05 [2]). In his motion defendant argued that conversion of a weapon possession crime to a class C felony on the basis of his prior misdemeanor conviction was an infringement of his right to keep and bear arms. The trial court might well have been within its discretion if it had refused to consider defendant's CPL 330.30 motion since CPL 255.10 (1) (a) defines a motion to dismiss or reduce an indictment as a &quot;[p]retrial motion,&quot; and CPL 255.20 (1) requires such motions to be made within 45 days after arraignment and before commencement of trial. However, the People, though complaining of the motion's tardiness, did not suggest that they had been prejudiced by the delay. Moreover, the court was not powerless to decide defendant's motion on the merits. Defendant could have asserted his constitutional claim in a motion to dismiss the indictment pursuant to CPL 210.20, a motion that must normally be made before trial, but one which &quot;the court, in the interest of justice, and for good cause shown, may, in its discretion, at any time before sentence, entertain and dispose of ... on the merits&quot; (CPL 255.20 [3]). The court was not deprived of its discretion because defendant may have put the wrong section number--CPL 330.30 rather than 210.20--on his motion papers, and it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to entertain the belated motion.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant's sentence of 3&frac12; years of imprisonment for criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 265.03 [3]), in a prosecution in which he alleged that his Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms was infringed by the statutory scheme which increased his punishment for illegally possessing a loaded unlicensed handgun in his home based on his prior conviction of a crime, did not transgress Second Amendment limits. Assuming that the punishment imposed on defendant was subject to Second Amendment scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, requiring an inquiry as to whether a challenged statute bears a substantial relationship to the achievement of an important governmental objective, was appropriate. Penal Law &sect; 265.03 (3), making it a class C felony for anyone previously convicted of any crime to possess an unlicensed, loaded firearm in his home or elsewhere, easily passed that test. It is beyond dispute that preventing the criminal use of firearms is an important government objective; and keeping guns away from people who have shown they cannot be trusted to obey the law is a means substantially related to that end. More specifically, to punish severely a convicted criminal such as defendant who, though eligible for a license, again violated the law by obtaining an unlicensed gun was a means well-suited to the end of assuring that lawbreakers do not have firearms. Defendant's 3 1/2 year sentence was not draconian and did not raise constitutional problems. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Public Health Law &sect; 2808 (5) (c), which prohibits the withdrawal or transfer of residential health care facility equity or assets in an aggregate amount exceeding three percent of the facility's most recently reported annual revenue from patient care services without the prior approval of the State Commissioner of Health, does not violate the substantive due process property interests of facility owners. Economic regulation will violate an individual's substantive due process property interest only in those situations where there is absolutely no reasonable relationship to be perceived between the regulation and the achievement of a legitimate governmental purpose. The regulation here is not so outrageously arbitrary as to constitute a gross abuse of governmental authority, and plaintiffs have not met their extraordinary burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the challenged provision suffers wholesale constitutional impairment. The legislature's prescription of means, particularly in the arena of economic regulation, is entitled to judicial deference so long as those means are in a very broad sense reasonably related to the achievement of a permissible regulatory end. In employing the three percent threshold based on annual facility revenue, the legislature put in place a mechanism that would at once identify contemplated withdrawals sufficiently substantial to be of legitimate regulatory concern, and afford owners of facilities with positive net worth a measure of unregulated access to facility assets and equity. Moreover, nursing homes are with ample historical and practical justification pervasively regulated and, in that context particularly, the additional regulatory increment cannot be viewed as a constitutionally untoward assault upon the private property interests of facility owners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penal Law &sect;400.00 (3) (a) does not preclude an individual who owns a part-time residence in New York but makes his or her permanent domicile in another state from applying for a New York handgun license. Generally, establishing residence turns on whether one has a significant connection with some locality in the state as the result of living there for some length of time during the course of a year, whereas domicile requires a physical presence in a place with an intention to make the place a permanent home. Thus, an individual can have more than one residence, but only one domicile. Penal Law &sect;400.00 (3) (a) refers to the applicant's residence in the context of delineating the procedure whereby an individual files an application for a license, instructing the applicant to apply to the licensing officer in the city or county where he or she resides (or is principally employed, etc.). The plain language of the statute is not consistent with the theory that the law requires an applicant to establish domicile as an eligibility requirement. Moreover, the legislative history of the statutes that underlay Penal Law &sect; 400.00 evinces an intent to ensure that an applicant applies in his or her place of residence, rather than an intent to limit licenses to applicants who make their domicile in New York. The residency language was added in order to discourage forum-shopping. Most conclusively, Penal Law &sect; 400.00 itself contemplates that licenses may be issued to individuals who do not make their domicile in New York. Since a handgun license may be issued, under Penal Law &sect; 400.00 (7), to &quot;an alien, or to a person not a citizen of and usually a resident&quot; in New York State, it is clear that there is no requirement of domicile. </SPAN></P>

In unfair labor practice proceedings, an administrative law judge did not defer to the arbitrator, and the PERB agreed. The court of appeals held this was reasonable because (1) his findings on past practice under the Taylor Law fell outside his authority, (2) his decision as to past practice under the Taylor Law was repugnant to that statute, as he found no mutual understanding sufficient to establish a binding past practice, but a binding past practice under the Taylor Law did not require mutual understanding, and (3) he did not rule there was no past practice under the Taylor Law, as he only said historical practices did not show a contract right to reimbursement of the premiums. Substantial evidence supported PERB's decision because the district's statutory permission to reimburse the premiums, under N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, came from the definition of &quot;terms and conditions of employment&quot; (Civil Service Law &sect; 201(4)) and the bargaining right in certain binding past practices.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent Public Employment Relations Board's determination that petitioner School District had committed an improper employer practice by discontinuing petitioner's practice of reimbursing Medicare Part B premiums of certain retirees, made after the arbitrator in a related contract grievance arbitration ruled that petitioner was not contractually obligated to reimburse the premiums, was not based upon an error of law or arbitrary and capricious, and was supported by substantial evidence. In order for respondent in an improper practice proceeding to defer to an arbitration award it must be satisfied that the issues raised by the improper practice charge were fully litigated in the arbitration proceeding, that arbitral proceedings were not tainted by unfairness or serious procedural irregularities, and that the determination of the arbitrator was not clearly repugnant to the purposes and policies of the Taylor Law. It was reasonable for respondent not to defer to any finding of the arbitrator that there was no binding past practice under the Taylor Law: identity of issues was lacking and, to the extent the arbitrator purported to determine there was no past practice within the meaning of the Taylor Law, he exceeded his authority and his finding was repugnant to that statute. Moreover, respondent's decision in regard to past practice was supported by substantial evidence. Petitioner's knowledge of the payments was shown by the managerial oversight necessary to make them, as well as the memorandum circulated to its faculty and staff, announcing termination of petitioner's practice of reimbursing the premiums. Respondent Union's and bargaining unit employees' knowledge was established by the testimony given at the hearing.</SPAN></P>

Respondent Public Employment Relations Board, in determining that petitioner had committed an improper employer practice by discontinuing petitioner's practice of reimbursing Medicare Part B premiums of certain retirees, found that the practice was a binding past practice under the Taylor Law. Although school districts may not &quot;give or loan any money or property&quot; (NY Const, art VIII, &sect; 1) unless expressly authorized by law or pursuant to a contract term, the statutory permission here came from the definition of &quot;terms and conditions of employment&quot; (Civil Service Law &sect; 201 [4]) and the bargaining right in certain binding past practices. As respondent Union had the right to reimbursement under the Taylor Law, the reimbursement could not be an unconstitutional gift of public funds. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendant State of New York and others, challenging the constitutionality of the HAIL Act, a law regulating medallion taxicabs (or &quot;yellow cabs&quot;) and livery vehicles in New York City. The supreme court (New York) entered a judgment nullifying the HAIL Act, and declaring that it violated the municipal home rule, double enactment and exclusive privileges clauses of the New York Constitution. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the HAIL Act addressed a matter of substantial state concern. This was not a purely local issue. The Act bore a reasonable relationship to the substantial state interest of increasing the supply of accessible yellow cabs in New York City. Efficient transportation services in the state's largest city and international center of commerce was important to the entire state. The Act plainly furthered all of these significant goals. Because the Act addressed substantials state concerns and bore a reasonable relationship to those concerns, the supreme court erred in concluding that the Act violated the municipal home rule clause. The court rejected plaintiffs' arguments that the Act violated the double enactment clause. The Act did not violate the exclusive privileges clause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 602 of the Laws of 2011, as amended by chapter 9 of the Laws of 2012 (HAIL Act), which regulates medallion taxicabs and livery vehicles and addresses certain mobility deficiencies in the City of New York, does not violate NY Constitution, article IX, &sect; 2 (b) (2) (Municipal Home Rule Clause). Although the HAIL Act is a special law and the Municipal Home Rule Clause could be read to direct that a home rule message was required before the Act's enactment, there is an exception to that requirement where the State possesses a substantial interest in the subject matter and the enactment bears a reasonable relationship to the legitimate, accompanying substantial State concern. In addressing the lack of yellow cabs within the Manhattan central business district that are accessible to the disabled and the general shortage of available yellow cab and livery vehicle transportation in underserved areas of the City, the HAIL Act addresses a substantial state concern. Efficient transportation services in the State's largest city and international center of commerce are important to the entire State. Moreover, the Act bears a reasonable relationship to that substantial State concern. It consists of a series of interlocking provisions to address its stated purposes. The delegation of a portion of the Act's implementation to the Mayor pursuant to section 8 of the Act was within the State legislature's purview and did not transfer any of the City Council's powers to the Mayor. Section 9's requirement calling for the Taxi and Limousine Commission's establishment of a grant program to distribute up to $54 million in grants for the purchase or retrofitting of accessible HAIL vehicles does not interfere with the City Council's budgeting authority. Nor does section 23 of the Act, which requires that penalties for violations of the Act be transferred to the entity that issued the summons for a HAIL vehicle violation, intrude on the City's finances, as the City maintains control over the funds derived from its law enforcement entities that enforce the Act, while the New York State Police receive monies for the summonses they issue.  </SPAN></P>

Chapter 602 of the Laws of 2011, as amended by chapter 9 of the Laws of 2012 (HAIL Act), which regulates medallion taxicabs and livery vehicles and addresses certain mobility deficiencies in the City of New York, does not violate NY Constitution, article IX, &sect; 2 (b) (1) (Double Enactment Clause). It has not been demonstrated that the HAIL Act &quot;repealed, diminished, impaired or suspended&quot; any power in &quot;a statute of local governments&quot; so as to require reenactment and approval of the Act the year after it was enacted. The HAIL Act, which addresses the lack of yellow cabs within the Manhattan central business district that are accessible to the disabled and the general shortage of available yellow cab and livery vehicle transportation in underserved areas of the City, addresses a matter of substantial state concern and bears a reasonable relationship to that concern. The Double Enactment Clause is no more exacting on the limits of state power than the Municipal Home Rule Clause, which the Act does not violate.  </SPAN></P>

Chapter 602 of the Laws of 2011, as amended by chapter 9 of the Laws of 2012 (HAIL Act), which regulates medallion taxicabs and livery vehicles and addresses certain mobility deficiencies in the City of New York, does not violate NY Constitution, article III, &sect; 17 (Exclusive Privileges Clause). The Exclusive Privileges Clause, which targets monopolies, may only be violated if the private or local bill is directed at a single entity and it confers a privilege upon the single entity to the exclusion of all others. The HAIL Act's licensing provisions apply to a class consisting of close to 60,000 livery vehicle drivers and owners. Although the Act provides that within the first three years of the first issuance, HAIL licenses may be issued only to owners of for-hire vehicles or for-hire drivers who have been licensed by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) for at least one year and are in good standing with the TLC (HAIL Act &sect; 5 [b]), that does not limit the number of people who may obtain one. In order to qualify, all one needs to do is obtain a TLC license, operate a livery vehicle for one year and maintain good standing with the TLC. Thus, the number of persons who are able to obtain HAIL licenses will likely vary over time. That is not the type of &quot;exclusivity&quot; that the clause was meant to prohibit. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a contractor, its owner and employee, a contractors association, and a county, sued defendants, challenging an amendment to New York's Wicks Act. The trial court dismissed the case; plaintiffs appealed. The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, held that the county had standing, reinstated the complaint to the extent it sought declaratory relief, and declared the amendment constitutional. Plaintiffs sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed that the amendment violated N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 (the Home Rule section) by unjustifiably loosening Wicks Law restrictions to a greater extent for eight counties than for the other counties. The intermediate appellate court held that the county had standing to assert the Home Rule claim, but that that claim failed on the merits. The high court agreed. As the amendment related to both to the property and affairs of local governments and to a matter of substantial statewide concern--the manner of bidding on public construction contracts--N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 3(a)(3), as the high court had interpreted it, established that art. IX, &sect; 2(b)(2) did not prevent the State from enacting the amendment. However, the complaint's allegations that the apprenticeship provisions of Labor Law &sect; 222(2)(e) excluded out-of-state contractors from some public construction work in New York, in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Privileges and Immunities Clause and Commerce Clause, were sufficient to survive defendants' motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs' remaining causes of action were properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court modified the decision of the intermediate appellate court to reinstate plaintiffs' claims alleging that Labor Law &sect; 222(2)(e) violated the U.S. Constitution; as so modified, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Home Rule Powers -- Special Law Serving Substantial State Concern -- Concurrent Authority of State and Local Legislatures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Home Rule section of the State Constitution (art IX, &sect; 2 [b] [2]) does not require an examination into the reasonableness of the distinctions the legislature has made where it has enacted a law of statewide impact on a matter of substantial state concern but has not treated all areas of the state alike. While the language of article IX, &sect; 2 seems broadly to prohibit, in the absence of either a &quot;home rule message&quot; or a certificate of necessity from the governor, the enactment of any special law, i.e., one which applies to one or more, but not all, counties, in relation to the property, affairs or government of any local government, it was long ago recognized that there must be a sizeable area of overlap in which the state legislature acting by special law and local governments have concurrent powers. Article IX, &sect; 3 (a) (3) of the State Constitution, which provides that &quot;Except as expressly provided, nothing in this article shall restrict or impair any power of the legislature in relation to . . . [m]atters other than the property, affairs or government of a local government,&quot; is not a mere redundancy. A great deal of legislation relates both to &quot;the property, affairs or government of a local government&quot; and to &quot;[m]atters other than the property, affairs or government of a local government&quot;--i.e., to matters of substantial state concern. Where that is true, section 3 (a) (3), establishes that section 2 (b) (2) does not prevent the state from acting by special law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Home Rule Powers -- Special Law Serving Substantial State Concern -- Reasonableness Analysis Not Required -- Public Works Contracts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Amendments to the Wicks Law, which requires public entities seeking bids on construction contracts to obtain &quot;separate specifications&quot; for plumbing, electrical and HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) work where contract costs exceed a certain threshold amount, were not forbidden by the Home Rule section of the State Constitution (art IX, &sect; 2 [b]) notwithstanding that the amendments set differing monetary thresholds for the applicability of the Wicks Law for different counties (L 2008, ch 57, part MM, &sect;&sect; 1, 2-6, 14) and neither a &quot;home rule message&quot; nor a certificate of necessity from the governor accompanied the legislation. There is a sizeable area of overlap in which the state legislature and local governments have concurrent powers and where there is a matter of substantial state concern the State can act by special law. Inasmuch as it was obvious and undisputed that the manner of bidding on public construction contracts is a matter of substantial state concern, an examination into the reasonableness of the distinctions the legislature made by setting different contract cost thresholds for different counties was not required. The Home Rule provisions were intended to prevent unjustifiable state interference in matters of purely local concern and no such interference occurred here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Interstate Commerce -- Challenge to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Legislation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Favoring In-State over Out-of-State Contractors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. On a CPLR 3211 motion to dismiss, plaintiffs' complaint sufficiently alleged that the apprenticeship requirements in the second sentence of Labor Law &sect; 222 (2) (e), which requires contractors bidding on public construction contracts exceeding certain cost thresholds to &quot;participate in apprentice training programs in the trades of work it employs that have been approved by the department [of labor] for not less than three years and shall have graduated at least one apprentice in the last three years and shall have at least one apprentice currently enrolled in such apprenticeship training program,&quot; unconstitutionally excluded out-of-state contractors from some public construction work in New York. The Federal Commerce Clause has a &quot;dormant&quot; aspect, and along with the Privileges and Immunities Clause, limits the power of states to give preferential treatment to their own citizens. If the effect of the second sentence of section 222 (2) (e) is to exclude out-of-state contractors from bidding on certain New York contracts, both the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the dormant Commerce Clause would be violated. While defendants' contention that the challenged provision does not apply to all projects but only to those projects that are undertaken pursuant to project labor agreements is a reasonable one, and minimizes the constitutional problem, if section 222 (2) (e)&nbsp;unconstitutionally discriminates against out-of-state contractors, it is invalid whether it applies to many projects or to relatively few. From the face of the complaint, the statute and the relevant regulations, it could not be concluded that the apprenticeship requirements were not exclusionary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Substantive Due Process -- Amendments to Wicks Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Amendments to the Wicks Law which set differing monetary thresholds for the applicability of the law for different counties and establish apprenticeship requirements applicable to bidders for public contracts (L 2008, ch 57, part MM) did not deprive plaintiffs either of equal protection or of substantive due process under the Federal or State Constitution. The allegations of the complaint did not show that any provision of the amendments to the Wicks Law divided persons into classes, or deprived any person of property, without a rational basis, or that any such provision infringed any plaintiff's fundamental right or intentionally discriminated against a protected class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- Citizen Taxpayer Challenge to Amendments to Wicks Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge certain amendments to the Wicks Law which set differing monetary thresholds for the applicability of the law for different counties and establish apprenticeship requirements applicable to bidders for public contracts (L 2008, ch 57, part MM) pursuant to State Finance Law &sect; 123-b, which permits any &quot;citizen taxpayer&quot; to bring an action against a state officer or employee for causing &quot;a wrongful expenditure, misappropriation, misapplication, or . . . other illegal or unconstitutional disbursement of state funds.&quot; To the extent that plaintiffs' claims related to state expenditures, they were merely claims that state funds were not being spent wisely, not that it was illegal to spend money at all for the questioned activity. Accordingly, plaintiffs failed to allege a sufficient nexus to fiscal activities of the state to allow for section 123-b standing.</SPAN></P>

Amendments to General Municipal Law &sect; 959, L 2009, ch. 57, Part S-1, &sect; 3, introduced two new criteria that businesses were required to meet to retain their certificates of eligibility for the Program. The Legislature also required the New York Commissioner of Economic Development to review all certified businesses to determine if they were to be decertified under the new criteria, General Municipal Law &sect; 959(w). The businesses were certified under the Program and were issued certificates of eligibility. However, the certification of each of the businesses was revoked retroactively because of the amendments. The state high court found that the retroactive application of the amendments to the Program violated the right of the businesses to due process under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, 5 NYCRR 11.9(c), a regulation by the New York Department of Economic Development, did not conflict with the statutory directive in General Municipal Law &sect; 959 to consider the total performance of an Empire Zone business.</SPAN></P>

In five actions and proceedings challenging the retroactive application of certain amendments to General Municipal Law &sect; 959 (L 2009, ch 57, part S-1, &sect; 3) that introduced two new criteria that businesses must meet to retain their certificates of eligibility for the Empire Zones Program and its state tax incentives, plaintiffs' constitutional challenges to the retroactive application were valid Due Process Clause challenges. While the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause is but one of many constitutional provisions that express principles of antiretroactivity, plaintiffs' claims were not valid Takings Clause challenges, as characterized by the Appellate Division decisions. The test for whether a retroactive tax violates the Due Process Clause is different from the test for whether a retroactive tax is an unconstitutional taking. An aggrieved taxpayer may choose to make a claim that a retroactive tax violates the Due Process Clause under the multi-factor balancing-of-equities test set forth in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Replan Dev. v Department of Hous.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The retroactive application of certain amendments (the 2009 Amendments) to General Municipal Law &sect; 959 (L 2009, ch 57, part S-1, &sect; 3) that introduced two new criteria that businesses must meet to retain their certificates of eligibility for the Empire Zones Program and its state tax incentives violated the due process rights of plaintiffs, businesses which were certified under the Program and issued certificates of eligibility by the State prior to the retroactive application date of January 1, 2008. The three important factors in determining whether a retroactive tax infringes on a taxpayer's due process rights are the taxpayer's forewarning of a change in the legislation and the reasonableness of reliance on the old law, the length of the retroactive period, and the public purpose for retroactive application. The first factor weighed in favor of plaintiffs as they had no warning and no opportunity at any time in 2008 to alter their behavior in anticipation of the impact of the 2009 Amendments. In addition, the 2009 Amendments were not meant to cure an unintended error by the legislature, but rather to increase tax receipts for the state budget. Plaintiffs appeared to have conducted their business affairs in a manner consistent with existing Program requirements in 2008, justifiably relying on the receipt of the tax benefits that were then in effect. The second factor also benefitted plaintiffs since the length of retroactivity, regardless of whether the period of retroactivity was deemed to span 16 or 32 months, was excessive. Moreover, on the third factor, the State failed to set forth a valid public purpose for the retroactive application.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Defendant Department of Economic Development's decertification of plaintiff, a commercial real estate company that had obtained certification as an Empire Zone business in 2000, because plaintiff failed the 1:1 benefit-cost test based upon a review of the business annual reports (BARs) plaintiff had filed for 2001-2007, was not arbitrary and capricious. Although plaintiff maintained that its benefit-cost ratio would have been greater than 4:1 if its year 2000 investments were included in the State's evaluation, defendant rationally decided to tally investments beginning in 2001, the first full year of the Empire Zones Program. General Municipal Law &sect; 959 (w) states that defendant's decertification review would be based on at least three BARs that the business had prepared and filed with the Empire Zones Program. Defendant had promulgated regulations in 5 NYCRR 11.9 (c) (2) stating that it would review the BARs from the years 2001 to 2007. Defendant's regulation does not conflict with the statutory directive in General Municipal Law &sect; 959 to consider an Empire Zone business's total performance. The statute did not require that defendant look at all available BARs in making a decertification decision under the 1:1 test. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate initiated a hunger strike in order to secure transfer to another facility, among other things. After the order was issued by the trial court, the inmate resumed eating solid food but pursued an appeal of the order. The intermediate appellate court found that the inmate's claim that the State did not have the right to secure a force-feeding order was not moot, and ruled in favor of the department on the merits. The appellate court held that the intermediate appellate court did not err in applying the mootness exception. When a policy or regulation impinged on a prisoner's constitutional rights, the action was valid if it was reasonably related to legitimate penological interests. The trial court's order withstood scrutiny. Among other things, a prisoner hunger strike could have had a significant destabilizing impact on the institution, and a suicide could have had an agitating effect on other prisoners. The department had a duty under the Eighth Amendment to safeguard the lives of individuals in its institutions. The department had attempted less intrusive means without success.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding requesting a court order permitting medical personnel to insert a nasogastric tube and take other reasonable steps necessary to provide hydration and nutrition to respondent inmate, who was on a hunger strike, respondent's claim that the force-feeding order violated his constitutional right to refuse medical treatment was preserved for review. Although respondent did not reference the Due Process Clause or articulate his constitutional objections in the hearing court with the specificity and clarity that he did in the Appellate Division or in the Court of Appeals, that was a consequence of the fact that respondent addressed several arguments pro se, having been assigned counsel only shortly before the hearing, which was conducted expeditiously out of concern for preservation of his health. Respondent did argue that &quot;putting a tube in my nose, that's cruel and unusual punishment,&quot; and it was evident that he viewed the insertion of a nasogastric feeding tube as an unconstitutional invasion of his bodily integrity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Academic and Moot Questions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an appeal from an order permitting medical personnel to insert a nasogastric tube and take other reasonable steps necessary to provide hydration and nutrition to respondent inmate, who was on a hunger strike, the Appellate Division did not err in applying the mootness exception to respondent's claim that the force-feeding order violated his constitutional right to refuse medical treatment. Although respondent resumed eating solid food after the order was issued, the issue of a hunger-striking inmate's constitutional right to refuse medical treatment fell within the exception to the mootness rule since it was novel, likely to recur and, given the exigencies involved in addressing a hunger strike, would typically evade review. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and Prisoners -- Medical and Surgical Treatment -- Court-Ordered Forced Feeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a proceeding in which petitioner, the superintendent of a correctional facility, sought a court order permitting medical personnel to insert a nasogastric tube and take other reasonable steps necessary to provide hydration and nutrition to respondent inmate, who was on a hunger strike, respondent's claim that the force-feeding order violated his constitutional right to refuse medical treatment was properly rejected. Petitioner had sought a forced-feeding order because respondent's conduct, according to his doctor, had created a substantial risk of imminent death or serious permanent injury. Even assuming the constitutional right respondent asserted existed, and that petitioner's intervention therefore resulted in the curtailment of such a right, the propriety of petitioner's action would be valid if it was reasonably related to legitimate penological interests. Factors to consider under such a standard include the extent to which the right asserted by the inmate is compatible with incarceration; whether the challenged prison action or policy is consistent with the institutional interests that are cited to justify it; whether other means are available to the inmate to exercise the right in question; whether accommodation of the inmate's asserted right will adversely impact the prison population, employees or the allocation of prison resources; and whether, viewed in a pragmatic light, it is feasible for prison authorities to address their institutional concerns through other means. Applying that test, the order permitting petitioner to intervene to prevent respondent's death by feeding via nasogastric tube, if necessary, withstood scrutiny. Taking action to interrupt an inmate hunger strike not only serves to preserve life and prevent a suicide but also to maintain institutional order and security. Petitioner could not effectuate those interests other than by seeking a judicial order permitting feeding by nasogastric tube--less intrusive means had been attempted without success. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner city sued respondent union, seeking a permanent stay of arbitration of a dispute relating to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The trial court dismissed the suit. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, Second Department, reversed, and granted the petition, holding that Civil Service Law &sect; 201(4) and Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 470 barred the arbitration. The union appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the CBA, the city agreed to bear the cost of firefighters' pensions, pursuant to state law. The CBA ended in June 2009. The legislature enacted Retirement and Social Security Law art. 22, effective in 2010, which required new firefighters to contribute 3 percent of wages toward their pensions. The city then required firefighters who were hired after the CBA had ended to pay 3 percent of their wages towards their pensions. In response, the union filed an improper practice charge which led to the arbitration. Whether the arbitration was negotiation barred by &sect; 201(4) and &sect; 470 depended on whether the CBA was &quot;in effect&quot; under L 2009, ch. 504, pt. A, &sect; 8 when art. 22 became effective. The appellate court held that the part of the CBA that required non-contributory plans was rendered unlawful by art. 22. L 2009, ch. 504, pt. A, &sect; 8 made clear that the legislature did not intend to apply the exception to agreements that had expired and could only be deemed to continue through the Triborough Law, Civil Service Law &sect; 209-a(1)(e). The L 2009, ch. 504, pt. A, &sect; 8 exception did not apply to the CBA here. Thus, the arbitration was barred as an impermissible negotiation of benefits.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arbitration of respondent union's improper practice charge alleging that petitioner municipality erred in failing to apply the parties' collective bargaining agreement (CBA) and noncontributory pension benefits provision to firefighters hired after the CBA had expired was barred, as an impermissible negotiation of pension benefits, by Civil Service Law &sect; 201 (4) and Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 470. The parties' CBA had expired on June 30, 2009, and, in the absence of a successor CBA, the Triborough doctrine applied and the CBA's terms continued, unless contradicted by statute. The part of the CBA that required noncontributory plans was rendered unlawful by the enactment of Retirement and Social Security Law article 22 (L 2009, ch 504, part A), effective in January 2010, which prohibits such plans. The exception to the prohibition against noncontributory plans for CBAs &quot;in effect&quot; on the effective date of article 22, as set forth in section 8 of part A of chapter 504 of the Laws of 2009, did not apply to the parties' CBA, which had expired prior to article 22's effective date and was only deemed to continue through the Triborough doctrine (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Civil Service Law &sect; 209-a). The legislature, having set forth the section 8 exception for CBAs that are &quot;in effect,&quot; expressly stated that eligibility to join a CBA's retirement plan &quot;shall not apply upon termination of such agreement&quot; (L 2009, ch 504, part A, &sect; 8). That language and similar language in the Governor's Program Bill Memorandum in support of the legislation made clear that the legislature did not intend to apply the section 8 exception to CBAs that had expired and could only be deemed to continue through the Triborough doctrine. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that the Internet tax was unconstitutional on its face because it violated the Commerce Clause by subjecting online retailers, without a physical presence in the State, to New York sales and compensating use taxes. They also maintained that the Internet tax violated the Due Process Clause by creating an irrational, irrebuttable presumption of solicitation of business within the State. The appellate court held that the Internet tax was constitutional on its face, finding that the statute plainly satisfied the substantial nexus requirement. Active, in-state solicitation that produced a significant amount of revenue qualified as demonstrably more than a slightest presence. The bottom line was that if a vendor was paying New York residents to actively solicit business in the State, there was no reason why that vendor should not shoulder the appropriate tax burden. The appellate court would not strain to invalidate the statute where plaintiffs had not met their burden of establishing that it was facially invalid. The fact that plaintiffs could posit a potential constitutional infirmity did not require the statute's invalidation on its face.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Tax Law &sect; 1101 (b) (8) (vi) (the Internet tax), which subjects online vendors, without a physical presence in New York, to state sales and compensating use taxes if the vendors use in-state residents to solicit business in New York through the residents' websites, is facially valid under the Commerce Clause. The Internet tax is constitutional on its face under either standard for evaluating a facial challenge pursuant to the Commerce Clause--that there is &quot;no set of circumstances&quot; under which the statute would be valid, or the stricter test of whether the statute has a plainly legitimate sweep. The relevant inquiry is whether the tax is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state. Although an in-state physical presence is necessary, it need not be substantial, but demonstrably more than a slightest presence, and the presence requirement will be satisfied if economic activities are performed in New York by the seller's employees or on its behalf. The Internet tax statute satisfies the substantial nexus requirement, as active, in-state solicitation that produces a significant amount of revenue qualifies as demonstrably more than a slightest presence. Further, although not a dispositive factor, vendors are not required to pay the taxes out-of-pocket. Rather, they are collecting taxes that are due, which are exceedingly difficult to collect from the individual purchasers themselves, and as to which there is no risk of multiple taxation. The statutory language allows for a range of possible types of compensation, which would include flat fee arrangements, and although a substantial nexus would be lacking if New York residents were merely engaged to post passive advertisements on their websites, a vendor paying New York residents to actively solicit business in New York should shoulder the appropriate tax burden.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Tax Law &sect; 1101 (b) (8) (vi) (the Internet tax), which subjects online vendors, without a physical presence in New York, to state sales and compensating use taxes if the vendors use in-state residents to solicit business in New York through the residents' websites, is facially valid under the Due Process Clause. An in-state physical presence is not required in order to satisfy due process. Instead, the focus is on whether a party has purposefully directed its activities toward the forum state and whether it is reasonable, based on the extent of a party's contacts with that state and the benefits derived from such access, to require it to collect taxes for that state. The Internet tax statute says that a seller &quot;shall be presumed to be soliciting business through an independent contractor or other representative&quot; if it enters an agreement under which a New York resident, &quot;for a commission or other consideration, directly or indirectly refers potential customers, whether by a link on an internet website or otherwise.&quot; The statutory presumption is not irrational or irrebuttable. It is rational to presume that, given the direct correlation between referrals and compensation, it is likely that residents will seek to increase their referrals by soliciting customers. More specifically, it is not unreasonable to presume that affiliated website owners residing in New York State will reach out to their New York friends, relatives and other local individuals in order to accomplish this purpose. Moreover, the agency charged with enforcing the statute has expressly acknowledged that mere advertising is beyond the scope of the provision, and it has set forth a method (contractual prohibition and annual certification) through which the retailers will be deemed to have rebutted the presumption. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a fight between defendant and his gang members and a rival gang member and his companions, defendant fired five bullets from a handgun. Three shots hit one of the rivals and paralyzed him. A 10-year-old girl was shot in the head and died. The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that the evidence at trial failed to demonstrate that defendant and his fellow gang members committed the acts against the rival gang member and his companions with the conscious objective of intimidating every Mexican-American in the territory identified at trial. The Legislature did not intend for the crime of terrorism to cover the illegal acts of a gang member committed for the purpose of coercing or intimidating adversaries. Accordingly, the evidence was insufficient to establish defendant's guilt under &sect; 490.25. Consequently, without the aura of terrorism looming over the case, the volume of proof regarding unrelated assaults, murders, and other offenses created a reasonable possibility that the jury's findings were prejudicially influenced.

In the prosecution of defendant gang member for crimes of terrorism predicated upon his alleged commission of manslaughter in the first degree and other crimes during a gang-related fight in which a rival gang member and a young girl were shot, the acts perpetrated by defendant did not demonstrate an &quot;intent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population&quot; within the meaning of Penal Law &sect; 490.25 (1) on the theory that there was an objective to intimidate or coerce the entire Mexican-American community. Even assuming that all of the Mexican-Americans in the area of the Bronx where the gang operated could be considered a &quot;civilian population,&quot; the evidence at trial failed to demonstrate that defendant and his fellow gang members committed the criminal acts with the conscious objective of intimidating everyone in that population. Instead, the evidence demonstrated that the gang members arranged the attack because of a man's assumed membership in a rival gang and his refusal to comply with the gang's demand that he leave a party. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Terrorism -- Intent to Intimidate or Coerce Civilian Population</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the prosecution of defendant gang member for crimes of terrorism predicated upon his alleged commission of manslaughter in the first degree and other crimes during a gang-related fight in which a rival gang member and a young girl were shot, the acts perpetrated by defendant were not acts of terrorism within the meaning of Penal Law article 490 and therefore the evidence was insufficient to establish defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. While the jury could have concluded that one of defendant's goals in committing the crimes was to intimidate or coerce another gang, the legislative findings in Penal Law article 490 clearly demonstrate that the legislature was not extending the reach of the terrorism statute to cover gang-on-gang street crimes. Penal Law &sect; 490.00 cites seven notorious acts of terrorism, including the September 11, 2001 attacks, that serve as guideposts for determining whether a future incident constitutes a terroristic act. In addition, the definitional provisions of article 490 were drawn from federal antiterrorism statutes designed to criminalize acts such as detonation of bombs in cities or deliberate assassinations of persons to strike fear and deter individuals from exercising their rights. The concept of terrorism has a unique meaning and its implications risk being trivialized if the terminology is applied loosely in situations that do not match the collective understanding of what constitutes a terrorist act.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Trial -- Effect of Error as to Certain Counts on Other Jointly Tried Counts</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a prosecution where defendant's convictions for crimes of terrorism predicated on first-degree manslaughter, attempted second-degree murder and second-degree weapon possession and for second-degree conspiracy for agreeing to commit first-degree gang assault as a crime of terrorism were based on insufficient evidence, defendant was entitled to a new trial on the underlying offenses specified in the terrorism counts. An error in the proceedings relating to one count requires reversal of convictions on other jointly tried counts if there is a reasonable possibility that the jury's decision to convict on the tainted counts influenced its guilty verdict on the remaining counts in a meaningful way. By proceeding on the terrorism theory, the People were able to introduce evidence about numerous alleged criminal acts committed by members of defendant's gang over the course of three years, which evidence would have otherwise been largely inadmissible. Thus, there was a reasonable possibility that the jury's findings were prejudicially influenced. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order by the Appellate Division (New York) that affirmed his adjudication as a second violent felony offender, based upon a 1999 Pennsylvania conviction; defendant claimed, among other things, that, because he could have been accorded youthful offender status had he committed that crime in New York, he was entitled to such status for the purpose of enhanced sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant also argued that Penal Law &sect; 70.04(1)(b)(v), the provision that tolled the 10-year look-back period while a person was incarcerated, violated the equal protection laws of the New York State Constitution. The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that at the time of the 1999 conviction, defendant, then 18 years old, was not entitled to youthful offender status pursuant to Pennsylvania laws. Therefore, as defendant did not receive youthful offender treatment for the underlying offense, he was not now entitled to a retroactive application of youthful offender status to the foreign felony conviction. Accordingly, the trial court properly assigned the same status to the underlying conviction as did the foreign jurisdiction in which the conviction had been entered. It was not irrational for the Legislature, in &sect; 70.04(1)(b)(iv), to omit periods of incarceration from the 10-year look-back period, in order to assess whether a prior violent felon has abstained from a repeat offense within a 10-year period. Therefore, the statute did not violate defendant's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Second Violent Felony Offender -- Lack of Youthful Offender Status for Predicate Foreign Conviction </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was properly adjudicated as a second violent felony offender, predicated upon a prior foreign burglary conviction that occurred when he was 18 years old, notwithstanding that had he committed the crime in New York, he would have been eligible for consideration as a youthful offender, and, if so adjudicated, it could not have been used as a predicate conviction. A prior adjudication as a youthful offender--whether it occurred in New York or another jurisdiction--cannot serve as the basis for multiple offender sentencing provided the foreign youthful offender adjudication is similar to and consistent with New York's youthful offender treatment. However, youthful offender status cannot be retroactively assigned to underlying convictions of foreign jurisdictions even though, had the crimes been committed in New York, such consideration could have been granted. Mere speculation that defendant might have been accorded youthful offender treatment had the predicate offense been committed in New York cannot preclude the use of such a conviction as a predicate felony where such treatment was not and could not have been accorded by the jurisdiction in which the crime was actually committed. Accordingly, the sentencing court properly assigned the same status to the underlying conviction as did the foreign jurisdiction in which the conviction had been entered.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Second Violent Felony Offender -- Tolling Provision -- Exclusion of Period of Incarceration Not Denial of Equal Protection </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Penal Law &sect; 70.04 (1) (b) (v), which excludes all periods of incarceration from the 10-year enhanced sentencing look-back period between sentencing for the prior felony and commission of the present felony, does not violate the Equal Protection Clause on the ground that repeat offenders with lengthy sentences may receive harsher punishments than repeat offenders with lesser sentences or no periods of incarceration. While the tolling provision, as applied to persons with differing years of incarceration, may result in disparate punishment, there is no equal protection violation under the New York State Constitution, which does not mandate absolute equality of treatment but merely prescribes that, absent a fundamental interest or suspect classification, a legislative classification be rationally related to a legitimate state purpose. Given the absence of a suspect class or a fundamental right at issue, the statutory provision need only be supported by some rational basis to survive constitutional scrutiny. Inasmuch as recidivism evidences a lack of rehabilitation and a greater danger to society, it was not irrational for the Legislature to omit periods of incarceration from the 10-year look-back period. Rather, it was rational to omit periods of incarceration from the look-back period because society has an interest in treating differently individuals who demonstrate good behavior during the time in which they are released and living in society from those who cannot. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer claimed that the Legislature intended to give the adult entertainment business a tax break because the exotic stage and couch dances that were featured at the premises qualified as musical arts performances, rather than as more generalized amusement or entertainment activities that fell within the broad sweep of the tax. The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that the taxpayer's expert testimony was compromised by her opinion that the private performances were the same as the main stage performances despite the fact that she neither observed nor had personal knowledge of what occurred in the private areas. It was not irrational for the Tax Appeals Tribunal to conclude that performances by women gyrating on a pole to music, however artistic or athletic their practiced moves were, was not a qualifying performance entitled to exempt status. Consequently, the charges and fees failed to qualify for the exemption in, and were taxable under, &sect; 1105(f)(1). The taxpayer's remaining constitutional argument was unavailing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operator of an adult &quot;juice bar&quot; failed to meet its burden of proof that a sales tax exemption applied to admission charges and private dance performance fees it collected from patrons. The sales tax is broadly applied to &quot;[a]ny admission charge&quot; in excess of 10% for use of &quot;any place of amusement,&quot; with an exception for charges pertaining to &quot;dramatic or musical arts performances&quot; (Tax Law &sect; 1105 [f] [1]), and in order for petitioner to be entitled to the exclusion it was required to prove that the fees constituted admission charges for performances that were dance routines qualifying as choreographed performances. Petitioner failed to meet this burden as it related to the fees collected for &quot;private room&quot; performances as none of the evidence presented depicted such performances, and petitioner's expert's opinion was not based on any personal knowledge or observation of those performances. Furthermore, it was not arbitrary, capricious or an error of law for respondent Tax Appeals Tribunal to find that petitioner had failed to meet the same burden as it pertained to the admission charges for stage performances since respondent discredited the petitioner's expert's opinion that the routines qualified as choreographed performances, a determination well within respondent's province. It is not irrational for the Tax Tribunal to decline to extend a tax exemption to every act that declares itself a &quot;dance performance.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant federal credit union (FCU) appealed a judgment entered by the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, New York, which affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the FCU's action against defendants, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, its Commissioner, and the State of New York (defendants), which sought a declaration that the FCU was exempted from the mortgage recording tax (MRT) imposed by Tax Law &sect; 253.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that if federal credit union mortgages were intended to be excluded from MRTs, such immunity would have been stated in the Federal Credit Union Act, specifically 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1768. &quot;Property&quot; in &sect; 1768 could not be construed broadly to encompass mortgage loans. Congress could not have intended &sect; 1768 to exempt the mortgage loans since when the provision was enacted, credit unions could not issue such loans. When Congress granted FCUs the power to offer residential mortgages, it did not amend &sect; 1768 to include mortgages, or articulate an intent to include mortgages in the property exempt from state taxation. There was little danger that the MRT would drive FCUs out of business. The claim that the FCU was a federal instrumentality entitled to exemption from the MRT under the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, was rejected. FCUs were private associations chartered under federal law. They were wholly owned, funded and managed by their members, and were not so closely connected to the federal government that they could not be viewed as separate entities with respect to mortgage-lending activities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Mortgage Recording Tax -- Applicability to Mortgage Loans Issued by Federal Credit Unions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Federal credit unions are not exempt from the New York State mortgage recording tax under Tax Law article 11. The Federal Credit Union Act (FCUA), authorizing the formation of federal credit unions, contains an extensive list of tax exemptions for federal credit unions such as plaintiff (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;12 USC &sect; 1768), but makes no mention of mortgages or loans of any kind. Federal tax exemptions in derogation of state taxing authority are, as a general rule, strictly construed and not extended beyond their express provisions. Although section 1768 does provide that the &quot;property&quot; of federal credit unions is exempt, that term does not encompass mortgage loans. Federal credit unions were not empowered to issue mortgage loans to their members when the FCUA was enacted and subsequently amended so as to add the exemption provisions at issue, and therefore Congress could not have intended section 1768 to exempt from state taxation the issuance of mortgage loans. When Congress finally granted federal credit unions the power to offer residential mortgages, it did not amend section 1768 to specifically include &quot;mortgages,&quot; nor did it otherwise articulate an intent to include mortgages within the definition of the &quot;property&quot; exempt from state taxation. Moreover, permitting the mortgage recording tax to apply to federal credit unions does not thwart the FCUA's purpose and would not have serious financial ramifications for federal credit unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Mortgage Recording Tax -- Applicability to Mortgage Loans Issued by Federal Credit Unions -- Supremacy Clause</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff federal credit union was not a federal instrumentality entitled to exemption from the New York State mortgage recording tax under the Supremacy Clause. Constitutional tax immunity is appropriate only when the levy falls on the United States itself, or on an agency or instrumentality so closely connected to the United States Government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities, at least insofar as the activity being taxed is concerned. Federal credit unions are private associations chartered under federal law, and although they are regulated by a federal agency, they are wholly owned, funded and managed by their members. Members elect credit union boards of directors, and those directors have a significant amount of autonomy in administering credit unions' daily operations. Accordingly, federal credit unions are not so closely connected to the United States Government that they cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities with respect to mortgage-lending activities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the town created zoning districts for below-market-rate private housing for senior citizens and first-time home-buyers, SDHR filed an administrative complaint alleging that the town's actions denied housing to persons based on their race, color, and national origin, in violation of art. 15. Without waiting for the completion of SDHR's investigation, the town commenced the underlying action. The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that SDHR's allegation that the town's residency preferences amounted to discrimination and the town's claim that it would be &quot;reverse discrimination&quot; to eliminate the residency preferences required the resolution of factual issues at the administrative level before they could be passed upon by a court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney brought a CPLR art. 78 proceeding seeking to annul a determination of respondent administrative judge and seeking a judgment that he be paid for legal services rendered in accordance with a county court's order. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, Fourth Department, granted the petition in part, holding that the judge exceeded the authority conferred by 22 NYCRR 127.2 (b). The administrative judge appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney sought payment for legal work done on a homicide case. The county court granted the attorney's motion, concluding that the extraordinary circumstances of the criminal matter justified, and in fact, necessitated, the assignment of a &quot;second chair&quot; to assure that defendant received effective assistance of counsel. Pursuant to 22 NYCRR 127.2 (b), the county made an application to the administrative judge seeking review of the county court's order directing that the attorney be awarded legal fees. The administrative judge found that it was beyond the purview of county court, in contravention of County Law &sect; 722-b, to appoint the attorney as he never timely applied to be appointed for the assigned counsel program nor was he qualified to be appointed as a second-seated counsel in this matter. The appellate court found that the administrative judge exceeded the authority conferred by 22 NYCRR 127.2 (b) by considering the order of assignment. 22 NYCRR 127.2 (b), which was notably silent on the issue of assignment, only empowered administrative judges to assess the amount of compensation awarded, permitting a reduction of awards deemed excessive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney and Client -- Assignment of Counsel -- Administrative Judge Not Authorized to Review Validity of Assignment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent Administrative Judge exceeded the authority conferred upon him by 22 NYCRR 127.2 (b) by considering the validity of the County Court order that retroactively assigned petitioner attorney, under County Law article 18-B, to a criminal proceeding, and vacating the order of assignment. Any objection to County Court's determination should have been raised through a CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking a writ of prohibition. Section 127.2 (b), which is notably silent on the issue of assignment, only empowers administrative judges to assess the amount of compensation awarded, permitting a reduction of awards deemed excessive. Certain distinctions between the nature of assigning and compensating counsel warrant different avenues of review. Appellate review of compensation orders is impractical as appellate courts are too removed to assess the propriety of the trial court's discretionary decision-making in fixing compensation. Recognition of such impracticability led to the amendment of section 127.2 (b) so as to provide for review of compensation orders by an administrative judge. An allegation concerning a trial court's overreach, however, raises judicial or quasi-judicial issues amenable to judicial review under CPLR 7803 (2), which is suited for instances where &quot;the body or officer proceeded, is proceeding or is about to proceed without or in excess of jurisdiction.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants brought a special proceeding against, among others, respondent governor, seeking a declaration that L 2012, ch. 16, insofar as it expanded the size of the New York state senate from 62 to 63 districts, was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the legislature's failure to apply a consistent method of calculating the number of senate seats due to population growth was arbitrary and violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 4. Nassau County-which did not exist in 1894 and which now had the population to warrant three full ratios- was treated as if it had been a county in existence in 1894. Thus, the method of rounding down before combining was used for Nassau and Queens to determine the seats attributable to each county. For Richmond and Suffolk Counties, which both existed in 1894 and were combined into a single district at that time, the legislature continued its practice of using the method of combining before rounding down. The appellate court held that consistent application of one method of calculation was not required, given the Constitution's silence on the issue and the fact that the legislature had to be accorded a measure of discretion in these matters. Under the circumstances, appellants failed to demonstrate that the use of two constitutionally adequate means of determining the number of senate seats, in the course of addressing two discrete historical contexts, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a special proceeding seeking a declaration that chapter 16 of the Laws of 2012, insofar as it expands the size of the New York State Senate from 62 to 63 districts, was unconstitutional, petitioners failed to satisfy their burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of the legislation.&nbsp;Article III, &sect; 4 of the New York Constitution prescribes a &quot;ratio&quot; process to determine the required number of State Senate seats whereby the population of the State's citizens, as determined by the latest census, is divided by 50 to determine the ratio figure. Any county with three full ratios is allocated a Senate seat for each full ratio and if the number of seats assigned is greater than the number of seats assigned to that county in the Constitution of 1894, the increase is added to the original 50 Senate seats. However, the Constitution does not provide guidance for determining the proper ratio for counties that were divided after 1894 or combined in 1894 within a single Senate district. The Legislature has, in the past, employed two different methods, combining county populations before the ratio calculation or calculating the ratios for each county before combining the resulting figures, both of which have been recognized by the Court of Appeals, and both of which were used by the Legislature in 2012 with respect to different county pairs. Although the Legislature used one method for Queens and Nassau Counties and a different method for Richmond and Suffolk Counties, petitioners did not meet their burden of demonstrating that the use of two constitutionally adequate means of determining the number of Senate seats, in the course of addressing two discrete historical contexts, was unconstitutional. Consistent application of one method of calculation was not required, given the Constitution's silence on the issue and the Court's past recognition that the Legislature must be accorded a measure of discretion in these matters.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's motion to suppress his intercepted phone calls was denied, he was convicted of first-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance and second-degree conspiracy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police obtained an eavesdropping warrant allowing them to intercept the cellphone calls of a drug-dealer; defendant was another target of the warrant. Defendant moved to suppress the intercepted phone calls on the ground that the prosecution had failed to give him timely notice of the warrant as required by CPL 700.50(3). The high court held that the prosecution's failure to notify defendant of the warrant until over 90 days after it expired violated &sect; 700.50(3). However, defendant received notice of the warrant at arraignment, in accordance with CPL 700.70, and did not show any prejudice resulting from the lack of pre-arraignment notice. Accordingly, his motion to suppress was properly denied. Defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the constitutionality of the sentence, as such a challenge would not have succeeded, since it could not be inferred that defendant was further penalized by the trial court for pleading not guilty and insisting on his right to a trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Eavesdropping Warrants -- Suppression of Wiretap Evidence Based on Lack of Notice Not Warranted without Showing of Prejudice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A defendant seeking to suppress wiretap evidence based on the prosecution's violation of CPL 700.50 (3), which requires that written notice be given to a person named in an eavesdropping warrant within 90 days of the termination of the warrant, must show prejudice resulting from the lack of prearraignment notice to prevail on the suppression motion. While the penalty for a violation of the statute is generally suppression, as is required in a sister provision applicable to defendants who have been arraigned (CPL 700.70), suppression is not required, despite the prosecution's violation of the terms of CPL 700.50 (3), when the defendant independently knew of an eavesdropping warrant within the prescribed time period. This rationale implicitly rests on the premise that suppression should not be ordered for a CPL 700.50 (3) violation where there is no prejudice to the defendant. Here defendant was notified at his arraignment, in accordance with CPL 700.70, that he had been a subject of an eavesdropping warrant during which telephone calls were intercepted, and since no prejudice resulting from the lack of prearraignment notice was shown, suppression of defendant's statements was properly denied.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Counsel -- Effective Representation -- Failure to Challenge Constitutionality of Sentence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a drug prosecution, defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective where, at his sentencing, counsel failed to challenge the constitutionality of the sentence in light of the disparity between the penalties suffered by defendant and his criminal associate, who had entered into a cooperation agreement with a prosecutor. Such a challenge would not have been &quot;a winning argument,&quot; and it could not be inferred that defendant was punished or further penalized by the sentencing Justice because he pleaded not guilty and insisted upon his right to a trial. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent psychiatrists brought a declaratory judgment/CPLR art. 78 suit against appellant department, seeking a declaration that they were entitled to full Medicaid reimbursement and seeking full payment of coinsurance amounts after April 1, 2007, and challenging certain legislation as improperly retroactive. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, Second Department, modified the trial court's dismissal. The department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The psychiatrists argued that the 2006 amendment to former Social Services Law &sect; 367-a(1)(d)(iii) provided for 100 percent reimbursement for psychiatrists beginning on April 1, 2007 and had set no termination date. The intermediate appellate court found some claims time barred and held that the amendment imposed a continuing duty on the department to reimburse psychiatrists who performed services for dual eligibles at 100 percent after March 31, 2007. The appellate court found, however, that the intent of the legislature in the 2006 amendment to former &sect; 367-a(1)(d)(iii) was for the enhanced payments to psychiatrists to be temporary and only applied to the 2006-2007 fiscal year. The psychiatrists' reading would have created fiscal consequences extending far into future years, while department's proposed construction was the better reading of the statute as it comported with the legislative purpose that prompted the enactment-a temporary, one-year, coinsurance enhancement program to benefit psychiatrists. The psychiatrists' argument that there was no need to amend former &sect; 367-a(1)(d)(iii) was unavailing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- Medicare Reimbursement Payments -- Coinsurance Enhancement for Psychiatrists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2006 amendment to Social Services Law &sect; 367-a (1) (d) (iii) for the purpose of including psychiatrists who treat patients eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (dual eligibles) on the list of itemized providers that would receive 100% reimbursement was intended only to provide for a one-time co-insurance enhancement, limited to the 2006-2007 fiscal year. In New York, claims for medical care for dual eligibles are first submitted to the Medicare Part B program and the balance, i.e., the deductible and the coinsurance amount, is paid by Medicaid. Prior to 2003, Medicaid paid 100% of this balance amount to providers, but in 2003 Social Services Law &sect; 367-a (1) (d) was amended to curtail the deductible and coinsurance payments for the majority of providers, including psychiatrists, to 20%. In a 2006 budget bill, Social Services Law &sect; 367-a (1) (d) (iii) was amended so as to include psychiatrists on the list of providers covered at 100% (L 2006, ch 109, part C, &sect; 1), and, in the same budget bill, set forth the methodology for the provision of the &quot;2006-2007 coinsurance enhancement&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">id</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &sect; 2) that included a $2 million distribution cap. The placement of the amendment creating an enhancement program for psychiatrists in a budget bill and the inclusion of a methodology for its implementation immediately following clearly indicated that the Legislature intended for the coinsurance enhancement to be a one-time enhancement limited to the 2006-2007 fiscal year only. The Legislature had amended Social Services Law &sect; 367-a (1) (d) (iii) in precisely the same manner in 2005 in order to implement a similar enhancement for physicians. Moreover, the mechanism set forth in section 2 of the Laws of 2006, chapter 109, part C clearly refers to the amendment set forth in section 1, indicating that the amendment was not to be read separately from the paragraph that follows. The subsequent 2008 amendment to Social Services Law &sect; 367-a (1) (d) (iii) so as to remove the reference to psychiatrists altogether was not a substantive change in the law, but merely confirmed the legislative intent of the 2006 amendment, resolving the dispute over the meaning of the amendment that had arisen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the Appellate Term (New York), which affirmed defendant's conviction for criminal possession of marihuana in the fifth degree in violation of Penal Law  &sect; 221.10(1). Defendant argued that the accusatory instrument was jurisdictionally deficient because it failed to adequately allege that he was in a &quot;public place&quot; within the meaning of Penal Law &sect; 240.00(1) and that the marihuana was  &quot;open to public view.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found in possession of marihuana during a motor vehicle stop on a public street. The court of appeals held that the allegations in the information were sufficient to supply a jurisdictionally adequate accusatory instrument. For purposes of the Penal Law &sect; 240.00(1) definition of &quot;public place,&quot; the fact that defendant was in his personal automobile did not alter the fact that he was on a highway, and therefore, in a public place, when he was seen in possession of marihuana. A person was in a public place when located on a highway even if he or she was inside a personal automobile. The allegations in the information were jurisdictionally sufficient to provide reasonable cause to believe that the marihuana was open to public view. The accusatory instrument alleged that upon approaching the vehicle, the officer smelled a strong odor of marihuana emanating from inside the vehicle and observed defendant holding a quantity of marihuana in his hand. Additional allegations indicated that the contraband was in a zip lock bag. The allegations supported the inference that any other member of the public could also have seen the marihuana from the same vantage point.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Plea of Guilty -- Forfeiture of Right to Raise Issues on Appeal -- Jurisdictional Sufficiency of Accusatory Instrument</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant forfeited most appellate claims by pleading guilty to fifth-degree criminal possession of marihuana but he retained the right to challenge the jurisdictional sufficiency of the accusatory instrument charging him with that crime because a valid and sufficient accusatory instrument is a nonwaivable jurisdictional prerequisite to criminal prosecution. Since defendant did not waive the right to be tried for that misdemeanor offense by information, his claim of jurisdictional insufficiency must be assessed based on the standards governing an information, which is valid for jurisdictional purposes if it contains nonconclusory factual allegations that, if assumed to be true, address each element of the crime charged, thereby affording reasonable cause to believe that defendant committed that offense. Although an information should also be based on nonhearsay allegations, a purported hearsay defect in an accusatory instrument is nonjurisdictional and, thus, forfeited by a guilty plea. However, defendant did not rely on hearsay deficiencies, but argued that the accusatory instrument failed to include sufficient nonconclusory factual allegations relating to two elements of the charged offense, a claim that would, if meritorious, be jurisdictional in nature.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Controlled Substances -- Possession of Marihuana -- Automobile as &quot;Public Place&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An information charging defendant with criminal possession of marihuana in the fifth degree (Penal Law &sect; 221.10 [1]) for possession of marihuana while in his vehicle on a public street adequately alleged the element of that crime requiring possession in a &quot;public place.&quot; The definition of &quot;public place&quot; was incorporated by reference from Penal Law &sect; 240.00 (1), which includes &quot;highways&quot; as public places. That defendant was in his personal automobile did not alter the fact that he was on a highway and, therefore, in a public place when he was seen in possession of marihuana. The question is not whether a person's automobile is &quot;public&quot; or &quot;private&quot; but whether defendant was in a public place when he was in his car on the street. A driver of a personal automobile will be in a public place only when the vehicle is in a location that qualifies under the statute as a public place. In contrast, by defining certain vehicles used for public transportation--such as a bus--as themselves constituting &quot;public places,&quot; the Legislature made the location of those vehicles at the time of the crime irrelevant; they are &quot;public places&quot; whether they are being driven on a highway or are parked in a private parking lot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Controlled Substances -- Possession of Marihuana -- Marihuana &quot;Open to Public View&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An information charging defendant with criminal possession of marihuana in the fifth degree (Penal Law &sect; 221.10 [1]), alleging that a police officer observed the defendant holding a quantity of marihuana in his hand while defendant was in his vehicle on a public street, included sufficient nonconclusory allegations relating to the element of the crime requiring the marihuana to be burning or open to public view. A determination that a particular item is &quot;open to public view,&quot; a term that is not specifically defined, does not require the exercise of professional skill or experience on the part of a police officer warranting a specialized explanation. Thus, the basis for such an allegation could be discerned by drawing reasonable inferences from all the facts set forth in the accusatory instrument. Here, the accusatory instrument alleged that, upon approaching the vehicle, the officer &quot;smelled a strong odor of marihuana emanating from inside ... the vehicle&quot; and &quot;observed the defendant holding a quantity of marihuana in [his] hand, open to public view.&quot; Additional allegations indicated that the contraband was in a ziplock bag. Although the officer did not describe the precise location of defendant's hand, since she was standing outside the vehicle when she saw the substance in the ziplock bag, those allegations supported the inference that any other member of the public could also have seen the marihuana from the same vantage point--meaning that the marihuana was in an unconcealed area of the vehicle that would have been visible to a passerby or other motorist. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner detainee filed a CPLR art. 70 proceeding against respondents for a writ of habeas corpus in which he challenged the propriety of setting a single form of bail under CPL 520.10(2)(b). The habeas court dismissed his petition, and the New York Appellate Division affirmed. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After petitioner was indicted, his bail was set at $20,000, cash only. He later tried to secure a bail bond but was unable to do so because the trial court had designated bail as cash only. The court held that CPL 520.10(2)(b) prohibited a court from fixing only one form of bail. Providing flexible bail alternatives to pretrial detainees was consistent with the underlying purpose of CPL art. 520. The legislation was intended to reform the restrictive bail scheme that existed in the former Code of Criminal Procedure in order to improve the availability of pretrial release. The statute imposed no undue restriction on a court that believed a substantial personal undertaking was necessary to secure the defendant's court attendance in future proceedings. Hence, there did not appear to have been a compelling need for the legislature to authorize a single form of bail in CPL 510.20(2)(b). As for cases in which a court decided to order $1 cash bail, such bail was ordered for the benefit of the accused. It would take little judicial effort in such a situation to order another form of bail, which now had to be done routinely to properly comply with the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the Appellate Division, converted the proceeding to a declaratory judgment action, and granted judgment declaring that CPL 520.10(2)(b) prohibited the designation of one form of bail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Academic and Moot Questions -- Legality of Form of Bail Challenged after Defendant's Guilty Plea</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An appeal of an order denying petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus, in which petitioner challenged the authority of Supreme Court to set cash bail as the only available form of bail, did not became moot after petitioner entered a guilty plea to various offenses. Although the legality of his pretrial detention was technically no longer germane since that custody was terminated as a result of petitioner's plea, the mootness exception applied because the propriety of cash-only bail was an important issue that was likely to recur and which typically would evade review. Accordingly, the appeal was not dismissed and the proceeding was converted into a declaratory judgment action given that petitioner no longer needed affirmative habeas corpus relief.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bail -- Right to Bail -- More than One Form of Bail Required</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. CPL 520.10 (2) (b) prohibits a court from fixing only one form of bail. The statute states that a &quot;court may direct that the bail be posted in any one of two or more of the forms&quot; and thus requires that at least two forms of bail be ordered. Prohibiting only one form of bail comports with the overall statutory structure and the legislative purpose that prompted the enactment of CPL 520.10. The word &quot;may&quot; did not grant a court discretion to impose only one type of bail, rather its inclusion in both subdivision (2) (a) and (b) of CPL 520.10 was the simplest way for the Legislature to codify the two permissible methods of fixing bail: either by ordering a specific amount of bail without stating any particular bail form, or by specifying the forms of bail and giving the defendant at least two alternative choices. Providing flexible bail alternatives to pretrial detainees, who are presumptively innocent, is consistent with the underlying purpose of CPL article 520, which was to reform the restrictive bail scheme that had existed in the former Code of Criminal Procedure in order to improve the availability of pretrial release. Since a court may set multiple forms of bail in differing amounts, which, in effect, may be virtually indistinguishable from the cash option, there did not appear to have been a compelling need for the Legislature to authorize a single form of bail. </SPAN></P>

The former parishioners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former parishioners argued that the decision to demolish the church building had to be authorized by the parishioners, who they claimed were members of the church corporation pursuant to Religious Corporations Law &sect; 5. The appellate court found this argument unavailing. Applying the neutral principles of law doctrine, no such right or authority was reserved for the benefit of the parishioners. Pursuant to the by-laws, the parishioners were members of the ecclesiastical body-not members of a corporation. Such status did not confer on them the rights and duties as members of the religious corporation. Nor did the former parishioners point to any statute, corporate governance document, church canon, or other provision that identified current or former parishioners as members of the corporation. Given the deed to the property was in the name of the religious corporation and the corporation's by-laws and the Religious Corporation Laws unequivocally granted the trustees, as well as the archbishop specifically, the power to control and administer the property of the church corporation, the authority to demolish the church building was within their purview.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Religious Corporations and Associations -- Demolition of Church Building -- Authority of Former Parishioners to Challenge Demolition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 5 of the Religious Corporations Law did not grant plaintiffs, former parishioners of a Roman Catholic church incorporated as a religious corporation, the authority to challenge the decision to demolish the church, which was properly voted upon by the board of trustees and sanctioned by the archbishop. Section 5 vests the custody and control of a religious corporation's real property in the board of trustees and states that the trustees of an incorporated Roman Catholic church shall not transfer any property without the consent of the bishop or archbishop of the diocese. Section 5 is consistent with the church corporation bylaws and sections 91 and 92 of the Religious Corporations Law, which explain the governance of an incorporated Roman Catholic church and the division and disposition of parish property, in uniformly recognizing the authority of the board of trustees and the archbishop to control church property. Applying the neutral principles of law doctrine, no right or authority to veto the demolition decision was reserved for the benefit of the parishioners. Pursuant to the bylaws, parishioners were members of the ecclesiastical body--not members of a corporation, and such status did not confer upon them the rights and duties as members of the religious corporation. Given that the deed to the property at issue was in the name of the religious corporation, and the corporation's bylaws and the Religious Corporations Law unequivocally granted the trustees, as well as the archbishop specifically, the power to control and administer the property of the church corporation, the authority to demolish the church building was within their purview.  </SPAN></P>

Therefore, money passed to the public benefit corporations was not subject to the N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 8 (1) prohibition against gifting or loaning State money as such money was no longer in the control of the State.

Plaintiff taxpayers' challenge pursuant to article VII, &sect; 8 (1) of the New York State Constitution to appropriations in the New York State 2008-2009 budget to defendant public benefit corporation to fund payments to private entities for public development purposes was properly dismissed by Supreme Court. Article VII, &sect; 8 (1) of the State Constitution precludes the State from giving or loaning &quot;money&quot; to private recipients and it more broadly forbids the State from giving or lending its &quot;credit&quot; to private recipients or public corporations. Although the State may not lend its credit to a public corporation, such as defendant, nothing in article VII, &sect; 8 (1) prohibits the State from adopting appropriations directed to such public entities. Because public benefit corporations benefit from a status separate and apart from the State, money passed to public corporations consequently cannot be subject to the article VII, &sect; 8 (1) prohibition against gifting or loaning State money as such money is no longer in the control of the State.  </SPAN></P>

An appropriation that results in funds being given directly by the State to private recipients is valid where it has a predominant public purpose and any private benefit is merely incidental. Here, the very purpose of the Department of Agriculture and Markets is to obtain specialized marketing services to promote a major industry in New York--the agriculture industry--for the overall benefit of the public and the State's competitiveness to foster growth in this important sector of the State's economy. Moreover, the Department is authorized to assist in the promotion and marketing of New York's wine and fruit products. The appropriations at issue here, which provided funding for contracts between the Department and the New York State Apple Growers Association, New York Wine and Grape Foundation and Long Island Wine Council, all fulfilled a predominantly public purpose and were not prohibited under article VII, &sect; 8 (1).  </SPAN></P>

Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 15(3)(w), providing for capped permanent partial disability awards, clearly applied to accidents and dates of disablement which occurred on or after the enactment date of the bill, March 13, 2007.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a workers' compensation proceeding that resulted in an uncapped non-schedule permanent partial disability award for claimant, the insurance carrier for claimant's employer was required under Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 27 (2) to deposit a lump-sum amount into the Aggregate Trust Fund (ATF) representing the present value of the award. Section 27 (2), as amended in 2007, mandates that private insurance carriers make a deposit into the ATF of the present value of awards made pursuant to Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 15 (3) (w), and was applicable to claimant's 2008 award. Although section 15 (3) (w) was also amended in 2007 so as to cap the number of weeks that a person is eligible to receive benefits for a non-schedule permanent partial disability, that amendment did not apply to claimant, who was injured in 2004, and his award was not capped. The Legislature specifically chose the date of the accident as the demarcation point between those claimants who qualify for the uncapped award pursuant to the pre-amended Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 15 (3) (w) and the capped award pursuant to the amended statute, and further specifically chose the date of the award, without regard to the date of the injury, as the point where the deposit of a lump-sum payment into the ATF representing the present value of the benefits is required pursuant to Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 27 (2). Accordingly, a private insurance carrier is required to deposit into the ATF the present value of awards that are subject to both the pre- and post-amended section 15 (3) (w).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 27 (2), which, as amended in 2007, mandates that private insurance carriers make a deposit into the Aggregate Trust Fund (ATF) of the present value of non-schedule permanent partial disability awards made after the effective date of the statute's amendment, is not retroactive. The fact that an award required to be deposited into the ATF under section 27 (2) may relate to an injury that occurred prior to the statute's amendment does not render the statute retroactive. A statute is not retroactive when made to apply to future transactions merely because such transactions relate to and are founded upon antecedent events. Here, the insurance carrier for claimant's employer was required under the amended statute to deposit with the ATF the present value of claimant's 2008 uncapped non-schedule permanent partial disability award arising from a 2004 injury. The amendment neither altered the carrier's preexisting liability nor imposed a wholly unexpected new procedure. It merely changed the time and manner of payments of non-schedule permanent partial disability awards.</SPAN></P>

The deposit of the present value of the future benefit was legislatively mandated by Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 27 (2) and the procedure for the calculation of such an award was governed by Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 27 (5) using specific actuarial tables. Thus, using the actuarial tables, as required by the statute, to calculate the present value of the award was not impermissibly speculative and the Board, in following the Legislature's clear direction, did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in mandating the deposit.</SPAN></P>

Prior to the amendment of the Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 27 (2) the Board could, at its discretion, require a carrier to deposit the present value of the award into the ATF.

Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 27 (2), which, as amended in 2007, mandated that the private insurance carrier for claimant's employer deposit a lump-sum amount into the Aggregate Trust Fund (ATF) representing the present value of claimant's 2008 uncapped non-schedule permanent partial disability award arising from a 2004 injury, did not violate the carrier's equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Although private insurers are treated differently from the State Insurance Fund and self-insurers, there is a rational basis for differential treatment of separate classes of insurers. The basis for requiring a private insurer to deposit the present value of a future award into the ATF is to protect claimants from carrier insolvency. The same goal is achieved by the State Insurance Fund because of its status as a state agency, and self-insurers have a separate regulatory framework to safeguard against insolvency (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;12 NYCRR 315.2-315.4).</SPAN></P>

To establish a claim for violation of substantive due process, a party must establish a cognizable vested property interest and that the governmental action was wholly without legal justification. The statute did not deprive the carrier of property, because it did not increase the amount the carrier owed. Moreover, the carrier failed to make any showing that the statute was without legal justification and not supported by a rational legislative purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bombing at the World Trade Center (WTC), 648 plaintiffs commenced 174 actions against defendant Port Authority for injuries sustained in the bombing. The actions were litigated jointly and, following numerous determinations and appellate decisions, the parties returned to the Supreme Court (New York) for separate damages hearings. Upon a jury's verdict, the Supreme Court awarded damages to an individual. The Port Authority appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Terrorists drove a rented van containing a fertilizer bomb into the WTC parking garage. They parked the van on the side of one of the garage access ramps and lit the fuse on the bomb for a timed detonation to occur approximately 10 minutes later. The terrorists were able to enter and exit the parking garage area undetected. The resulting explosion, created a blast crater six stories deep and killed six people, including four Port Authority employees. The gravamen of the claims was a negligent failure by the Port Authority to provide adequate security. In the instant appeal, the Port Authority alleged that it was entitled to the protection of governmental immunity and that the terrorist attack was not foreseeable as a matter of law. CLS Uncons Laws of NY ch. 179, &sect;&sect; 1, 6 did not waive the Port Authority's right to assert a governmental immunity defense. The Port Authority was entitled to the protection of governmental immunity because its provision of security at the WTC constituted the performance of a governmental function. Any failure to secure the parking garage against terrorist attack predominantly derived from a failed allocation of police resources.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The waiver language in McKinney's Unconsolidated Laws of NY &sect;&sect; 7101 and 7106 (L 1950, ch 301, &sect;&sect; 1, 6) does not preclude the defendant Port Authority of New York and New Jersey from asserting the common-law defense of governmental immunity. There is a distinction between sovereign immunity and immunity-based defenses available to governmental agencies, and the mere waiver of sovereign immunity does not preclude a governmental agency from asserting an immunity-based defense where appropriate. A plain reading of section 7106 evinces a waiver of sovereign immunity, but there is no indication that the statute was meant to effectuate a concomitant, wholesale waiver of governmental immunity. The statute merely indicates that the waiver will have the intended effect of subjecting the Port Authority to lawsuit for claims sounding in tort. That the waiver treats the Port Authority like a private corporation does not have any unique significance beyond the waiver of sovereign immunity. Moreover, the singular waiver of the Port Authority's sovereign immunity and its exposure to distinct lawsuits is evidenced by the statutory scheme of sections 7101 through 7106 of the Unconsolidated Laws, which specify the impact of such waiver with respect to various causes of action.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Authorities -- Claims against Public Authorities -- Terrorist Bombing of World Trade Center -- Governmental Immunity of Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action to recover for injuries sustained as a result of a terrorist bombing at the World Trade Center (WTC), defendant Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversaw and operated the WTC, acted within its governmental capacity in its provision of security at the WTC because its security operations constituted police protection. Although the Port Authority performed dual proprietary and governmental functions, the determination of the primary capacity under which a governmental agency was acting turns solely on the acts or omissions claimed to have caused injury, that is, whether the precise failures for which the Port Authority was found liable were governmental or proprietary in nature. Here the gravamen of the complaint alleged a failure to provide adequate security. The Port Authority's purported lapses in adequately examining the risk and nature of terrorist attack and adopting specifically recommended security protocols to deter terrorist intrusion were not separable from the Port Authority's provision of security; rather, they were a consequence of the Authority's mobilization of police resources for its exhaustive study of the risk of terrorist attack, the policy-based planning of counter-terrorist strategy, and the consequent allocation of resources. The Authority's failure to allocate police resources lay not within the safety measures that a reasonable landowner would implement, but within security operations with respect to the strategic allocation of police resources. Police protection is a quintessential example of a governmental function. While the terrorist bombing within the parking garage of a commercial building complex may have implicated some proprietary responsibility, it could not overcome the governmental tenor of the security strategy established by the Port Authority to counteract terrorist intrusion.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Authorities -- Claims against Public Authorities -- Terrorist Bombing of World Trade Center -- Governmental Immunity of Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The complaint in an action to recover for injuries sustained as a result of a terrorist bombing at the World Trade Center (WTC) was dismissed where plaintiff alleged that defendant Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversaw and operated the WTC, failed to provide adequate security, since the Port Authority exercised discretion in its security decision-making entitling it to the common-law defense of governmental immunity. The Port Authority's administration of security at the WTC involved discretionary decision-making, and the governmental immunity doctrine recognizes that police protection is best left within the discretion of the governmental entity because police resources are limited. Given the finite nature of police resources, the mechanisms by which security and police protection is afforded cannot be dictated by the edict of a court or the retrospective conclusions of a jury. The record evinced that the Authority made the type of informed, policy-based decision-making that entitled a governmental agency to immunity. Moreover, governmental entities cannot be expected to be absolute, infallible guarantors of public safety, but in order to encourage them to engage in the affirmative conduct of diligently investigating security vulnerabilities and implementing appropriate safeguards, they must be provided with the latitude to render those critical decisions without threat of legal repercussion. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff policyholders sued defendant insurer, and others, arguing that a restructuring of the insurer constituted a fraudulent conveyance, breach of contract, abuse of the corporate form, and unjust enrichment. The trial court denied the insurer's motion seeking dismissal of the complaint. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, First Department, reversed and granted the insurer's motion to dismiss. The policyholders appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The policyholders claimed that the restructuring left the insurer undercapitalized and unable to meet its obligations under their policies. The principal issue was whether the restructuring, which was authorized by the Superintendent of the New York State Insurance Department (Superintendent) precluded the claims. The appellate court held that the Superintendent's approval did not bar the claims. Insurance Law &sect; 326(a) did not vest the Superintendent with the power to consider Debtor and Creditor Law and common law causes of action. Further, collateral estoppel was not triggered because the policyholders had no opportunity to contest the Superintendent's determination or, more importantly, challenge the validity of the financial information provided to him which formed the basis of the Superintendent's approval. The policyholders adequately pled causes of actions under Debtor and Creditor Law &sect;&sect; 273, 274, 276. The policyholders described a series of allegedly fraudulent transactions made in bad faith after the Superintendent's approval of the restructuring, which they ultimately asserted stripped about $ 5 billion in cash and securities out of the insurer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- Regulation of Insurers -- Restructuring of Insurance Company -- Approval of Restructuring by Superintendent of Insurance Does Not Bar Private Claims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The restructuring of defendant insurance company and its related subsidiaries and affiliates authorized by the Superintendent of the New York State Insurance Department did not bar plaintiff policyholders from asserting claims against defendant insurance company under the Debtor and Creditor Law and the common law. Plaintiffs alleged that the restructuring constituted a fraudulent conveyance and left defendant undercapitalized and unable to meet its obligations under the terms of their policies. The Superintendent's exclusive original jurisdiction to approve the restructuring of defendants under the relevant provisions of the Insurance Law did not make the Superintendent the exclusive arbiter of all private claims that might arise in connection with the restructuring. There was no indication from the statutory language and structure of the Insurance Law or its legislative history that the Legislature intended to give the Superintendent such broad preemptive power. Had the Legislature intended the Superintendent to extinguish the historic rights of policyholders to attack fraudulent transactions under the Debtor and Creditor Law or the common law, there would have been evidence of such intent in the statute, and affected policyholders, such as plaintiffs, would have notice and an opportunity to be heard before the Superintendent made his or her determinations. Moreover, Insurance Law &sect; 326 (a), which provides that the Superintendent's decisions are subject to review in a CPLR article 78 proceeding, did not confer exclusive authority on the Superintendent to adjudicate plaintiffs' private claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- Regulation of Insurers -- Restructuring of Insurance Company -- Collateral Attack on Approval of Restructuring by Superintendent of Insurance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The approval by the Superintendent of the New York State Insurance Department of the restructuring of defendant insurance company and its related subsidiaries and affiliates did not preclude plaintiff policyholders from asserting claims against defendant insurance company under the Debtor and Creditor Law and the common law. Collateral estoppel applies to an administrative proceeding provided that the administrative decision is quasi-judicial in character, meaning that it is rendered pursuant to the adjudicatory authority of an agency to decide cases brought before its tribunals employing procedures substantially similar to those used in a court of law. Even assuming the issues considered by the Superintendent in approving the restructuring were identical to the issues raised by plaintiffs in their plenary action, plaintiffs had no opportunity to contest the Superintendent's determination or, more importantly, challenge the validity of the financial information provided to him by defendants which formed the basis of the Superintendent's approval. The Superintendent did not conduct public hearings or provide public notice and he accepted the truth of defendant's submissions. There was nothing quasi-judicial about the Superintendent's approval process that ought to have been binding on plaintiffs. Moreover, plaintiffs were not in privity with the Superintendent, and due process would not permit a litigant to be bound by an adverse determination made in a prior proceeding to which the litigant was not a party or in privity with a party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Fraudulent Conveyances -- Transfer in Fraud of Creditors -- Restructuring of Insurance Company</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an action arising out of the restructuring of defendant insurance company and its related subsidiaries and affiliates in which plaintiff policyholders alleged that the restructuring constituted a fraudulent conveyance and left defendant undercapitalized and unable to meet its obligations under the terms of their policies, plaintiffs adequately pleaded causes of action for fraudulent conveyances under Debtor and Creditor Law &sect;&sect; 273, 274 and 276. Plaintiffs, who were creditors of defendant insurance company, supported their claims by describing a series of allegedly fraudulent transactions made in bad faith by defendants after the Superintendent of Insurance's approval of the restructuring, in which defendants assertedly stripped approximately $5 billion in cash and securities out of defendant insurance company. Further, plaintiffs alleged that defendant insurance company received no consideration for the assets it transferred to defendant parent company and that, as a result, defendant insurance company was insolvent and unable to meet its obligations under the terms of their policies. Those allegations supported causes of action under Debtor and Creditor Law &sect;&sect; 273 and 274, and, taken together and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs, sufficiently alleged an intent on the part of defendants to defraud plaintiffs under Debtor and Creditor Law &sect; 276.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Contracts -- Implied Covenants -- Good Faith and Fair Dealing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In an action arising out of the restructuring of defendant insurance company and its related subsidiaries and affiliates in which plaintiff policyholders alleged that the restructuring constituted a fraudulent conveyance and left defendant undercapitalized and unable to meet its obligations under the terms of their policies, plaintiffs pleaded a viable cause of action for breach of contract based upon a breach of the implied covenant of good faith. The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing embraces a pledge that neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract. Here, plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that defendant insurance company, by fraudulently transferring billions of dollars of its assets to defendant parent company for no consideration, violated the covenant by substantially reducing the likelihood that it would be able to meet its obligations under the terms of the insurance policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Corporations -- Disregarding Corporate Entity -- Restructuring of Insurance Company</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In an action arising out of the restructuring of defendant insurance company and its related subsidiaries and affiliates in which plaintiff policyholders alleged that the restructuring constituted a fraudulent conveyance and left defendant undercapitalized and unable to meet its obligations under the terms of their policies, the complaint adequately stated a claim for abuse of the corporate form that could support a declaration piercing the corporate veil of defendant. The party seeking to pierce the corporate veil must establish that the owners, through their domination, abused the privilege of doing business in the corporate form to perpetrate a wrong or injustice against that party such that a court in equity will intervene. Here, plaintiffs' allegations that defendant parent company abused its control of defendant insurance company, its wholly-owned subsidiary, by causing it to engage in harmful transactions that shielded billions of dollars in assets from plaintiffs and exposed them to significant liability met that test. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate filed a petition to run for the town's justice/board member seat. The residents objected to the petition, alleging that it was valid because the candidate did not meet the residency requirement. The court of appeals held that the residency requirement did not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The requirement was subject to a rational basis test, and a rational basis existed to justify the requirement. The direct impact of the residency requirement was not on one's right to vote, but on an individual's right to be a candidate for public office. The requirement imposed only reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions upon the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the voters of the town. It did not require a candidate to be a resident of the town prior to commencement of his/her term of office. Since the town seat was subject to a town-wide vote, the individual elected to fill the seat represented the entire town, not just the residents. The town residency requirement satisfied the rational basis test. The main purpose of the legislation was to ensure that the residents were not deprived of meaningful representation in town government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections -- Residence Requirement -- Equal Protection Challenge -- Rational Basis Standard </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In determining whether the residency requirement for the elected position of town justice/town board member, Fishers Island, Town of Southold, Suffolk County (L 1860, ch 113, &sect; 2, as amended by L 1898, ch 373, &sect; 1, as further amended by L 1977, ch 276, &sect; 1) violated the Equal Protection Clause (US Const, 14th Amend, &sect; 1; NY Const, art I, &sect; 11), application of a rational basis standard of review was appropriate. Election laws invariably impose some burden upon individual voters, and subjecting all voting regulations to strict scrutiny, and requiring that the regulations be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest, could interfere with the state's ability to ensure the fair and efficient operation of elections. A court's inquiry into the propriety of a state election law, therefore, depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation directly infringes upon First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Here, the direct impact of the residency requirement was not on one's right to vote, but on an individual's right to be a candidate for public office. The requirement imposed only reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions upon the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the voters of the Town of Southold. Since all Town Board members were elected in a town-wide election, the voters were not unduly restricted in their choice of candidates for Town Board positions. Moreover, any Southold resident who would otherwise be eligible to run for political office could run for the Fishers Island seat, as the residency requirement did not require a candidate to be a resident prior to commencement of his or her term.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections -- Residence Requirement -- Equal Protection Challenge </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The residency requirement for the elected position of town justice/town board member, Fishers Island, Town of Southold, Suffolk County (L 1860, ch 113, &sect; 2, as amended by L 1898, ch 373, &sect; 1, as further amended by L 1977, ch 276, &sect; 1) was supported by a rational basis and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause (US Const, 14th Amend, &sect; 1; NY Const, art I, &sect; 11). The residency requirement provides that the person holding the dual town justice/town board member position reside upon Fishers Island, which is situated in the Town of Southold, but has no direct ferry service to the mainland portion of the town. In light of the lack of direct transportation between Fishers Island and the mainland of the Town of Southold, the Fishers Island town justice, as a member of the Town Board, acted as the link between Town government and the people of Fishers Island. The legislative history of the residency requirement articulated several rational bases for the residency requirement and retaining the dual town justice/town board member seat--e.g., the main purpose of the legislation was to ensure that the residents of Fishers Island were not deprived of meaningful representation in town government. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed orders from the Appellate Division (New York), which affirmed trial court rulings that, inter alia, denied their suppression motions with respect to gravity knives seized from their pants pockets. The rulings arose in criminal matters, finding both defendants guilty of possession of a gravity knife, in violation of Penal Law &sect; 265.01(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As defendant-A walked by a police officer, the officer observed a hinged top of a knife in defendant-A's pocket. Upon approaching, the officer saw the outline of a knife through the pocket material. Defendant-A admitted that he had a knife there, and the knife was recovered upon a frisk of defendant. Defendant-A was arrested for possession of a gravity knife. His suppression motion was denied, and defendant-A entered a guilty plea. Defendant-B was stopped by an officer, who observed the top of a knife protruding in plain view from defendant-B's pants pocket. The knife, as well as another, were seized, and defendant-B was arrested. His suppression motion was denied. Both suppression rulings were affirmed on appeal. On further review, the court found that the officer in defendant-A's matter  was unable to testify that he suspected or believed the knife to be a gravity knife. Accordingly, he lacked reasonable suspicion to support the seizure of the knife. However, the officer dealing with defendant-B established reasonable suspicion that the knife was unlawful. Accordingly, suppression should have been granted with respect to the knife taken from defendant-A.</SPAN></P>

In a prosecution arising from defendant's possession of a gravity knife (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 265.01 [1]), the arresting officer's observations of the hinged top of a closed knife and outline of a knife in defendant's pocket did not, as a matter of law, provide reasonable suspicion of criminal activity justifying a stop and frisk where the arresting officer was unable to testify that he suspected or believed the observed object to be a gravity knife. Reasonable suspicion does not require absolute certainty that the knife carried is a gravity knife, as opposed to a similar, but legal object, such as a pocketknife. However, the detaining officer must have reason to believe, based on his or her experience and training and/or observable, identifiable characteristics, that the object observed is a gravity knife. The detaining officer must possess specific and articulable facts from which he or she inferred that the defendant was carrying a gravity knife. Here, the arresting officer testified that the knife in defendant's pocket looked like a pocketknife. Consequently the defendant's motion to suppress was granted.</SPAN></P>

Reasonable suspicion does not require absolute certainty that the knife carried is a gravity knife, as opposed to a similar, but legal object, such as a pocketknife. However, the detaining officer must have reason to believe, based on his or her experience and training and/or observable, identifiable characteristics, that the object observed is a gravity knife. The detaining officer must possess specific and articulable facts from which he or she inferred that the defendant was carrying a gravity knife. Here, the officer had made approximately 300 arrests involving gravity knives and testified that gravity knives are often carried in such a way as to make them readily accessible. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In six consolidated appeals, defendants were resentenced to postrelease supervision (PRS) before completion of their originally-imposed sentences of imprisonment. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, First Department, and Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, Second Department, affirmed as to five defendants, and the Second Division reversed as to one defendant. Defendants and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial courts did not pronounce PRS, and thus committed a Sparber error, at the original sentencings, and defendants were later resentenced to PRS. Defendants argued that because they served &quot;significant&quot; or &quot;substantial&quot; portions of their originally-imposed sentences before resentencing, they acquired a legitimate expectation of finality, and, as a result, a greater sentence was barred. However, the appellate court found that defendants were presumed to have been aware that a determinate prison sentence without a PRS term was illegal and subject to correction, and thus could not have claimed a legitimate expectation that the originally-imposed, improper sentence was final for all purposes. Further, defendants did not establish that the government's conduct shocked the conscience and failed to make out a substantive due process violation. The resentencings merely imposed statutorily-required sentences. Because defendants were merely being required to serve a part of their sentences of which they were always cognizant, any prejudice resulting from resentencing was de minimis. Moreover, the government acted diligently to correct the Sparber errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders were affirmed in each case, except in the case where the resentencing was affirmed by the intermediate appellate court.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Resentence -- Postrelease Supervision -- Double Jeopardy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Federal Constitution did not bar the imposition of postrelease supervision (PRS) at the resentencing of defendants, who were resentenced, before completion of their originally-imposed sentences of imprisonment, so as to add the mandatory term of PRS that their respective sentencing judges had failed to pronounce when defendants were originally sentenced. An expectation of finality arises for purposes of double jeopardy when a defendant completes the lawful portion of an illegal sentence and exhausts any appeal taken. Here, five of the six defendants were still incarcerated when resentenced, and the sixth had been conditionally released from prison after serving six sevenths of his originally-imposed sentence; accordingly, none had yet completed their sentences. A rule that resentencing to PRS should be precluded when a &quot;significant&quot; or &quot;substantial&quot; portion of the originally-imposed sentence of imprisonment has been served would supply no meaningful standard by which to measure a reasonable expectation of finality. Moreover, defendants offered no principled basis to interpret the State Constitution's Double Jeopardy Clause more broadly than its federal counterpart.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Resentence -- Postrelease Supervision -- Due Process</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Substantive due process did not bar the imposition of postrelease supervision (PRS) at the resentencing of defendants, who were resentenced, before completion of their originally-imposed sentences of imprisonment, so as to add the mandatory term of PRS that their respective sentencing judges had failed to pronounce when defendants were originally sentenced. Substantive due process analysis requires a determination as to whether the right at issue is so deeply rooted in this Nation's history and traditions as to be considered fundamental, and, if so, whether the government's action is so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the conscience; negligence alone is insufficient to shock the conscience. Even assuming a defendant possesses a fundamental right not to have an illegal sentence revised upward to correct an error, defendants here could not establish that the government's conduct shocked the conscience. The resentencings merely imposed statutorily-required sentences and were aimed at an entire category of defendants whose sentences were improperly pronounced. Defendants also failed to meet the largely abandoned multi-factor test for determining when a defendant's expectation that his or her sentence will remain unchanged has &quot;crystallized&quot; such that resentencing would offend substantive due process. Here, among the multiple factors to be considered, defendants could not have developed a reasonable expectation in a prison sentence without PRS; any prejudice resulting from resentencing was de minimis; and the government acted diligently to correct the sentencing errors. Moreover, defendants suggested no reason to interpret substantive due process more broadly in these circumstances as a matter of state constitutional law.</SPAN></P>

A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Sparber</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> error amounts only to a procedural error, akin to a misstatement or clerical error, which the sentencing court can easily remedy. The sole remedy is to vacate the sentence and remit for a resentencing hearing so that the trial judge can make the required pronouncement that will include the relevant PRS term. Resentencing to set right the flawed imposition of PRS at the original sentencing is not a plenary proceeding.   </SPAN></P>

A defendant's right to appeal is limited to the correction of errors or the abuse of discretion at the resentencing proceeding. As a resentencing court is not authorized to lower the prison sentence at a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Sparber</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> resentencing, appellate courts are likewise unauthorized to do so--i.e., the resentencing court's failure to consider a lesser sentence was not an error or defect subject to reversal or modification. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two cases, defendants moved to suppress evidence, challenging the People's eavesdropping warrant application. After the trial court denied the motions to suppress, defendants pled guilty to, inter alia, enterprise corruption and second degree grand larceny. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, First Department, affirmed. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed that the application for an eavesdropping warrant for a cell phone did not meet the dictates of CPL 700.15(4). Defendants argued that the People improperly used eavesdropping as a first step in the investigation and failed to provide a particularized showing that normal investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The appellate court found that the People's application showed that Labor Racketeering Unit (LRU) did not resort to wiretapping as a routine, initial step in its investigation. There was evidence supporting the findings of the lower courts that the LRU showed that normal investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The LRU investigator explained that physical surveillance was of limited use because, although it might have shown subjects meeting, it would rarely allow the LRU to hear the conversations, and that any attempts by investigators to get closer to the subjects to hear the conversations would have rendered it more likely that the subjects would discover they were under investigation. It was of no moment that the People also used their experiences from a separate investigation to inform their allegations against defendants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution involving labor racketeering, there was record support for the findings of the courts below that the People's application for an eavesdropping warrant complied with CPL 700.15 (4) and 700.20 (2) (d), and that the investigators did not resort to wiretapping as a routine, initial step in their investigation of defendants' activities. The application revealed that an investigation of another organization led the investigators to defendants; that an analysis of cell phone records revealed numerous calls from defendants to construction companies with ties to organized crime; and that there had been collusive efforts between defendants and the organization that had originally been targeted. It was reasonable for the investigators to surmise that the originally targeted organization and defendants' organization, although rivals, joined forces when the opportunities presented themselves and that those organizations shared similar objectives. The investigators thereafter tried to identify one of the defendants by surveilling meetings that had been set up on intercepted calls but those efforts proved unsuccessful. Thus, there was plainly record support that the investigators did not resort to eavesdropping as a first step in its investigation of defendants, and the factual determinations by the lower courts were not further reviewable by the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Eavesdropping Warrants -- Showing of Necessity -- Futility of Normal Investigative Procedures </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution involving labor racketeering, there was record support for the findings of the courts below that the People's application for an eavesdropping warrant complied with CPL 700.15 (4) and 700.20 (2) (d), and that normal investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. An investigator explained that physical surveillance would rarely allow the investigators to hear the subjects' conversations without risk of discovery and the use of undercover officers would not have exposed the full scope of defendants' activities. The application explained the futility of conducting a grand jury investigation because many of the witnesses were participants in the criminal conduct who would be unlikely to testify out of fear of retaliation. Furthermore, the issuance of grand jury subpoenas would publicize the investigation, thereby foreclosing the use of other conventional investigatory techniques. In addition, the execution of search warrants would compromise the confidentiality of the investigation, increasing the likelihood that its targets would destroy inculpatory records. Having supported their application with reasons why normal investigative techniques would be ineffective, it was of no moment that the prosecution also utilized their experiences from another investigation to support their assertion that normal investigative techniques would be generally unproductive; it cannot be said the prosecution relied solely on past investigations. Defendants also were unable to demonstrate that, because normal investigatory measures had succeeded in another investigation, the warrant application here failed to establish that normal investigative measures were unlikely to succeed. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate cases, defendant one was convicted, after a jury trial, of second-degree burglary, and defendant two was convicted, on his guilty plea, of attempted robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The common issue in the appeals was whether defendants' motions to substitute appointed counsel were properly denied in light of the &quot;minimal inquiry&quot; standard of People v. Sides. The high court noted that an indigent defendant's right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 did not encompass the right to counsel of his own choosing. Defendant one's form motion for substitution of counsel made no specific factual allegations indicating  serious conflict with counsel, and a vague allegation of frustration with counsel was not sufficiently specific to require a minimal inquiry by the court, or the granting of his substitution motion. Defendant two did not indicate dissatisfaction with counsel until the trial court indicated at the sentencing hearing that it would enhance his sentence for his failure to comply with plea offer conditions; he then requested new counsel. The court engaged in sufficient minimal inquiry by directing questions to both defendant and his counsel and did not abuse its discretion in finding defendant's vague claims that he was coerced into pleading guilty unavailing.</SPAN></P>

Supreme Court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to substitute assigned counsel, made on the morning of jury selection, as defendant failed to proffer specific allegations in the form, pro se motion of a seemingly serious request that would have required the court to engage in a minimal inquiry. An indigent defendant's right to counsel does not encompass counsel of one's own choosing. Whether counsel is substituted is within the discretion and responsibility of the trial judge, and a court's duty to consider such a motion is invoked only where a defendant makes a seemingly serious request. If a defendant makes specific factual allegations of serious complaints about counsel, the court must make at least a minimal inquiry, and discern meritorious complaints from disingenuous applications by inquiring as to the nature of the disagreement or its potential for resolution. Here, defendant's form motion did not contain any specific factual allegations that would indicate a serious conflict with counsel, despite being provided the space to develop such a complaint. Moreover, Supreme Court did engage in a colloquy with defense counsel, who stated that he was not seeking to be replaced and further explained his belief that defendant's motion was based on &quot;frustration&quot; regarding how fingerprint evidence had been addressed, and properly exercised its discretion by considering the timing of the motion and expressing its confidence in the abilities of defense counsel.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Supreme Court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to substitute assigned counsel, made on the morning of his sentencing after he learned that the court would enhance his sentence for failure to comply with plea offer conditions, as the court engaged in sufficient minimal inquiry by directing questions to both defendant and defense counsel and found no further facts to support defendant's allegation that he was coerced into accepting the plea offer. An indigent defendant's right to counsel does not encompass counsel of one's own choosing. Whether counsel is substituted is within the discretion and responsibility of the trial judge, and a court's duty to consider such a motion is invoked only where a defendant makes a seemingly serious request. If a defendant makes specific factual allegations of serious complaints about counsel, the court must make at least a minimal inquiry and upon such review counsel may be substituted only where &quot;good cause&quot; is shown, considering the timing of the defendant's request, its effect on the progress of the case and whether present counsel will likely provide the defendant with meaningful assistance. Here, defendant never indicated any dissatisfaction with counsel until the morning of sentencing. Supreme Court engaged in sufficient minimal inquiry by directing questions to both defendant and defense counsel, but counsel consistently evaded expounding upon the motion. Supreme Court also properly considered the progress of the case, referring to prior assurances by defendant that he would plead guilty and comply with conditions of the plea offer. Moreover, it could be inferred from the record that the motion was a possible delay tactic. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and was sentenced, as a persistent violent felony offender, to concurrent terms of 16 years to life for three second degree burglary convictions, consecutive to concurrent terms of 2 to 4 years for two third degree grand larceny convictions, and consecutive to a term of 2 to 4 years on a bail jumping conviction. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, First Department, modified. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intermediate appellate court directed that the larceny sentences be served concurrently with the burglary sentences. The intermediate appellate court held that, inter alia, since larceny was the only crime that satisfied the intent element of burglary, the acts making up each crime were not separate and distinct. However, the appellate court found that the burglary was completed when defendant entered each complainant's apartment with the intent to commit a crime. The ensuing larceny was a separate crime, perpetrated through defendant's separate act of stealing property. The test for consecutive or concurrent sentences was not whether the criminal intent was one and the same and inspiring the whole transaction, but whether separate acts were committed with the requisite criminal intent. The crimes at issue were separate offenses that were committed through separate acts. Nor was one offense a material element of the other. Concurrent sentences, therefore, were not required under Penal Law &sect; 70.25(2). The record afforded no basis for finding defendant incompetent as a matter of law. The persistent violent felony offender sentencing scheme was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Concurrent and Consecutive Terms -- Sentences for Burglary and Grand Larceny</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a criminal prosecution wherein defendant was convicted of burglary in the second degree and grand larceny in the third degree based on evidence that he had broken into two separate apartments and stole several thousand dollars worth of personal property from each, the Appellate Division erred in concluding that, since larceny was the only crime that satisfied the intent element of burglary, the sentences for the burglary and grand larceny convictions must be concurrent. Concurrent sentences are required under the provisions of Penal Law &sect; 70.25 (2) when the actus reus, i.e., the wrongful deed that comprises the physical components of a crime, is a single inseparable act that violates more than one statute. A court must look to the statutory definitions of the crimes to determine whether the actus reus element is the same for both offenses or if the actus reus for one offense is a material element of the second offense. Consecutive sentences are authorized where there is some overlap in the elements of multiple offenses if it is established that the acts or omissions committed were separate and distinct. Here, the burglary and larceny offenses did not contain the same actus reus. Second-degree burglary is defined as knowingly entering or remaining unlawfully in a dwelling with the intent to commit a crime therein (Penal Law &sect; 140.25 [2]), which defendant completed when he entered each apartment with the intent to commit a crime. Defendant committed grand larceny in the third degree (Penal Law &sect; 155.35 [1]) through his separate act of stealing property valued at over $ 3,000.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fitness to Proceed to Trial</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a criminal prosecution, the record provided no basis for finding defendant incompetent to stand trial as a matter of law. At the competency hearing, four experts, including one doctor who had previously found defendant unfit, concluded that defendant was competent. Even the defense expert who found defendant unfit agreed that defendant understood the nature of the charges and the potential penalties. Though it appeared unusual that defendant, after initially being declared unfit to stand trial by two experts, was returned as competent after only two weeks of treatment at a secure psychiatric facility, that may have been the result of error in the initial determinations. Accordingly, there was no basis to disturb the affirmed findings that defendant's failure to communicate with his attorney was volitional and that his depression did not prevent him from participating in his defense (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 730.10 [1]).  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution for murder and assault arising out of an incident in which defendant doused his victims with gasoline and a fire broke out, killing one person and severely injuring three others, the imposition of consecutive sentences was permissible with respect to the victim who died and two of the severely injured victims because separate acts constituted the actus reus of each depraved indifference crime against those victims. Defendant's acts of soaking each victim with gasoline in a room where other people were present, and where one of them was smoking a lit cigarette, were so inherently dangerous to each victim that defendant was properly found guilty of depraved indifference murder and depraved indifference assault based on those acts alone, irrespective of whether the jury found that defendant was the one who ignited the fire. Because defendant engaged in conduct which created a grave risk of death or serious physical injury to each of those victims, by separate and distinct acts of dousing them with gasoline, consecutive sentences were authorized under Penal Law &sect; 70.25 (2). </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution arising out of an incident in which a fire broke out after defendant doused certain victims with gasoline, the sentence imposed for the depraved indifference assault of one surviving victim must run concurrent to the sentences for the depraved indifference murder and assault imposed with respect to the other victims, since that victim was never doused with gasoline, but rather, was sprayed as a result of the dousing of the others. The risk-creating conduct for his conviction was the same act as that of the other victims, and his sentence must run concurrently (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 70.25 [2]). </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four cases consolidated for appeal, juries convicted defendants of various offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue in all four cases involved Batson challenges to CPL 270.20 peremptory juror strikes. The appellate court found that, in the first case, the defense failed to establish a prima facie case. Defense counsel alleged that the People used their challenges to create an &quot;all white jury,&quot; but the defense made no record of the racial or gender composition of the remaining venire nor did they articulate other facts or circumstances that gave rise to an inference of discrimination. In this case and in the second case, the facts alleged by the defense to support a prima facie case of racial discrimination rested solely on numerical grounds. In the third case, the trial court improperly sustained the People's reverse Batson application. The trial court's finding that counsel's assessments of the juror were not conclusions which would flow from the answers given was overly constricted. The crux of counsel's race neutral explanation to strike the juror was that she knew little to nothing about her, and thus the strike was not rooted in &quot;racial animosity&quot; but rather was an accepted trial strategy. There was support for the acceptance of the race neutral reasons in the fourth case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. While </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson v Kentucky</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (476 US 79, 106 S Ct 1712, 90 L Ed 2d 69 [1986]) initially requires the moving party to establish a prima facie case that the nonmoving party has intentionally used its peremptory challenges to discriminate against a cognizable group during the jury selection process, once the nonmoving party has placed its race-neutral reasons on the record, the sufficiency of the prima facie showing becomes &quot;moot.&quot; To revisit the adequacy of the initial showing unnecessarily evades the ultimate question of discrimination. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant failed to meet his burden of establishing, during jury selection, a prima facie case of discrimination under step one of the three-step test formulated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson v Kentucky</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (476 US 79, 106 S Ct 1712, 90 L Ed 2d 69 [1986]) where, after alleging that the People impermissibly used their challenges to exclude four African-American females, the defense made no record of the racial or gender composition of the remaining venire nor articulated other facts or circumstances that, in its view, gave rise to an inference of discrimination. Inasmuch as the 12-person jury ultimately selected consisted of five females, one of whom was African-American, mere numerical assertions alone would not give rise to a mandatory inference of discrimination. To sustain a prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination absent a 100% exclusion rate of a cognizable group, the moving party must place other factors on the record to meet its step one burden. One relevant factor is whether defendant is a member of the same cognizable group that the People are allegedly aiming to exclude. Here, neither defendant nor any of his codefendants was a female African-American, and the defense did not argue that the People treated the four challenged females disparately vis-&aacute;-vis the unchallenged prospective jurors, or that the People excluded the cognizable group because they would, for some reason, be more favorably disposed to the defense. Because the numerical arguments alone advanced by defendant did not give rise to a prima facie case of impermissible discrimination, the trial court properly denied defendant's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> application. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant, an African-American male, failed to meet his step one burden of establishing a prima facie case of impermissible discrimination under the three-step test formulated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson v Kentucky</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (476 US 79, 106 S Ct 1712, 90 L Ed 2d 69 [1986]) where the defense argued that a prima facie case was simply &quot;a question of numbers&quot; and had been established because the People had eliminated the only two African-American panelists considered in a particular round of jury selection. Defense counsel did not make a record of the racial composition of the remaining venire nor did he argue that the People peremptorily struck African-American prospective jurors seated during a prior round of jury selection. Furthermore, counsel did not enumerate any other factors supporting an inference of discrimination. The trial court specifically advised defense counsel that he could renew his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> challenge at a later point if he saw fit; however, at the conclusion of the voir dire, defense counsel elected not to renew his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> challenge. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Once a prima facie case of impermissible discrimination in the use of peremptory jury challenges has been established pursuant to the three-step test formulated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson v Kentucky</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (476 US 79, 106 S Ct 1712, 90 L Ed 2d 69 [1986]), the burden shifts to the opposing party, in step two, to set forth a race-neutral reason for each of the stricken jurors. If the explanations proffered by the nonmoving party are race neutral, the burden then shifts back to the moving party, at step three, to persuade the court that the reasons were merely a pretext for intentional discrimination. A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inquiry vests the trial judge with broad discretion to determine the parties' credibility, and a trial court's determination whether a proffered race-neutral reason is pretextual is an issue of fact to be accorded deference on appeal. However, a trial court must establish a meaningful record for a reviewing court to uphold its ruling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Selection of Jury -- Finding of Pretext under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Batson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. There was no record support for the trial court's finding that the race-neutral reasons offered by the defense for using a peremptory challenge to exclude a prospective Asian-American juror were a pretext for intentional discrimination in violation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson v Kentucky</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (476 US 79, 106 S Ct 1712, 90 L Ed 2d 69 [1986]). The trial court's conclusions were an overly constricted view of the record warranting no deference on review. Defense counsel's choice not to ask the prospective Asian-American juror a single question during voir dire was not an indication of a specific racial bias given that the court severely curtailed the parties from questioning the panelists, precluding them from conducting a more meaningful voir dire by limiting each side to 10 minutes of questioning for the group of 18 panelists. Furthermore, there was no support in the record that counsel purposely avoided questioning panelists of Asian descent in order to justify peremptorily striking them later. The crux of counsel's race-neutral explanation to strike the prospective juror was that counsel knew little or nothing about the prospective juror. Counsel's decision to strike the prospective juror could not be construed to be rooted in racial animosity, but rather had a rationale with some basis in accepted trial strategy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Selection of Jury -- Finding of Pretext under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Batson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Defense counsel's initial &quot;reluctance&quot; to offer a race-neutral reason for using a peremptory challenge to exclude a prospective Asian-American juror did not support the trial court's later finding that counsel's reasons for striking the juror were a pretext for intentional discrimination in violation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson v Kentucky</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (476 US 79, 106 S Ct 1712, 90 L Ed 2d 69 [1986]). Rather, a review of the record indicated that counsel was of the genuine belief that she was under no requirement to provide a reason for that peremptory strike. In defending her exclusion of another prospective Asian-American juror, defense counsel went to great lengths to dispute that a pattern of discrimination against persons of Asian descent had been established. Consequently, counsel's decision not to explain her basis for challenging this juror did not demonstrate a racial bias, but rather an understanding of the right to lodge peremptory challenges without providing a reason. Notably, the record would have been more complete had the trial court not denied counsel's proposal to reopen voir dire following the court's finding of pretext. Counsel's willingness to have the juror returned for questioning was indicative of a genuine desire to learn more about her and a reflection that counsel's decision to strike her in the first instance was not on account of race. Nor can it be said that counsel's reflections about the juror's austere demeanor and temperament indicated impermissible racial stereotyping. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Selection of Jury -- Finding of Pretext under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Batson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. While the sufficiency of the prima facie showing of impermissible discrimination in the use of peremptory challenges under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson v Kentucky</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (476 US 79, 106 S Ct 1712, 90 L Ed 2d 69 [1986]) becomes moot once a party states its race-neutral reasons for lodging a peremptory strike, the strength or paucity of the prima facie showing is a factor that should be considered in determining whether the record as a whole supports a finding that the nonmovant's reasons for challenging the juror were pretextual. Here, where defense counsel utilized peremptory challenges to strike two prospective jurors of Asian descent and at least three other persons from the venire were likely of Asian descent, the People's prima facie case, which rested solely on the fact that defense counsel struck two jurors of Asian descent in one particular round of jury selection, was weak and was another factor undermining the trial court's finding of pretext. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Harmless and Prejudicial Error -- Mistaken </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Batson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Ruling </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. A trial court's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> error in precluding counsel from exercising a peremptory challenge to exclude a potential juror (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson v Kentucky</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 476 US 79, 106 S Ct 1712, 90 L Ed 2d 69 [1986]) mandates automatic reversal under New York law. Peremptory challenges are a mainstay in a litigant's strategic arsenal. The unjustified denial of a peremptory challenge violates CPL 270.25 (2) and requires reversal without regard to harmless error. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Selection of Jury -- Race-Neutral Reasons for Exercise of Peremptory Challenges</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The record supported the trial court's determination that the prosecutor's race-neutral justifications for using peremptory challenges against three prospective jurors were not pretextual in violation of step three of the test formulated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson v Kentucky </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">(476 US 79, 106 S Ct 1712, 90 L Ed 2d 69 [1986]). The People's articulated basis for striking one potential juror related to his overall courtroom demeanor, and the trial court's recognition of that prospective juror's &quot;body-language problem&quot; was entitled to the deference on review accorded demeanor and credibility determinations. The reasons for striking two other potential jurors--residence, employment status and educational backgrounds--had some basis in accepted trial strategy. Trial courts must evaluate whether proffered race-neutral reasons are pretextual based on the totality of all relevant facts and circumstances. Whether a proffered reason relates to the facts of a case or a prospective juror's qualifications is certainly a factor relevant to a court's determination of pretext, but is not automatically dispositive. So long as race or gender is not a factor in the decision-making process, the parties are free to exercise their allotted peremptory challenges as they deem appropriate. Here, where the record established that the People employed a general strategy to select primarily educated jurors with gainful employment or who have had at least a prior history of employment, there was no basis to conclude that the three stricken jurors were treated disparately in relation to the jurors selected by the parties or that race played any part in their being peremptorily challenged. </SPAN></P>

The high court held that when defense counsel disregarded a client's timely request to file a notice of appeal, the attorney acted in a professionally unreasonable manner, and the deficient performance amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Due Process Clause. In such circumstances, the one-year time limit imposed by &sect; 460.30 did not categorically bar an appellate court from considering the defendant's application to pursue an untimely appeal.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes - Appeal - Extension of Time for Taking Appeal - Exception to One-Year Time Limit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The one-year time limit contained in CPL 460.30 (1) for the filing of a motion for leave to file a late notice of appeal does not categorically bar an appellate court from considering an application to pursue an untimely appeal made by a defendant whose attorney failed to comply with the defendant's timely request for the filing of a notice of appeal and who alleges that the omission could not reasonably have been discovered within the one-year period. For purposes of invoking this exception to the general bar on seeking relief after the expiration of the statutory grace period, the common-law writ of error coram nobis is the appropriate avenue for relief. Since the adoption of the CPL, the writ continues to be available to alleviate a constitutional wrong when a defendant has no other procedural recourse. Here, each defendant, in seeking coram nobis relief, claimed that his right to appeal was lost because his attorney failed to comply with the timely request to file a notice of appeal. Those alleged constitutional errors did not appear on the trial record and defendants could not have brought those errors to the attention of the trial courts since the omissions did not occur until after the judgments of conviction. Furthermore, the coram nobis proceedings brought by defendants sought only the right to pursue an appeal--they were not a substitute for a new trial, appeal or other statutory remedy. The only statutory recourse for defendants, CPL 460.30, was unavailable because the one-year time limit had expired.  </SPAN></P>

At the Appellate Division, the People did not argue that a due diligence standard should be employed, did not oppose either defendant's application, and never suggested that the loss of appellate rights was attributable to anything other than deficient performance by trial counsel. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court of appeals was whether the ESDC's exercise of its power of eminent domain to acquire the property for the development of a new Columbia University campus was supported by a sufficient public use, benefit, or purpose. The court of appeals concluded it was, as the ESDC's findings of blight and determination that the condemnation qualified as a land use improvement project were rationally based. Two reports prepared by ESDC consultants arrived at the conclusion that the project site was blighted. The ESDC considered a wide range of factors, including the physical, economic, engineering, and environmental conditions of the site and thus, the finding of blight was not irrational or baseless. Contrary to the business owners' claim, the term &quot;substandard or insanitary area&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague on its face. In addition, the ESDC properly qualified the project as a &quot;civic project&quot; within the meaning of the New York State Urban Development Corporation Act. Despite the fact that the university is private, the purpose of the project was civic in that it was to promote education and academic research while providing public benefits to the community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Judicial Review -- Findings of Blight </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In proceedings to review a determination by respondent Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC) authorizing the acquistion of petitioners' property by eminent domain for the development of a new campus for a private university (the Project), ESDC's findings of blight and determination that the condemnation of petitioners' property qualified as a &quot;land use improvement project&quot; within the meaning of the New York State Urban Development Corporation Act (UDC Act) (McKinney's Uncons Laws of NY &sect; 6253 [6] [c]) were rationally based and entitled to deference. The removal of urban blight is a proper and constitutionally sanctioned predicate for the exercise of the power of eminent domain (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art XVIII, &sect;1). Two reports prepared by ESDC consultants concluded that the area of the Project site was blighted within the meaning of the UDC Act (Uncons Laws &sect; 6260 [c]; &sect; 6253 [12]). On the record upon which the ESDC determination was based, it could not be said that ESDC's finding of blight was irrational or baseless. ESDC considered a wide range of factors including the physical, economic, engineering and environmental conditions at the Project site, and its decision was based on the Project site conditions as a whole. Accordingly, since there was record support for ESDC's determination that the Project site was blighted, the Appellate Division plurality erred when it conducted a de novo review of the administrative records and concluded that the Project site was not blighted, thereby substituting its view for that of the legislatively designated agency.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Judicial Review -- Findings of Blight -- Objectivity of Consultant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In proceedings to review a determination by respondent Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC) authorizing the acquistion of petitioners' property by eminent domain for the development of a new campus for a private university (the Project), ESDC utilized objective data in determining that the Project site was blighted and did not act in bad faith or pretextually. The neighborhood conditions study conducted by the consultant hired by ESDC was not compromised simply because the consultant had separately prepared an environmental impact statement on behalf of the university. Moreover, ESDC--as a measure of caution and in response to criticism of its choice to retain the consultant--hired a second consulting firm to conduct review of the Project site and this company arrived at similar conclusions. The second consulting firm did not merely review and rubber stamp the first consultant's study, but conducted its own independent research and gathered separate data and photographs of the area before arriving at its own conclusions. Further, the second consulting firm had never previously been affiliated with or employed by the university.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Eminent Domain -- Substandard or Insanitary Area</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statutory term &quot;substandard or insanitary area&quot; as used in the New York State Urban Development Corporation Act (UDC Act) (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McKinney's Uncons Laws of NY &sect; 6253 [12]; &sect; 6260 [c] [1]) is not unconstitutionally vague on its face. The UDC Act defines the term &quot;substandard or insanitary area&quot; as &quot;a slum, blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating area, or an area which has a blighting influence on the surrounding area&quot; (Uncons Law &sect; 6253 [12]). In the context of eminent domain cases, to guard against discriminatory application of the law, it is not necessary that the degree of deterioration or precise percentage of obsolescence or mathematical measurement of other factors be arrived at with precision. Many factors and interrelationships may be significant for a blight finding. Blight is an elastic concept that does not call for an inflexible, one-size-fits-all definition. Rather, blight or &quot;substandard or insanitary areas&quot; must be viewed on a case-by-case basis.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Judicial Review -- Finding of Blight -- Deterioration in Area Prior to Acquisition of Property for Project </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In proceedings to review a determination by respondent Empire State Development Corporation authorizing the acquistion of petitioners' property by eminent domain for the development of a new campus for a private university (the Project), the finding of the Appellate Division plurality that there was no evidence that the Project site was blighted prior to the university's acquisition of property there was belied by objective data in the record to the contrary. The plurality of the Appellate Division disregarded the blight study that was made at the request of the New York City Economic Development Corporation and was based on a survey of the Project site and surrounding neighborhood at a time when the university was only beginning to purchase property in the area. The study unequivocally concluded that there was &quot;ample evidence of deterioration of the building stock in the study area&quot; and that &quot;[s]ubstandard and unsanitary conditions were detected in the study area.&quot; Moreover, another consultant found that the neighborhood had suffered from a long-standing lack of investment interest. Thus, since there was record support that the Project site was blighted before the university began to acquire property in the area, the issue was beyond further review by the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain - Public Use - Urban Development Corporation Act - Civic Project - What Constitutes </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In authorizing the acquistion of petitioners' property by eminent domain for the development of a new campus for a private university (the Project), respondent Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC) properly qualified the Project as a civic project within the meaning of the New York State Urban Development Corporation Act (UDC Act). The UDC Act defines a civic project as &quot;[a] project or that portion of a multi-purpose project designed and intended for the purpose of providing facilities for educational ... purposes&quot; (McKinney's Uncons Laws of NY &sect; 6253 [6] [d]; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uncons Laws &sect; 6260 [d]). There is nothing in the statutory language limiting a proposed educational project to public educational institutions. Because the UDC Act encourages participation in projects by private entities, there is no reason to depart from the plain meaning of the word &quot;education&quot; by limiting the terms to public institutions. Moreover, consonant with the policy articulated in the UDC Act, ESDC has a history of participation in civic projects involving private entities. The purpose of the Project is to promote education and academic research while providing public benefits to the local community. The Project approved by ESDC--which provides for the expansion of the university's educational facilities and countless public benefits to the surrounding neighborhood, including cultural, recreational and job development benefits--qualifies as a &quot;civic project&quot; under the UDC Act.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Records- - Freedom of Information Law -- Procedural Due Process -- Failure to Turn Over Documents during Related Administrative Process </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Petitioners, owners of property that respondent Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC) sought to acquire through eminent domain for the development of a new campus for a private university (the Project), were not denied procedural due process when ESDC failed to turn over certain documents during the administrative process pursuant to petitioners' Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request and closed the record prior to completion of related FOIL litigation. ESDC did not withhold any documents that formed part of the administrative record, and petitioners were not entitled to discovery under article 2 of the EDPL. Petitioners had an opportunity to comment on the proposed Project in a meaningful manner--both orally and through written submissions--and at a meaningful time--well before ESDC issued its findings and determination to acquire petitioners' property by eminent domain. Although ESDC was ordered to turn over five additional documents in the separate FOIL proceedings that were litigated during and after the administrative process, a FOIL violation does not establish a due process violation even if petitioners were legally entitled to the documents under FOIL at the time of the public hearing. The due process protections embodied in the EDPL do not even allow for discovery. To establish that a FOIL violation rose to the level of a due process violation, petitioners must show that the withholding of the documents caused them prejudice. Petitioners did not meet their burden, neither explaining how they were deprived of a meaningful opportunity to be heard during the administrative process nor demonstrating the materiality of the records sought through FOIL. Moreover, petitioners did not explain why they failed to bring a motion to vacate the automatic stay pursuant to CPLR 5519 (c) following the Appellate Division order in their favor that granted their FOIL requests. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Notwithstanding defendants' failure to timely object in either New York City Criminal Court or Supreme Court to the transfer of their criminal prosecutions from local criminal courts to Supreme Court for trial pursuant to rules promulgated by the Chief Judge and Chief Administrative Judge that created the Bronx Criminal Division (BCD) or Integrated Domestic Violence (IDV) Parts in Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals addressed defendants' arguments on appeal that Supreme Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over defendants' trials and that the rules violate the New York Constitution and the Criminal Procedure Law. If Supreme Court--acting through the IDV Part or the BCD--did not possess the authority to conduct these proceedings, this would be a fundamental, nonwaivable defect in the mode of proceedings that could be raised by defendants on their direct appeal despite their failure to comply with preservation requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Removal to Superior Court -- Transfer of Misdemeanor Prosecutions from Local Criminal Courts to Supreme Court for Trial -- Legislative and Constitutional Authority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Supreme Court's transfer powers under NY Constitution, article VI, &sect; 19 (a) and the broad administrative authority vested pursuant to NY Constitution, article VI, &sect; 28 and Judiciary Law &sect; 211 provided the Chief Judge and the Chief Administrative Judge with the authority to promulgate rules that created the Bronx Criminal Division (BCD) and Integrated Domestic Violence (IDV) Parts in Supreme Court, which resulted in the transfer of certain misdemeanor prosecutions from local criminal courts to Supreme Court for trial. The intent of the IDV directive was to allow matters involving a single family to be resolved in one court by the same jurist, thereby eliminating fragmented judicial adjudication and relieving the parties of the burden and costs of having multiple actions pending in different courts. The BCD was created in order to permit certain cases originating in the New York City Criminal Court, Bronx County to be reassigned to the BCD for trial in order to alleviate a trial backlog that had developed in the Criminal Court. Even if statutory authorization was required before Supreme Court may transfer to itself cases arising in other courts pursuant to article VI, &sect; 19 (a), Judiciary Law &sect; 211 (1) (a) permits the Chief Judge to transfer cases between courts to further the efficient administration of justice and contains no language preventing the transfer of misdemeanor cases to Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Removal to Superior Court -- Transfer of Misdemeanor Prosecutions from Local Criminal Courts to Supreme Court for Trial -- Legislative and Constitutional Authority</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The Chief Judge and the Chief Administrative Judge did not exceed their constitutional and statutory powers in adopting directives which created the Bronx Criminal Division (BCD) and Integrated Domestic Violence (IDV) Parts to permit certain cases to be transferred from local criminal courts to Supreme Court for trial. Notwithstanding that the Legislature exercises significant control over the regulation of practice and procedure in the courts under NY Constitution, article VI, &sect; 30, this provision does not address or purport to curtail the authority granted the Supreme Court in NY Constitution, article VI, &sect; 19 (a) to transfer cases to itself &quot;[a]s may be provided by law,&quot; or the administrative power vested in Unified Court System (UCS) administrators in NY Constitution, article VI, &sect; 28. In drafting Judiciary Law &sect; 211, pursuant to which UCS administrators are authorized to transfer cases between courts, the Legislature made clear that it does not view the transfer of cases to be strictly a matter of practice and procedure. The Legislature's decision to classify certain matters as administrative in the statutory delineation of the powers of UCS administrators is compelling evidence that it intended to recognize their authority over such matters. Although the creation of the BCD impacted the work of the New York City Criminal Court, Bronx County, in permitting cases commenced in the Criminal Court to be reassigned to the BCD for trial when at least one felony or misdemeanor offense was charged in order to alleviate a trial backlog that had developed in the Criminal Court, its role has not been restricted to the point that it has ceased to effectively fulfill the role assigned under the New York Constitution (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art VI, &sect; 15). Nor, in any event, did UCS administrators exceed their authority and impermissibly tread in the legislative domain when they issued the BCD or IDV directives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurisdiction of Offenses -- Transfer of Misdemeanor Prosecutions from Local Criminal Courts to Supreme Court for Trial</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Supreme Court had subject matter jurisdiction over so-called &quot;unindicted&quot; misdemeanors, initiated by the filing of an information, in cases that had been transferred from local criminal courts to Supreme Court for trial pursuant to rules promulgated by the Chief Judge and Chief Administrative Judge which created the Bronx Criminal Division and Integrated Domestic Violence Parts in Supreme Court. Subject to certain limitations, the New York Constitution vests Supreme Court with the power to hear any case that any other court in the Unified Court System (UCS) could hear (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art VI, &sect; 7 [a]). The Legislature has not adopted statutes that purport to oust Supreme Court of the jurisdiction to try unindicted misdemeanor cases. In its express language, the Criminal Procedure Law acknowledges that superior courts--such as Supreme Court--have subject matter jurisdiction to try misdemeanor cases (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 10.20, 10.30 [1] [b]). Nor do the divestiture statutes in the CPL (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 170.20, 170.25) undermine this conclusion. The divestiture statutes address the ability of the parties--the People or the defendant--to effectuate the removal of a case to a superior court such as Supreme Court. They do not address, much less revoke, the transfer powers granted to Supreme Court and UCS administrators in the Constitution and Judiciary Law &sect; 211. Moreover, CPL 210.05, which directs that &quot;[t]he only methods of prosecuting an offense in a superior court are by an indictment filed therewith by a grand jury or by a superior court information filed therewith by a district attorney,&quot; is not a divestiture statute that prevents Supreme Court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over any criminal case until there has been an indictment or defendant has agreed to waive indictment and be prosecuted by superior court information. By its terms, the statute imposes a nonjurisdictional limitation on prosecutorial power. CPL 210.05 does not preclude Supreme Court from exercising trial jurisdiction over misdemeanor cases concurrent with other UCS courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Transfer of Misdemeanor Prosecutions from Local Criminal Courts to Supreme Court for Trial </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The transfer of defendants' misdemeanor prosecutions from the New York City Criminal Court, Bronx County to Supreme Court for trial pursuant to rules promulgated by the Chief Judge and Chief Administrative Judge which created the Bronx Criminal Division did not violate defendants' rights to equal protection. Defendants failed to identify any respect in which they received less favorable treatment in Supreme Court than they would have received had their nonjury trials been conducted in the New York City Criminal Court. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were involved in a romantic relationship in New York from 1989 through 1995, and cohabited during much, if not all, of that period. After many failed attempts, the mother became pregnant by artificial insemination. The parties shared the expenses associated with the conception, birth, and care of the child. However, four months after the child was born, the former partner ended the relationship. The mother, a Canadian citizen, moved into her parents' residence in Montreal with the child. She then filed an application for a declaration of parentage and an order of child support. Pursuant to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, Family Ct Act art. 5-B, the mother's application was transferred to the family court. The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that, pursuant to Family Ct Act &sect;&sect; 413(1)(a), 580-303, and N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 13(b)(4), the family court indisputably had jurisdiction to determine whether an individual parent--regardless of gender--was responsible for the support of a child. Because the mother asserted that the former partner was the child's parent, and was chargeable with the child's support, the case was within the family court's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed, and the case was remitted to the Appellate Division for consideration of issues raised, but not determined, on the appeal to that court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family Court had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the support petition brought pursuant to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (Family Ct Act art 5-B) by petitioner, the child's biological mother, seeking child support from respondent, petitioner's former same-sex partner. Family Court has jurisdiction to determine whether an individual parent--regardless of gender--is responsible for the support of a child (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Family Ct Act &sect; 413 [1] [a]). Because Family Court has the subject matter jurisdiction to ascertain the support obligations of a female parent, it also has the inherent authority to ascertain in certain cases whether a female respondent is, in fact, a child's parent. As petitioner here asserted that respondent was the child's parent, and was therefore chargeable with the child's support, the case was within Family Court's article 4 jurisdiction.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2004, the engineer placed his seal on digitally altered photographs submitted to DOB in connection with a pavement plan for a building under construction.

The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that although the engineer's inability to file papers with DOB for a future period of time was predicated on prior false filings, it did not render the Commissioner's application of Administrative Code of the City of NY &sect; 26-124(c) retroactive.

Where the requirements for engaging in a specific professional activity are amended to govern future eligibility, a statute does not operate retroactively notwithstanding that its application may be triggered by an event which occurred prior to its effective date. Administrative Code &sect; 26-124 (c), enacted for the purpose of promoting public safety and preventing the waste of taxpayer money by eliminating the filing of false information with the DOB, authorizes the Commissioner to refuse to accept applications or documents from any person found to have knowingly or negligently submitted false materials.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent assignee of a credit card account sued appellant debtor, seeking to collect on the account. The trial court entered summary judgment for the assignee. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, Third Department affirmed. The debtor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agreement contained a standard choice of law clause stating that it would be governed by Delaware law. The debtor was a New York resident. The appellate held that the Delaware choice of law clause did not require the application of the Delaware three-year statute of limitations, Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8106, to bar the claims because choice of law provisions typically applied to only substantive issues. However, CPLR 202 applied. The contract causes of action accrued in Delaware, the place where the assignor sustained the economic injury. Therefore, the borrowing statute applied and the Delaware three-year statute of limitations governed. There was no indication that the debtor ever resided in Delaware, nor was there any indication that Delaware intended for its tolling provision, Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8117, to apply to a nonresident. Therefore, the three-year statute of limitations was not extended. It was of no moment that the assignee was unable to obtain personal jurisdiction over the debtor in Delaware. The case was time-barred.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Conflict of Laws --What Law Governs - Choice of Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Delaware choice of law clause in defendant's credit card agreement with plaintiff's assignor did not require the application of the Delaware statute of limitations to bar plaintiff's claims for breach of contract and account stated. Choice of law provisions typically apply to only substantive issues, and statutes of limitations are considered &quot;procedural&quot; because they are deemed as pertaining to the remedy rather than the right. There being no express intention in the agreement that Delaware's statute of limitations was to apply to the parties' dispute, the choice of law provision could not be read to encompass that limitations period.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Limitation of Actions - What </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Governs - &quot;Borrowing Statute&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action to recover the balance due on a credit card issued to defendant by plaintiff's assignor, a Delaware corporation, it was necessary to apply CPLR 202, New York's &quot;borrowing statute,&quot; to plaintiff's claims for breach of contract and account stated to determine whether they were timely brought. The contract causes of action accrued in Delaware, the place where plaintiff's assignor sustained the economic injury when defendant allegedly breached the contract. As plaintiff's assignor was a nonresident and the causes of action accrued outside of New York, CPLR 202 required the causes of action to be timely under the limitation periods of both New York and the jurisdiction where the cause of action accrued. Accordingly, Delaware's three-year statute of limitations for breach of a credit contract governed. In determining whether the action, commenced more than three years after the alleged breach, would be barred in Delaware, it was necessary to &quot;borrow&quot; Delaware's tolling statute to determine whether plaintiff would have had the benefit of additional time to bring the action. The tolling provision, however, was meant to apply only in a circumstance where the defendant had a prior connection to Delaware. As there was no indication here that defendant ever resided in Delaware, nor any indication from the case law that Delaware intended for its tolling provision to apply to a nonresident like defendant, Delaware's tolling provision did not extend the three-year statute of limitations and plaintiff's action was time-barred.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Appellate Division (New York) that affirmed his conviction for possession contraband; defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained by way of a visual body cavity search that was performed on him in violation of his rights under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After two controlled purchases of cocaine had been made by known and reliable informants at the target premises, an all-persons-present warrant was issued. During execution of the warrant, defendant was subjected to a strip search, during which he was required to lift  his scrotum and then to bend over to expose his anal cavity. Incriminating evidence was discovered in the course of the latter exercise. The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that the warrant at issue ventured no more than that some persons present at the subject residence might have had cocaine upon their persons. There were no specific facts to support a reasonable suspicion that a particular person had secreted contraband beneath his or her clothes or in a body cavity. Accordingly, the extraordinary intrusion in the search of defendant were not within any authority the warrant was capable of conferring. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained by a body cavity search performed in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV, N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, and CPL 690.15(2).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Search Warrant </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. There was an insufficient predicate for issuance of a search warrant authorizing the search of all persons present at the time of its execution where the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant application stated that two controlled purchases of cocaine had been made by known and reliable informants at an apartment in a two-story residential building. Accordingly, the contraband defendant was convicted of possessing, which was recovered from his person by means of a strip search conducted on the authority of the all-persons-present warrant, should have been suppressed. Notwithstanding that warrants are constitutionally required to &quot;particularly describ[e] . . . the persons . . . to be seized&quot; (US Const 4th, 14th Amends; NY Const, art I, &sect; 12), CPL 690.15 (2) states that &quot;[a] search warrant which directs a search of a designated or described place, premises or vehicle, may also direct a search of any person present thereat or therein.&quot; In order to apply the statute without constitutional offense, the facts known and the reasonable inferences to which they give rise must create a substantial probability that the authorized invasions of privacy will be justified by discovery of the items sought from all persons present when the warrant is executed. Here, two isolated purchases of what must be supposed to have been small quantities of narcotics did not suffice to show that a residential location had been given over entirely to the drug trade, much less that every person at the location was probably a participant in drug trafficking. The warrant application did not state, as required, whether any innocent use of the premises had been observed. Nor was there information in the application respecting the number or behavior of the persons ordinarily present at the apartment at the time of the sought warrant's contemplated execution. The governing standard was not met by language in the warrant application to the effect that some persons present at the subject residence might have cocaine upon their persons.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Strip Search </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The contraband defendant was convicted of possessing, which was recovered from his person by means of a strip search conducted on the authority of a warrant authorizing the search of all persons present at the time of its execution, should have been suppressed in the absence of the existence of specific facts to support a reasonable suspicion that defendant had secreted contraband beneath his clothes or in a body cavity. Since such a predicate did not exist at the time that the warrant was sought, these extraordinary intrusions could not have been within any authority the warrant was capable of conferring. A post-arrest strip search must be based upon reasonable suspicion that an arrestee is hiding contraband beneath his or her clothing, and a search involving visual examination of an arrestee's anal and genital cavities--a distinctly elevated level of intrusion, which must be separately justified--may not be performed except upon a specific, articulable factual basis supporting a reasonable suspicion to believe the arrestee secreted evidence inside a body cavity. Thus, even where there is probable cause for an arrest, and a suspect has been arrested--something that had not yet occurred at the time of the search of defendant herein--there must, in addition to the predicate for the arrest, be grounds to justify the very significant intrusion of a strip or visual body cavity search. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In five separate cases, each defendant received determinate sentences that did not include a term of postrelease supervision (PRS). In criminal proceedings and one CPLR art. 78 proceeding, defendants appealed decisions of the Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, First Department and the Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, First Department which had upheld the imposition of PRS in a resentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was no dispute that defendants' original sentences that omitted the imposition of PRS were illegal. The appellate court held that, contrary to defendants' assertions, CPL 440.40 did not impose a one-year limitation on a court's authority to rectify the illegal sentences by imposing PRS pursuant to Correction Law &sect; 601-d and Penal Law &sect; 70.85. However, defendants had been released from their prison terms. The Double Jeopardy protection against multiple punishments prevented a sentence from being increased once the accused has a legitimate expectation in the finality of the sentence. Once an accused was released from custody and returned to the community after serving the period of incarceration ordered by the sentencing court, and the time to appeal the sentence had expired or the appeal had been finally determined, there was a legitimate expectation that the sentence, although illegal under the Penal Law, was final and the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented a court from modifying the sentence to include a period of postrelease supervision. Defendants' release erected a Double Jeopardy Clause barrier to any subsequent upward modifications of their original sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment dismissing one defendant's CPLR art. 78 petition was affirmed. The remaining resentences were vacated and the original sentences reinstated.</SPAN></P>

The resentencing proceedings of defendants, who had completed serving their sentences of imprisonment and had been released from prison but whose original sentences failed to include a mandatory term of postrelease supervision, were not barred by CPL 440.40 even though resentencing occurred more than one year after defendants were initially sentenced. CPL 440.40, which allows the People to move to set aside an invalid sentence within one year of its imposition, does not impose a one-year limitation on a court's authority to rectify an illegal sentence. The statute was designed to restrict the People's ability to move to set aside an illegal sentence and did not place a similar restriction on the court's inherent ability to correct its own errors.  </SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 70.85 specifies that in cases where PRS was required but not explicitly pronounced at sentencing, the matter may be returned for resentencing pursuant to Correction Law &sect; 601-d, and the court may decide to reimpose the original determinate sentence without PRS &quot;only on consent of the district attorney.&quot; Hence, a court may decline to impose PRS during resentencing only when the People issue the statutorily required consent under Penal Law &sect; 70.85.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Resentence -- Timeliness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. CPL 380.30, which requires that sentences must be imposed &quot;without unreasonable delay,&quot; did not cause sentencing courts seeking to correct illegal sentences that had failed to include a mandatory period of postrelease supervision to lose their jurisdiction over defendants who had completed their terms of imprisonment and were released from prison. Even assuming the statute applied, it was not violated because defendants were resentenced within a reasonable time after the Department of Correctional Services notified the courts that defendants were &quot;designated persons&quot; who qualified for resentencing under Correction Law &sect; 601-d.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Resentence -- Postrelease Supervision -- Double Jeopardy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment barred the imposition of postrelease supervision at the resentencing of defendants, who had completed serving their sentences of imprisonment and had been released from prison but whose original sentences failed to include a mandatory term of postrelease supervision. After defendants were released from prison, a legitimate expectation in the finality of a sentence arose and the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented reformation to attach a postrelease supervision component to the original completed sentence. So long as an illegal sentence is subject to correction, a defendant cannot claim a legitimate expectation that the originally imposed improper sentence is final for all purposes. However, there must be a temporal limitation on a court's ability to resentence a defendant. Accordingly, once a defendant was released from custody and returned to the community after serving the period of incarceration that was ordered by the sentencing court, and the time to appeal the sentence had expired or the appeal had been finally determined, there was a legitimate expectation that the sentence, although illegal under the Penal Law, was final and the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented a court from modifying the sentence to include a period of postrelease supervision. This expectation was not altered by the fact that some defendants were released from prison after serving less than the entire term of their determinate sentences or that some defendants signed documents pertaining to postrelease supervision before their release.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Review -- Resentencing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. The resentencing of defendant, who had completed serving his sentence of imprisonment and had been released from prison but whose original sentences failed to include a mandatory term of postrelease supervision (PRS), was reviewable despite his failure to raise any objections to the inclusion of a PRS term at the resentencing. Since the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment protected defendant from being resentenced to a more severe punishment after serving his sentence of imprisonment and being released into the community, the resentencing court did not retain jurisdiction to modify the original judgment that was entered. Because defendant's double jeopardy claim implicated a fundamental mode of proceedings, it was reviewable absent preservation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- Prohibition -- When Remedy Available--Resentencing of Criminal Defendant </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. A CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking to prohibit the resentencing of defendant in order to correct an illegal sentence by adding a period of postrelease supervision (PRS) was dismissed since the record did not indicate that the resentencing judge had considered whether it was appropriate to impose a term of PRS. The court's order scheduled the matter &quot;for consideration of whether the inmate should be re-sentenced, and that the Clerk arrange for counsel for both parties to appear&quot; on a specific date. Accordingly, there was no need to seek prohibition relief before the court determined the lawfulness of the sentence that was imposed or whether it would accept the served sentence without a term of PRS. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner judges and defendants, governor and legislators (the State defendants) appealed three orders by the Appellate Division (New York) that affirmed the trial courts' grant of summary judgment in favor of the judges on their separation of powers claim and dismissal of the causes of action attacking the constitutionality of Judiciary Law &sect;&sect; 221 through 221-i.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Beginning in 2006, the judiciary and the state senate unsuccessfully sought salary adjustments for the state's judges. Although the parties were in accord regarding the need to adjust judicial compensation, the Legislature and the Executive failed to come to an agreement on legislation effecting a judicial pay increase. The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that because of the constitutional requirement in N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 25(a) that judicial compensation be &quot;established by law,&quot; mandamus did not lie. The judges' equal protection cause of action was also properly dismissed. The Legislature's failure to address the effects of inflation did not equate to a per se violation of the Compensation Clause, &sect; 25(a). However, the State defendants' failure to consider judicial compensation on the merits violated the Separation of Powers Doctrine in N.Y. Const. arts. III, IV, VI. Judicial compensation, when addressed by the Legislature in present and future budget deliberations, could not depend on unrelated policy initiatives or legislative compensation adjustments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The Court of Appeals was required, pursuant to the Rule of Necessity, to hear and dispose of the constitutional issues raised in a hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding/declaratory judgment action and two related declaratory judgment actions challenging the failure to adjust judicial compensation since 1998. Although members of the Court of Appeals are paid via the salary schedule delineated in Judiciary Law &sect; 221 and therefore will be affected by the outcome of the appeals, no other judicial body with jurisdiction exists to hear the constitutional issues raised therein.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding/declaratory judgment action challenging the failure to adjust judicial compensation since 1998, mandamus did not lie to compel respondent State Comptroller to disburse all retroactive sums and pay the budgeted raises allocated in the 2006-2007 state budget for judicial salary reform. Chapter 51 of the Laws of 2006, addressing &quot;JUDICIAL COMPENSATION REFORM,&quot; contained a $ 69.5 million budget item to adjust judicial compensation &quot;pursuant to a chapter of the laws of 2006.&quot; No subsequent chapter law, however, was enacted either amending the Judiciary Law salary schedules or directing the disbursement of the funds. Because judicial compensation was constitutionally required to be &quot;established by law&quot; (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25 [a]) and no subsequent chapter law was ever enacted, mandamus did not lie.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries - Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation -- Equal Protection </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding/declaratory judgment action challenging the failure to adjust judicial compensation since 1998, Supreme Court properly dismissed petitioners' cause of action alleging that the Judiciary constituted a &quot;suspect class&quot; that had been denied equal protection under the law because judicial pay raises have been historically contingent on or &quot;tied to&quot; salary increases for legislators.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation -- Compensation Clause -- Failure to Address Effects of Inflation Not Per Se Violation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding/declaratory judgment action and related declaratory judgment action challenging the failure to adjust judicial compensation since 1998, the failure to address the effects of inflation did not equate to a per se violation of the Compensation Clause (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25 [a]). Although the Compensation Clause plainly prohibits the diminution of judicial compensation by legislative act during a judge's term of office, there was no evidence in the history of the Clause's enactment or subsequent amendments that supported a broad interpretation embracing indirect diminishment by neglect, and therefore no evidence that the &quot;no diminishment&quot; rule was intended to affirmatively require that judicial salaries be adjusted to keep pace with the cost of living. The diminution in value of judicial compensation by inflation was a concern when the clause was enacted and amended, but the drafters decided that the best way to combat the effects of inflation was to count on the Legislature to assure the fair and appropriate compensation of the Judiciary.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation -- Compensation Clause -- No Discrimination against Judiciary in Violation of Compensation Clause </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In a declaratory judgment action challenging the failure to adjust judicial compensation since 1998, Supreme Court properly dismissed plaintiffs' cause of action alleging that defendants discriminated against the Judiciary in violation of the Compensation Clause (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25 [a]) by freezing judicial salaries while repeatedly increasing the salaries of almost all of the remaining state employees to keep pace with the cost of living. Relief was not warranted under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">United States v Hatter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (532 US 557, 121 S Ct 1782, 149 L Ed 2d 820 [2001]), which involved a Social Security tax law that discriminated against federal judges by reducing the compensation of judges only. The situation here did not involve any legislative enactment that directly or indirectly diminished judicial compensation. Moreover, although other state employees had received adjustments to account for inflation, judges were not the only state employees whose salaries have not been adjusted since judicial salaries were last increased.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Legislature -- Immunity from Prosecution -- Immunity under Speech or Debate Clause Not Available in Action Challenging Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. In a hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding/declaratory judgment action and two related declaratory judgment actions challenging the failure to adjust judicial compensation since 1998, the Assembly, Senate and the State were not immune under the Speech or Debate Clause from plaintiffs' violation of separation of powers claims. The Speech or Debate Clause protects against inquiry into acts that occur in the regular course of the legislative process and into the motivation for those acts, and applies to only &quot;members&quot; and to &quot;any speech or debate in either house&quot; (NY Const, art III, &sect; 11). Such immunity does not apply to either house of the Legislature as a whole. Moreover, no inquiry into acts that occurred in the regular course of the legislative process or the Legislature's motives for such acts was necessary here, as all of the parties acknowledged that the Judiciary was entitled to an increase in compensation, and the State defendants had made proclamations outside of the legislative and executive chambers as to why such an increase had not occurred.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation -- Separation of Powers Doctrine </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. In a hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding/declaratory judgment action challenging the failure to adjust judicial compensation since 1998, petitioners sufficiently stated a cause of action for violation of the Separation of Powers Doctrine. Petitioners alleged that by tying judicial compensation to unrelated legislative objectives and policy initiatives, as opposed to conducting an independent assessment of judicial compensation, the Legislature had disregarded the separation of powers doctrine and threatened the independence of the Judiciary. The compensation provisions in the State Constitution for each branch of government are separately addressed in the article for each respective branch, and not in the article where the powers of the legislative branch are articulated. Although a function of the Legislature is to approve the compensation of each of the three branches, the compensation to be paid to members of each particular branch must be determined separately and distinctly from the others. Whether the Judiciary is entitled to a compensation increase must be based upon an objective assessment of the Judiciary's needs if it is to retain its functional and structural independence. By failing to consider judicial compensation increases on the merits, and instead holding them hostage to other legislative objectives, the Legislature weakens the Judiciary by making it unduly dependent on the Legislature.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation -- Separation of Powers Doctrine </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8. In two related declaratory judgment actions challenging the failure to adjust judicial compensation since 1998, plaintiffs were entitled to a declaration that, as a matter of law, the State defendants' failure to consider judicial compensation on the merits violated the Separation of Powers Doctrine. The compensation provisions in the State Constitution for each branch of government are separately addressed in the article for each respective branch, and not in the article where the powers of the legislative branch are articulated.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation -- Separation of Powers Doctrine - Remedy for Violation of Separation of Powers Doctrine </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9. In two related declaratory judgment actions challenging the failure to adjust judicial compensation since 1998 resulting in a declaration that, as a matter of law, the State defendants' failure to consider judicial compensation on the merits violated the Separation of Powers Doctrine, it was not necessary to order specific injunctive relief. Deference to the Legislature regarding whether judicial compensation should be adjusted, and by how much, was necessary because it is in a far better position than the Judiciary to determine funding needs throughout the State and priorities for the allocation of the State's resources. Appropriate and expeditious legislative consideration of judicial compensation is, however, expected, and when addressed in present and future budget deliberations it cannot depend on unrelated policy initiatives or legislative compensation adjustments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Legislature's Failure to Increase Judicial Compensation -- Separation of Powers Doctrine -- Constitutional Inadequacy of Compensation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10. The Legislature has a constitutional duty and obligation to provide the Judiciary with compensation adequate in amount and commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of the judges involved. Moreover, adequate judicial compensation is necessary to ensure that the public will have its matters heard by competent judges and that judges will be free to issue decisions in accordance with the law without fear of retribution by the other two branches of government. The Compensation Clause's language that compensation &quot;shall not be diminished&quot; (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25 [a]) is not the opposite of an &quot;adequate compensation&quot; guarantee. The argument that the current salaries are inadequate when compared to other legal positions in the public and private sectors, as raised by plaintiffs in a declaratory judgment action challenging the Legislature's failure to adjust judicial compensation since 1998, is, however, one that is best addressed in the first instance by the Legislature. </SPAN></P>

The People argued that joinder was proper under CPL 200.20(2)(c) because the two offenses were the same or similar in law. The issue was whether the possession of stolen property count that was not charged in the felony complaint was the same or similar in law to the grand larceny offense so that its inclusion in the SCI on a joinder theory complied with CPL 195.20. The stolen property offense stemmed from defendant's possession of a stolen car. The grand larceny charge arose defendant's improper withdrawal of funds using a fraudulently obtained bank card. The appellate court held that the possession of stolen property charge was not sufficiently similar in law to be properly included in the waiver of indictment and the SCI.

The criminal possession offense was not properly joined with the grand larceny charge under CPL 195.20 and 200.20 (2) (c). CPL 200.20 (2) (c) permits joinder of charges involving a single defendant and arising from different criminal transactions if &quot;such offenses are defined by the same or similar statutory provisions and consequently are the same or similar in law.&quot; Here, the stolen property offense stemmed from the police discovering defendant in possession of a car that had previously been reported stolen, and the grand larceny charge arose from an incident in which defendant allegedly obtained a bank card by false pretenses and then withdrew funds from the victim's account without authorization. The only similarity was that both offenses involve misappropriated property. The crimes did not have comparable elements and the essential nature of the criminal conduct was quite distinct. The improper inclusion of the criminal possession offense in the waiver of indictment and SCI was a jurisdictional defect that, when raised on direct appeal, required reversal of the conviction and dismissal of the SCI. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Counsel -- Effective Representation -- Potential Conflict of Interest </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The potential conflict of interest that existed when one of defendant's attorneys was accused in court of joining with defendant in attempts to suborn perjury and to bribe a potential witness did not deprive defendant of the effective assistance of counsel. Defendant was fully informed of the potential conflict, and neither defendant nor his other attorney, who did not suffer from any alleged conflict, complained that the potentially conflicted attorney's continued representation of defendant operated on the defense. Further, defendant was simultaneously represented by his conflict-free attorney who was singlemindedly devoted to defendant's best interests. In light of the conflict-free attorney's active participation, defendant failed to establish that the potential conflict operated on the defense such that he was entitled to a new trial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Counsel -- Effective Representation -- Potential Conflict of Interest</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant failed to establish that the potential conflict of interest that existed when one of his attorneys was accused in court of joining with defendant in attempts to suborn perjury and to bribe a potential witness operated on the defense such that defendant was entitled to a new trial. Notwithstanding defendant's argument that the conflicted attorney, who presented the defense case, had to decide which witnesses to call and what questions to ask them, knowing that those decisions could affect his livelihood and liberty, defendant did not point to any evidence elicited by the conflicted attorney that was harmful to him. Defendant's allegations that the conflicted attorney did not present evidence that would have been helpful to his defense were speculative and unsubstantiated. There was no reason to believe that the prosecutor's application to disqualify the conflicted attorney dissuaded the defense from calling a witness who allegedly would have testified that the gun which defendant was charged with possessing belonged to an acquaintance of defendant. Defendant never attempted to show that the witness actually existed, and was willing to provide truthful and beneficial testimony. While the record on appeal was insufficient to establish that the witness might have given relevant and honest testimony, nothing prevented defendant from raising an ineffective assistance claim in a CPL 440.10 motion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Counsel -- Effective Representation -- Potential Conflict of Interest</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant's conviction of weapons crimes was not reversed notwithstanding the trial judge's failure to place on the record the follow-up discussions that must have taken place after the prosecutor asked the trial judge to disqualify one of defendant's attorneys due to a potential conflict of interest that existed because of the attorney's alleged attempts to suborn perjury and to bribe a potential witness. Defendant was not relieved of his obligation to demonstrate that the potential conflict of interest actually operated on the defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Counsel -- Effective Representation -- Potential Conflict of Interest</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Although defendant was not required to show that a potential conflict of interest, established when one of defendant's attorneys was accused in court of joining with defendant in attempts to suborn perjury and to bribe a potential witness, affected the trial's outcome, any potential conflict between defendant's and the conflicted attorney's interests, in fact, had no impact on defendant's conviction for weapons crimes. Defendant was acquitted of kidnapping--the only charge where any truthful testimony from the potential witness casting doubt on the credibility of defendant's acquaintance, whom he was with at the time of the charged crimes, would have been relevant--and attempted murder charges were ultimately dismissed after the jury failed to reach a verdict on those counts. Any possible testimony from the potential witness that the gun belonged to or was owned by the acquaintance would not negate evidence which conclusively established that defendant possessed a weapon with the intent to use it, and thus was guilty of the firearms crimes that he was convicted of committing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Counsel -- Effective Representation -- Potential Conflict of Interest</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A per se rule mandating reversal in situations where a defense attorney is accused of criminal misconduct directly related to the representation of the defendant is not necessary to protect a defendant's right to conflict-free representation. A defendant does not have to establish that the conflict affected the outcome of the proceedings; a defendant must only show that the conflict operated on the defense. Here, defendant failed to make this minimum showing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Persistent Violent Felony Offender -- Constitutionality of Prior Conviction -- Hearing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Defendant was not improperly denied a hearing to challenge a prior conviction on constitutional grounds in connection with his adjudication as a persistent violent felony offender. Defendant's unsupported allegations that he wanted to call numerous witnesses who, he claimed, would demonstrate that his &quot;guilty pleas were coerced&quot; and that his attorney was &quot;ineffective&quot; were insufficient to entitle defendant to a hearing on the constitutionality of his prior conviction (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 400.15). Defendant did not explain how his guilty pleas were coerced or in what way his attorney was ineffective. Nor did defendant indicate what information the named witnesses would provide on these issues. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after defendant hit the 83-year old complainant with &quot;something,&quot; the complainant moved to California to be near his children. The trial court held that the complainant was unavailable because he could not travel to New York without endangering his health.

The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that because CPL art. 65 addressed only a single, discrete circumstance, it left the trial court's pre-existing authority unaffected. The statutes providing for preservation of pre-trial testimony did not implicitly preclude the admission of live video testimony. Therefore, because the trial court did not abuse its inherent power and statutory authority under Judiciary Law &sect; 2-b by permitting the real-time, two-way video, defendant's federal and state confrontation rights were not impaired.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right of Confrontation -- Live Two-Way Televised Testimony -- Authority of Trial Court to Permit Televised Testimony of Adult Witness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Supreme Court had the authority to permit the adult complainant to testify at defendant's trial via live, two-way televised testimony following a finding of necessity. Although the Legislature has primary authority to regulate court procedure, the State Constitution permits the courts latitude to adopt procedures consistent with general practice as provided by statute. By enacting Judiciary Law &sect; 2-b (3), the Legislature has explicitly authorized the courts' use of innovative procedures where &quot;necessary to carry into effect the powers and jurisdiction possessed by [the court].&quot; There is no specific statutory authority evincing legislative policy proscribing televised testimony, and, in fact, the CPL requires live video testimony of a child witness in a prosecution of a sex crime after a judicial finding of &quot;vulnerability&quot; (CPL art 65). Because article 65 addresses only a single, discrete circumstance and otherwise leaves courts' preexisting authority unaffected (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 65.10 [3]), testimony via two-way televised transmission of a witness found to be elderly, infirm and physically incapable of appearing in court, as complainant was found to be by the trial court here, is presumably left to the trial court's discretion. Nor do the statutes providing for preservation of pretrial testimony implicitly preclude the admission of live video testimony. The CPL does not purport to list all instances where live video testimony is permissible or all possible solutions to the problem of an unavailable witness.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right of Confrontation -- Live Two-Way Televised Testimony -- Authority of Trial Court to Permit Televised Testimony of Adult Witness -- Exercise of Authority Following Finding of Necessity Permissible under Confrontation Clause </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The exercise of Supreme Court's authority to permit live, two-way televised testimony of the adult complainant following a finding of necessity was permissible under the Confrontation Clauses of both the Federal and State Constitutions (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art I, &sect; 6; US Const 6th Amend). Assuming without deciding that two-way video does not always satisfy the Confrontation Clause's face-to-face confrontation requirement, complainant's testimony here would nonetheless be admissible under the federal standard if findings of necessity and reliability were made by Supreme Court. Live two-way video may preserve the essential safeguards of testimonial reliability, and so satisfy the Confrontation Clause's primary concern with ensuring the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding before the trier of fact, provided all of the other elements of the confrontation right are preserved. Those traditional indicia of reliability, which include testimony under oath, the opportunity for contemporaneous cross-examination, and the opportunity for the judge, jury and defendant to view the witness's demeanor as he or she testifies, were all present here. Moreover, if Supreme Court's findings were supported by clear and convincing evidence, the requirement that an important public policy be furthered by the proposed procedure was satisfied. The public policy of justly resolving criminal cases while at the same time protecting the well-being of a witness can require live, two-way video testimony in the rare case where a key witness cannot physically travel to court in New York and where, as here, defendant's confrontation rights have been minimally impaired. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner owners appealed an order by the Appellate Division (New York) in favor of respondent condemnor; the owners claimed, inter alia, that the proposed taking of their property violated N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 7(a), art. XVIII, &sect; 6, and EDPL 207(C)(1) as it was not for a public use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The condemnor sought to use its eminent domain power to take certain privately owned properties for inclusion in a 22-acre mixed-use development proposed, and to be undertaken, by a private developer. The project would include a sports arena, various infrastructure improvements, and residential purposes, more than a third of which were to be affordable either for low and or middle income families. Although the area in which the project was to be situated was found to be substandard and unsanitary, two blocks and a fraction of a third had not previously been designated as blighted. The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that the owners had every right to include in their federal action a supplemental state law cause of action. Any limitation upon the sovereign power of eminent domain in the urban renewal context was a matter for the Legislature, not the courts. All that was at issue was a reasonable difference of opinion as to whether the area in question was in fact substandard and unsanitary, which was not a sufficient predicate to supplant the condemnor's determination. Accordingly, the public taking requirements of &sect;&sect; 7(a), 6, and 207(C)(1) were not violated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Limitation of Actions -- Commencement of Action after Termination of Prior Action -- Judicial Review of Eminent Domain Determination </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioners' proceeding pursuant to EDPL 207 challenging the condemnation of their properties, commenced more than 30 days after the determination's completion and publication but within six months of the dismissal of petitioners' federal court action challenging the determination, was timely. Although EDPL 207 (A) provides that a proceeding challenging an EDPL 204 condemnation determination must be filed in the appropriate Appellate Division within 30 days following the determination's completion and publication, the CPLR generally applies to EDPL proceedings, and CPLR 205 (a) effectively tolls the running of a statutory period to permit refiling within six months when an action has been timely commenced but dismissed on grounds other than those enumerated in the statute. Here, petitioners' initial challenge to respondent's determination was made in a timely federal court action asserting both federal constitutional claims and a pendant state claim seeking review of the determination pursuant to EDPL 207. The court rejected the federal claims and declined to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim, which was dismissed &quot;without prejudice to its being re-filed in state court&quot; and not upon any of the grounds enumerated in CPLR 205 (a). The EDPL does not, by prescribing a special limitations period within which review of condemnation determinations must be sought, strip a litigant of the benefit of CPLR 205 (a). Nor should policy considerations favoring expedition in condemnation proceedings deny litigants the remedial benefit of CPLR 205 (a), which itself implements the &quot;vitally important&quot; policy preference for the determination of actions on the merits. In actuality, it was not the availability of CPLR 205 (a) that delayed the condemnation here, but rather the availability of a federal forum. Moreover, the 30-day filing period prescribed in EDPL 207 (A) is merely a limitation upon the time within which a challenge to a condemnation determination may be brought, not a condition of maintaining any such challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Public Use -- Land Use Improvement Project -- Rehabilitation of Substandard and Insanitary Areas </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The determination authorizing the condemnation of petitioners' properties for inclusion in a land use improvement project proposed by a private developer upon findings by respondent urban development corporation that the area in which the project was to be situated was &quot;substandard and insanitary&quot; did not constitute a taking for the benefit of a private party in violation of article I, &sect; 7 (a) of the State Constitution. The Legislature has the power to provide for the rehabilitation of &quot;substandard and insanitary areas&quot; (NY Const, art XVIII, &sect; 1), and it may grant the power of eminent domain to any public corporation for such purpose (NY Const, art XVIII, &sect; 2). Respondent has been vested with the condemnation power by the Legislature, and sought to exercise the power here for the constitutionally recognized public purpose or &quot;use&quot; of rehabilitating a blighted area. Although there might have been a reasonable difference of opinion as to whether the area in question was in fact &quot;substandard and insanitary&quot; within the meaning of article XVIII, such a difference did not furnish a ground to afford petitioners relief. Whether a matter should be the subject of a public undertaking is ordinarily the province of the Legislature, and the actual specification of the uses identified by the Legislature as public has been largely left to quasi-legislative administrative agencies. Judges may not substitute their views as to the adequacy with which the public purpose of blight removal has been made out unless there is no room for reasonable difference of opinion as to whether an area is blighted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Public Use -- Land Use Improvement Project -- Occupancy Not Limited to Low Income Individuals </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a proceeding to review respondent urban development corporation's determination authorizing the condemnation of petitioners' properties for inclusion in a land use improvement project upon respondent's findings that the area in which the project was to be situated was &quot;substandard and insanitary,&quot; the housing units to be built as part of the project were not required to be reserved for low income tenants under article XVIII, &sect; 6 of the State Constitution. The principal, and independent, objectives of article XVIII were to facilitate the clearance of slums and the construction of low rent housing (NY Const, art XVIII, &sect; 1). The commitment of public funds to a land use improvement project involving housing construction does not effect a linkage of the article's otherwise independent purposes. Although article XVIII, &sect; 6, in referring to projects receiving state aid, states that occupancy &quot;shall be restricted to persons of low income&quot; and preference &quot;given to persons who live or shall have lived in&quot; the substandard and unsanitary area undergoing rehabilitation, the intention behind that provision was to provide for replacement of the housing units lost during slum clearance. Here, however, the project was not directed at the wholesale eradication of slums, but rather at alleviating relatively mild conditions of urban blight principally attributable to a large and uninhabited subgrade rail cut. The contemplated clearance would not cause direct displacement of large concentrations of low income individuals. The creation of low income housing, although a generally worthy objective, is not constitutionally required under article XVIII, &sect; 6 as an element of a land use improvement project that does not entail substantial slum clearance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, family members and legal services providers of inmates, appealed an order by the Appellate Division (New York) that dismissed as time barred their CPLR art. 78 action against respondent Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) for refund of a portion of a telephone charge allocated as a DOCS commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the DOCS' telephone calling system, the petitioners were charged a certain rate by the service provider, a percentage of which was paid to DOCS as a commission. The petitioners claimed that the commission constituted an illegal tax or fee, amounted to a government taking without just compensation, and violated their equal protection, free speech, and association rights. The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that the petitioners' constitutional challenges under N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, and art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 7(a), 8, and 11 lacked merit. The obligation to pay the commission was imposed on the provider, not the petitioners. Therefore, it was not a tax. A takings could not occur in the absence of government compulsion. The petitioners were in control of the length of the calls and, thus, the costs incurred. The hardship alleged by the petitioners was not a constitutionally significant curtailment of the free speech and association guarantee. Finally, the petitioners failed to show that DOCS engaged in an action that treated two similarly-situated classes of individuals differently. Accordingly, their art. 78 petition was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Separation of Powers -- Power to Tax - Challenge to Commissions Paid on Collect Calls by Inmates </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The collection by the Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) of a commission which represented a percentage of the revenues generated on each collect call placed by an inmate in a DOCS facility was neither a tax, in violation of the Separation of Powers Doctrine embedded in the New York Constitution (NY Const, art III, &sect; 1; art XVI, &sect; 1), nor an improper fee. The contractual obligation of the telephone services provider to remit the commission to DOCS constituted a permissible voluntary contractual arrangement between a governmental entity and the private sector. A per-call calculation commission is a standard method of compensating the owner of the property where a payphone is located. Although the provider intended to collect the total rate from call recipients, including the portion covering the commission, it owed the commission to DOCS regardless of whether it actually received payment from these consumers. The commission was not transformed into a tax or fee just because the provider passed this cost on to call recipients along with its other reasonable operating expenses. Notably, DOCS could not have collected the commission directly from the call recipient, which distinguished this scenario from a tax. The contractual arrangement related to DOCS' performance of a governmental function--the administration of the prison system--but it lacked the hallmarks of a tax or fee because DOCS did not compel petitioners to purchase services from the telephone services provider, nor are telephone services a government benefit. Finally, even if the DOCS commission were viewed as a tax, petitioners' claim for refunds would be barred because they failed to pay the rate under protest.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Taking of Property -- Challenge to Commissions Paid on Collect Calls by Inmates </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The collection by the Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) of a commission which represented a percentage of the revenues generated on each collect call placed by an inmate in a DOCS facility was not a &quot;taking&quot; without just compensation in violation of New York Constitution, article I, &sect; 7 (a). A &quot;taking&quot; cannot occur in the absence of government compulsion. Petitioners, legal services providers who represent prisoners and individuals who had accepted collect telephone calls from family members incarcerated in DOCS facilities, were not compelled to pay anything to DOCS or to the telephone services provider, nor was their money or other property confiscated by the state. The acceptance of collect calls was voluntary action and, by taking the calls, petitioners agreed to pay the associated rate. Nor was there any appropriation of private property without &quot;just compensation&quot; because, in exchange for their payments, petitioners received telephone services. The New York Constitution did not require DOCS to ensure that petitioners received telephone services at the lowest possible expense.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Challenge to Commissions Paid on Collect Calls by Inmates </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a combined declaratory judgment action and proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 challenging the collection by the Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) of a commission which represented a percentage of the revenues generated on each collect call placed by an inmate in a DOCS facility, petitioners, legal services providers who represent prisoners and individuals who had accepted collect telephone calls from family members incarcerated in DOCS facilities, failed to state a viable claim under the Free Speech and Association Clause (NY Const, art I, &sect; 8). Notwithstanding petitioners' allegation that the increased cost of inmate calls resulting from the DOCS commission impaired their constitutionally protected right to speak to and associate with their incarcerated loved ones or clients, petitioners did not allege that the commission was so high that it substantially impaired the limited right of inmates to contact and associate with family members or legal services providers and that the commission bore no reasonable relationship to legitimate penological aims. While inmates have a constitutional right to communicate with the outside world, this does not equate to a right to use a specific means for such communication--the telephone--much less to guarantee telephone services at a particular cost. Inasmuch as alternate means of communication were available to New York inmates and their families, with mail offered at low or no cost, the additional expense associated with the DOCS commission on telephone calls did not imperil the right of inmates to communicate with others.  </SPAN></P>

In a combined declaratory judgment action and proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 challenging the collection by the Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) of a commission which represented a percentage of the revenues generated on each collect call placed by an inmate in a DOCS facility, petitioners, legal services providers who represent prisoners and individuals who had accepted collect telephone calls from family members incarcerated in DOCS facilities, failed to state a cognizable equal protection claim (NY Const, art I, &sect; 11). Petitioners alleged that they had been forced to pay DOCS commissions, which were used by DOCS to fund the New York prison system, even though they were situated no differently from other New York residents. There was no category of individuals situated similarly to petitioners that could be used as a basis for comparison. All recipients of inmate calls were treated the same way under the contract between DOCS and the telephone services provider.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two cases, appellant taxpayers challenged actions by respondents officials and department that recognized out-of-state same-sex marriages for public employee benefits purposes. One case was dismissed and the department was awarded summary judgment the other action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers in the first case claimed, pursuant to General Municipal Law &sect; 51, that one of the officials illegally legislated in the areas of marriage and domestic relations by issuing an executive order relating to recognition of out-of-state same-sex marriages. However, the taxpayers alleged no fraud. Further, the complaint did not identify a specific impact that the executive order had on a public employee or private individual in the county. This lack of specificity was fatal to the claim. The county already insured same-sex domestic partners and dependents of county employees before the executive order. In the other case, the taxpayers invoked State Finance Law &sect; 123-b and the separation of powers doctrine. However, the department had offered health benefits to domestic partners since the mid-1990s, and the taxpayers failed to state a claim. Although the taxpayers alleged that the department's actions violated Civil Service Law &sect; 164, the statute itself refuted the claim. The President of the Civil Service Commission had broad discretion to define who qualified for coverage. There was no conflict between the Civil Service Law and the department's challenged memorandum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action challenging an Executive Order (Westchester County Executive Order No. 3 of 2006) which recognized out-of-state same-sex marriages for purposes of public employee health insurance coverage and other benefits, plaintiff taxpayers failed to allege an unlawful expenditure of taxpayer funds, and thus did not state a cognizable claim under General Municipal Law &sect; 51. Plaintiffs did not identify any specific impact that the Executive Order had on any public employee or private individual in the County, and failed to specify a circumstance where taxpayer funds were expended as a result of the Executive Order that would not have been expended in the absence of the order. The County had already insured same-sex domestic partners and dependents of county employees before the Executive Order was issued, requiring only that applicants for domestic partner coverage have lived with their domestic partners in a committed financially interdependent relationship for at least a year.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action challenging a Policy Memorandum issued by the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Civil Service which recognized out-of-state same-sex marriages for purposes of public employee health insurance coverage and other benefits, plaintiff taxpayers failed to state a cause of action under State Finance Law &sect; 123-b since they failed to allege an unlawful expenditure of taxpayer funds. Plaintiffs made conclusory allegations that defendants &quot;are expending and will expend State funds and/or resources supplied from New York State tax revenue,&quot; without claiming specific expenditures that would not otherwise have been incurred. While a taxpayer may bring suit under this statute to prevent the unlawful expenditure of state funds &quot;whether or not such person is or may be affected or specially aggrieved&quot; (State Finance Law &sect; 123-b [1]), there must be some specific threat of an imminent expenditure. The Department of Civil Service had offered New York State Health Insurance Program benefits to domestic partners since the mid-1990s.  </SPAN></P>

A Policy Memorandum issued by the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Civil Service recognizing out-of-state same-sex marriages for purposes of public employee health insurance coverage and other benefits, was not in conflict with Civil Service Law &sect; 164, which provides for health insurance to the spouses and dependent children of state officers and employees. It was clear, from the plain language of the statute and from the legislative history, that the Legislature intended to give the Department of Civil Service--guided by the collective bargaining process--complete discretion to determine the limits of dependent coverage, provided that, at a minimum, spouses and dependent children were covered. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff senators sued defendants, the governor, secretary of state, and nominee for the office of lieutenant-governor, challenging the governor's appointment of the nominee as lieutenant-governor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor relied on Public Officers Law &sect; 43 in making the appointment.

The intermediate appellate court certified a question. The appellate court found that, while, generally, election was the preferred means of filling vacancies in elective office, the elective principle was not preeminent when it came to filling a vacancy in the office of lieutenant-governor. Public Officers Law &sect; 43 afforded the governor the authority to fill a vacancy in that office by appointment. N.Y. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6 was not a limitation on gubernatorial appointment pursuant to &sect; 43, but merely stated what was to occur while there was a vacancy; it did not, and could not have, consistent with the command of N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Governor -- Powers of Governor -- Authority to Appoint Lieutenant Governor to Fill Vacancy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Governor had the authority, pursuant to Public Officers Law &sect; 43, to fill a vacancy in the office of Lieutenant Governor by appointment. The State Constitution specifies that &quot;[t]he legislature shall provide for filling vacancies in office&quot; (NY Const, art XIII, &sect; 3), and expressly contemplates that vacancies in elective office may be filled by appointment. In pursuance of the constitutional mandate imposed by article XIII, &sect; 3, the Legislature enacted Public Officers Law &sect;&sect; 41, 42 and 43, three comprehensive and complementary provisions. Public Officers Law &sect; 43, the catchall provision for vacancies not otherwise covered by sections 41 and 42, was applicable here and states that if a vacancy in an elective office occurs &quot;otherwise than by expiration of term, with no provision of law for filling the same,&quot; the Governor &quot;shall appoint a person to execute the duties thereof until the vacancy shall be filled by an election.&quot; Here, the position of Lieutenant Governor became vacant when the previous Governor resigned and the current Governor, who was the Lieutenant Governor at that time, became Governor for the remainder of his predecessor's term. There was no provision of law, apart from Public Officers Law &sect; 43, for filling the vacancy. Although article IV, &sect; 6 of the State Constitution authorizes the temporary president of the Senate to perform all the Lieutenant Governor's duties if the Lieutenant Governor is not able to do so or the office is vacant, that direction applies only &quot;during [the] vacancy or inability.&quot; It cannot fill or end the vacancy, and is not a limitation upon gubernatorial appointment pursuant to Public Officers Law &sect; 43. Nor does article XIII, &sect;3's proviso that &quot;no person appointed to fill a vacancy [in elective office] shall hold his or her office by virtue of such appointment longer than the commencement of the political year next succeeding the first annual election after the happening of the vacancy&quot; prevent the Governor from appointing a Lieutenant Governor, as that provision demands only that a vacancy in an elective office be filled by election in the shortest space of time reasonably possible. Moreover, although election is generally the preferred means of filling vacancies in elective office, the elective principle is not preeminent when it comes to filling a vacancy in the office of Lieutenant Governor. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court permanently enjoined respondents, the State of New York, the Office of the New York State Comptroller, and the Comptroller, from auditing appellant charter schools, holding that General Municipal Law &sect; 33(2) and Education Law &sect; 2854(1)(c), which authorized such audits, violated N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Education Law &sect; 2854(1)(c) required charter schools to be subject to the State Comptroller's audit just like other public schools. General Municipal Law &sect; 33 required the Comptroller to cause the accounts of all charter schools in the State to be examined by March 31, 2010. The schools contended that assignment to the Comptroller of the power and duty to audit charter schools violated N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 because charter schools were not political subdivisions of the State, nor was the task of auditing charter schools an administrative duty that was incidental to the Comptroller's constitutionally prescribed functions. The high court agreed. Audits of charter schools--which were not political subdivisions--could not be construed as incidental to the audits of school districts. N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 stated that the legislature could assign to the Comptroller no administrative duties, &quot;excepting such as may be incidental to the performance of&quot; the functions set forth therein.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assignment to the State Comptroller of the power and duty to audit charter schools violated article V, &sect; 1 of the New York State Constitution. Article V, &sect; 1 gives the Legislature the authority to delegate to the Comptroller the power and duty to supervise the accounts of any political subdivision of the State, and provides that the Comptroller shall not be assigned administrative duties, except those incidental to the performance of his or her functions. Charter schools are not political subdivisions of the State, nor is the task of auditing charter schools an administrative duty incidental to the Comptroller's constitutionally prescribed functions. Accordingly, the provisions of General Municipal Law &sect; 33 (2) and Education Law &sect; 2854 (1) (c), to the extent that they direct the Comptroller to conduct audits of charter schools, are unconstitutional. The Legislature has designated the Board of Regents and the charter entities as the public agents authorized to supervise and oversee charter schools. Audits of charter schools--not political subdivisions--cannot be construed as incidental to the audits of school districts authorized by the Legislature (L 2005, ch 267; General Municipal Law &sect; 33 [2]). The plainly expressed constitutional prohibition of article V, &sect; 1 does not support such an expansive reading of the term &quot;incidental.&quot; The Comptroller, as the State's chief fiscal officer, has not been authorized to audit the management and operations of an entity--not a political subdivision--solely on the basis that it receives State funds and performs a governmental function. An audit of the performance of charter schools could not be considered to be within an audit of the monies paid by a school district acting as a mere conduit by forwarding the funds necessary to pay a student's tuition. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order by the Appellate Term (New York), which affirmed his conviction of failing to comply with a posted sign indicating a city park's closing time; defendant claimed, inter alia, that assignment of his case to a judicial hearing officer (JHO) pursuant to CPL 350.20 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant apparently signed a form explaining that his case was being referred to a JHO for trial and/or final disposition and sentence. The form explicitly stated that defendant had the right to adjudicate the case before a criminal court judge. Further, the form listed the scope of the JHO's authority as derived from CPL 350.20. The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that since consent was a prerequisite to JHO adjudication, nothing in N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 15(a) prohibited the Legislature from enacting CPL 350.20. Upon balancing the interests of the parties, the contested procedures, and the government's stake in the outcome, CPL 350.20 did not violate either the federal or state due process clause. CPL 350.20's consensual JHO adjudication procedure adequately protected defendant's interest in a fair trial. Accordingly, defendant's constitutional arguments failed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Trial -- Assignment to Judicial Hearing Officer -- State Constitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. CPL 350.20, which permits class B misdemeanors to be tried and determined by judicial hearing officers (JHOs) &quot;upon agreement of the parties,&quot; does not violate the provision of the New York Constitution establishing the New York City Criminal Court and setting certain qualifications for that court's judges (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 15 [a]). Consensual JHO adjudication was intended to contribute to the goal of reducing pernicious calendar congestion, thereby fostering the more efficient administration of criminal justice. The jury trial rights of the defendant here, who was charged with a class B misdemeanor, were not threatened, as he would have had a bench trial had the parties not consented to have the matter adjudicated by a JHO. As the Legislature envisioned when enacting CPL 350.20, the trial of defendant's case represented the sort of referral upon the consent of the parties that has long been permitted in this state. Nothing in article VI, &sect; 15 (a) prohibited the Legislature from enacting CPL 350.20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Trial -- Assignment to Judicial Hearing Officer -- Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. CPL 350.20, which permits class B misdemeanors to be tried and determined by judicial hearing officers (JHOs) &quot;upon agreement of the parties,&quot; does not violate the Due Process Clauses of the State or Federal Constitutions. Defendant's due process interest in his class B misdemeanor prosecution was not that of having his case determined by a &quot;judge,&quot; but rather that of having a fair trial in a fair tribunal. There is nothing in the nature of a consensual JHO adjudication that gives rise to any substantial concern that the presiding JHO would lack the neutrality that is a fundamental command of due process. Prospective JHOs are carefully evaluated prior to appointment for potentially renewable one-year terms and are subject to performance evaluations and removal for unsatisfactory performance. Those and other safeguards, when combined with the consensual nature of JHO adjudication under CPL 350.20 and the availability of appellate review, adequately protected defendant's due process right to a fair tribunal. Moreover, the governmental interest in ensuring the maintenance of a carefully-vetted, highly-qualified staff of JHOs standing ready to fairly and efficiently adjudicate petty criminal cases is substantial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Trial -- Assignment to Judicial Hearing Officer -- Validity of Consent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The consent to adjudication of defendant's class B misdemeanor trial by a judicial hearing officer (JHO) pursuant to CPL 350.20 was valid, as defense counsel participated fully in the trial held before a JHO without objection and the court file contained a JHO consent form signed by defendant. Unlike other statutes governing waivers of rights in criminal proceedings, CPL 350.20 (1) requires the &quot;parties['] agreement,&quot; not defendant's personal consent. Moreover, the decision whether to agree to JHO adjudication of a petty criminal case represents the sort of tactical decision best left to the determination of counsel. It was not necessary for the trial court to have engaged defendant in an oral colloquy regarding whether he understood the effect of the signed JHO consent form.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Information -- Sufficiency of Allegations of Violation of New York City Parks and Recreation Department Rules</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The information charging defendant with being in a New York City park after the park's posted closing time in violation of New York City Parks and Recreation Department Rules (56 RCNY) &sect; 1-03 (c) (2), prepared by the police officer who had observed defendant in the park after hours, was facially sufficient. Although the rule contains qualifying language stating that a person may disregard a park sign &quot;upon order by a Police Officer or designated Department employee,&quot; it was not necessary that the information state whether that portion of the rule applied to defendant. The qualifying language was not a true &quot;exception&quot; that must be pleaded by the People, but rather a &quot;proviso&quot; that defendant was required to raise as a bar to prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and the son challenged the curfew on constitutional and non-constitutional grounds. The appellate court addressed only the arguments addressing the substantive due process rights of minors to enjoy freedom of movement and the substantive due process rights of parents to control the upbringing of their children. Because the purpose of the curfew was, in part, to prevent victimization of minors, it was within the realm of the government's legitimate concern. Intermediate scrutiny was proper. However, the curfew was constitutionally infirm. The proof offered by the city failed to show the necessary nexus between the curfew and the stated purposes of Rochester, N.Y., City Code ch. 45. Incidents cited by the city would not have been prevented by the curfew because two of the victims were killed during hours outside the curfew and the third was already subject to an individualized curfew.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Academic and Moot Questions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action challenging the validity of a city ordinance which established a nighttime curfew for minors under the age of 17 was not rendered moot when plaintiff turned 17, because he could still be detained under the curfew if, to a police officer, he appeared to be under 17 and failed to offer proof of his age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Ordinance -- Juvenile Curfew</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A city ordinance establishing a juvenile nighttime curfew violated plaintiff minor's federal and state constitutional due process rights to freedom of movement, and plaintiff parent's federal and state constitutional due process rights to control the upbringing of his children. Notwithstanding that the City, pursuant to its broad police powers, had the authority to enact a curfew ordinance, the ordinance was constitutionally infirm under the applicable intermediate scrutiny analysis, pursuant to which defendants were required to show that the ordinance was substantially related to the achievement of important government interests. While defendants' governmental interest was to prevent minors from perpetrating and becoming victims of crime during nighttime hours, the proof offered by the City failed to support the aims of the curfew. The incidents that led to the enactment of the ordinance, the deaths of three minors, would not have been prevented by the curfew and thus did not provide the necessary nexus between the curfew and the ordinance's stated purpose. Further, the crime statistics produced by defendants did not support the objectives of the curfew. Moreover, the curfew imposed an unconstitutional burden on a parent's substantive due process rights because it failed to offer parents enough flexibility or autonomy in supervising their children. An exception allowing for parental consent to the activities of minors during curfew hours is of paramount importance to the due process rights of parents. Absent such exception, the challenged curfew was not substantially related to the stated goals of promoting parental supervision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit filed a certified question to decide whether it could order defendant bank, over which it had personal jurisdiction, to deliver stock certificates owned by defendant judgment debtor (or cash equal to their value) to plaintiff judgment creditor, pursuant to CPLR art. 52, when the stock certificates were located outside New York.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the judgment creditor was awarded a default judgment in Maryland against the judgment debtor, his former business partner, the creditor duly registered the judgment in New York. Thereafter, the creditor filed a petition against the bank to deliver the certificates, which the debtor had pledged as collateral for a loan, to him. However, the bank revealed that the stock certificates were no longer in its possession. The obligations for which the bank had held the certificates as collateral had been satisfied and the bank--despite the District Court's turnover order--had transferred the stock to a Bermudan company existing for the debtor's benefit. The District Court then dismissed the creditor's petition, inter alia, for lack of in rem jurisdiction over the debtor's shares. The Court of Appeals found that because the New York court had personal jurisdiction over the bank, it could order it to turn over out-of-state property regardless of whether the bank was a judgment debtor or a garnishee, pursuant to CPLR 5225(b).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A court sitting in New York may order a bank over which it has personal jurisdiction to deliver stock certificates owned by a judgment debtor (or cash equal to their value) to a judgment creditor, pursuant to CPLR article 52, when those stock certificates are located outside New York. CPLR article 52 governs the enforcement of money judgments and orders directing the payment of money. Such postjudgment enforcement requires only jurisdiction over persons, as opposed to prejudgment attachment which is typically based on jurisdiction over property. CPLR article 52 contains no express territorial limitation barring the entry of a turnover order that requires a garnishee to transfer money or property into New York from another state or country, and recent legislation supports the conclusion that the Legislature intended CPLR article 52 to have extraterritorial reach. Further, bearing in mind the fundamental differences between postjudgment enforcement and prejudgment attachment, a New York court with personal jurisdiction over a defendant may order him to turn over out-of-state property regardless of whether the defendant is a judgment debtor or a garnishee. </SPAN></P>

The resident aliens alleged that the agency failed to provide assistance consistent &sect; 209(2) based solely on their immigration status. The appellate court found, however, that N.Y. Const. art. XVII did not compel the state to assume the federal government's obligation when a person became ineligible for continued SSI/ASP benefits. The alienage restriction of &sect; 209(1)(a)(iv) was mandated by PRWORA. In conforming the state statute to mirror the federal law, New York did not create a classification along suspect lines. Because the state did not create a program which excluded the resident aliens, levels of scrutiny were inapplicable and there was no equal protection violation.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs, who were aged, blind or disabled persons and legal resident aliens who became ineligible for federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits and additional state payments (ASP) because they did not become citizens in the time frame mandated in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Pub L 104-193 tit IV, codified at 8 USC &sect; 1601 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) or were never eligible for SSI/ASP by virtue of the act, were not entitled to receive safety net assistance benefits (Social Services Law &sect;131-a [2]) in an amount equal to the level set forth in Social Services Law &sect;209 (2) for aged, blind or disabled citizens. ASP is not a stand-alone program which sets a &quot;standard of need&quot; for all aged, blind or disabled individuals within the state. Rather, it is a supplement to the SSI program established by the federal government and Social Services Law &sect; 209 (2), and merely sets forth &quot;the standard of monthly need for determining eligibility for and the amount of additional state payments.&quot; Although NY Constitution, article XVII, &sect; 1 requires the State to provide for the aid, care and support of the needy, it does not mandate that public assistance must be granted on an individual basis in every instance or that the legitimate needs of each public assistance recipient be fully met.

In general, state laws that create alienage classifications when distributing or regulating economic benefits are strictly scrutinized. The strict scrutiny test, however, is to be invoked only where a challenged law can be said to create classifications drawn along suspect lines. Here, the alienage restriction embodied in Social Services Law &sect; 209 (1) (a) (iv) was mandated by federal law (PRWORA), and in conforming the New York statute to mirror the federal law, the State did not create a program of benefits which excluded plaintiffs. The right to equal protection does not require the State to create a new public assistance program in order to guarantee equal outcomes under wholly separate and distinct public benefit programs. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) that upheld the denial of his motion to suppress the evidence obtained from a global positioning system (GPS) tracking device; defendant claimed that his constitutional rights were violated by the warrantless placement and use of the device.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the early morning hours, a state police investigator crept underneath defendant's street-parked van and placed a GPS tracking device inside the bumper. The device remained in place for 65 days, constantly monitoring the position of the van. The device's battery required replacement during the monitoring period, which resulted in yet another nocturnal visit by the investigator to the van's undercarriage. The nonstop surveillance was conducted without a warrant. Thereafter, the GPS readings were admitted at defendant's burglary trial. The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that the GPS surveillance was not a mere enhancement of human sensory capacity. The residual privacy expectation that defendant retained in his vehicle, while perhaps small, was at least adequate to support his claim of a violation of his N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. The search was illegal because it was executed without a warrant and without justification under any exception to the warrant requirement. Accordingly, defendant's motion to suppress should not have been denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The placement by police of a global positioning system (GPS) tracking device inside the bumper of defendant's street-parked van and constant monitoring of the position of the van for 65 days, all without a warrant or justification under any exception to the warrant requirement, constituted an illegal search under New York Constitution, article I, &sect; 12. Although the expectation of privacy has been deemed diminished in a car upon a public thoroughfare, expectations of privacy when driving or riding in a vehicle are not so utterly diminished that the occupants effectively consent to the unsupervised disclosure to law enforcement authorities of all that GPS technology can reveal. The residual privacy expectation defendant retained in his vehicle, while perhaps small, was at least adequate to support his claim of a violation of his constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures, and the massive invasion of privacy entailed by the prolonged use of the GPS device was inconsistent with even the slightest reasonable expectation of privacy. Under the New York Constitution, in the absence of exigent circumstances, the installation and use of a GPS device to monitor an individual's whereabouts requires a warrant supported by probable cause. Exigent circumstances did not exist here and it was impossible to discern from the record any reason, apart from hunch or curiosity, for its placement. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the trial court mentioned that the sentence would include postrelease supervision (PRS) at the time of the plea, the trial court failed to advise defendant of the specific term of PRS. The appellate court found that this deficiency was apparent from the record of the plea proceeding. A post allocution motion was not required to challenge the sufficiency of the plea. The People argued that, even if it were necessary to vacate defendant's plea and sentence, pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 70.85, defendant should have been resentenced to his original 12-year determinate sentence without PRS. The appellate found, however, that this corrective action should not have been entertained at this time because the constitutionality of this new provision and its applicability to this case had not been sufficiently developed for appellate review. The issue of whether the deficiency in the plea allocution could have been rectified by granting defendant specific performance of the plea agreement-a determinate sentence without imposing a term of PRS-should have been determined by the trial court in the first instance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A postallocution motion was not required to challenge the sufficiency of defendant's plea of guilty where Supreme Court mentioned at the plea proceeding that defendant's determinate sentences would include a period of postrelease supervision but failed at sentencing to advise defendant of the exact duration of such supervision.</SPAN></P>

The plea allocution in a prosecution for robbery was deficient where Supreme Court mentioned at the plea proceeding that defendant's determinate sentences would include a period of postrelease supervision (PRS) but failed at sentencing to advise defendant of the exact duration of such supervision. A criminal defendant has a right to hear directly from the court its pronouncement as to what the entire sentence encompasses. The combined command of CPL 380.20 and 380.40 is that the sentencing judge--and only the sentencing judge--is authorized to pronounce the PRS component of a defendant's sentence. Notwithstanding the enactment of Penal Law &sect; 70.85, which avoids the need for pleas to be vacated when the District Attorney consents to resentencing without a term of PRS, the constitutionality of this new provision and its applicability herein had not been sufficiently developed for review by the Court of Appeals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an Appellate Division (New York) decision, which affirmed his conviction for burglary in the third degree under Penal Law &sect; 140.20 and which concluded that defendant's Apprendi challenge to the imposition of a recidivist sentence under Penal Law &sect; 70.10 and CPL 400.20 lacked merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 18 years to life pursuant to CPL 400.20(5) and Penal Law &sect; 70.10(1)(a) based on his four prior felony convictions. On appeal, the court affirmed. The determination of whether the police possessed reasonable suspicion to stop and detain defendant was beyond further review as it was not disturbed by the appellate division and was supported by the record. In light of a recent U.S. Supreme Court case, New York's discretionary persistent felony offender sentencing scheme did not violate defendant's right to, inter alia, a trial by jury under the Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VI, because prior felony convictions were the sole determinant of eligibility for recidivist sentencing. Once prior felony convictions were proven, the courts properly had the discretion to determine whether an enhanced sentence, within the statutorily prescribed sentencing range, was warranted. The improper sentencing schemes in Apprendi and its progeny all provided for judicial factfinding of an element of an offense as a prerequisite to enhancing a sentence beyond the relevant sentencing range.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The decision of the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Cunningham v California</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (549 US 270, 127 S Ct 856, 166 L Ed 2d 856 [2007]), holding that California's determinate sentencing law violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Apprendi v New Jersey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 [2000]), because it authorized the judge to find facts exposing defendant to an elevated upper term sentence, did not render New York's discretionary persistent felony offender sentencing scheme unconstitutional. New York's sentencing scheme (Penal Law &sect; 70.10; CPL 400.20) is a recidivist sentencing scheme pursuant to which a defendant is subject to an enhanced sentence based solely on the existence of two prior felony convictions. It is only after a defendant's eligibility for an enhanced sentence is determined that a judge is given the discretion to choose the appropriate sentence within a sentencing range prescribed by statute. Sentencing schemes allowing for such discretion are permissible under the Sixth Amendment. New York's sentencing scheme, by requiring that sentencing courts consider defendant's &quot;history and character&quot; and the &quot;nature and circumstances&quot; of defendant's conduct in deciding where, within a range, to impose an enhanced sentence, sets the parameters for the performance of one of the sentencing court's most traditional and basic functions, i.e., the exercise of sentencing discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants committed, or attempted to commit, kidnaping and unlawful imprisonment in separate cases. Their victims were children, and defendants were not their victims' parents. Defendants' complaint was with the name under which they were registered. The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that the defendants were all within the definition of &quot;sex offender&quot; in SORA. While defendants might be asserting a liberty interest, their right not to have a misleading label attached to their serious crimes was not fundamental. The Legislature had a rational basis for concluding that, in the large majority of cases where people kidnapped or unlawfully imprisoned other people's children, the children either were sexually assaulted or were in danger of sexual assault. Considering that no fundamental right was at stake, the Legislature could constitutionally provide that all those convicted of kidnaping or unlawfully imprisoning children not their own, or of attempting to commit those crimes, be conclusively deemed sex offenders. Accordingly, defendants' right to due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.Y. Const. art I. &sect; 6 was not violated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. No violation of defendants' constitutional rights occurred when defendants, who were convicted of committing or attempting to commit kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment of children not their own, were required to register as sex offenders under the Sex Offender Registration Act (Correction Law &sect;168 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.), even though there was no proof that their crimes involved any sexual act or sexual motive. While it may be assumed that defendants have a constitutionally-protected liberty interest, applicable in a substantive due process context, in not being required to register under an incorrect label, defendants were not asserting a &quot;fundamental right,&quot; as due process cases use that term. Where no fundamental right is infringed, legislation is valid if it is rationally related to legitimate government interests. The Legislature had a rational basis for concluding that, in the large majority of cases where people kidnap or unlawfully imprison other people's children, the children either are sexually assaulted or are in danger of sexual assault. In light of this, it was rational for the Legislature to provide that, as a general rule, people guilty of such crimes should be classified as &quot;sex offenders.&quot; Thus, the classification is not unconstitutional on its face. Nor is it unconstitutional to apply the definition to the minority of cases in which there was neither a sexual assault nor any discernible risk of one. The Legislature could rationally have found that the administrative burden, and the risk that some dangerous sex offenders would escape registration, justified a hard and fast rule, with no exceptions.  </SPAN></P>

In light of defendant's long record of violent conduct, including sexual violence, it was not an abuse of discretion to conclude that there was a high risk that he would commit a sex crime in the future. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of attempted second-degree murder under Penal Law &sect;&sect; 110.00, 125.25(1), first-degree assault under Penal Law &sect; 120.10(1), and criminal possession of a weapon in the second and third degrees under Penal Law &sect;&sect; 265.03(2), 265.02(4) (now Penal Law &sect; 265.03(3). The supreme court (New York) sentenced defendant as a persistent violent felony offender to an aggregate term of 25 years to life. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the appellate court was whether defendant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his allegation that one of his predicate felony convictions was secured in violation of his constitutional right to counsel. The appellate court concluded that the supreme court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant an adjournment to gather further evidence. Defendant admitted that he received the People's predicate violent felony conviction statement at his arraignment, four months prior to sentencing. Further, the supreme court was willing to hold an evidentiary hearing based on defendant's claim that his counsel did not participate in the predicate felony trial. The appellate court concluded, however, that the supreme court did not err in denying defendant's request for an adjournment, as defendant merely cited the unavailability of the minutes from the predicate felony trial and could not give specifics about the predicate felony trial. Contrary to defendant's contention, the appellate court also concluded that admission of evidence of defendant's other gun-related offenses was highly probative of his intent given that he claimed the shooting was accidental.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Persistent Violent Felony Offender -- Challenge to Predicate Felony Conviction </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Supreme Court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request at his sentencing for an adjournment in order to &quot;file motions,&quot; presumably aimed at gathering evidence to prove that one of his prior felony convictions was secured in violation of his constitutional right to counsel and therefore could not serve as a basis for sentencing him as a persistent violent felony offender. Defendant had received the People's predicate violent felony conviction statement four months earlier, and CPL 400.15 (6) puts defense counsel who controvert an allegation in a predicate violent felony conviction statement on notice to be prepared to proceed with an evidentiary hearing so long as the statement is received at least two days before the preliminary examination. While it may not always be feasible for counsel to obtain minutes or other documents in time for a hearing that immediately follows a preliminary examination, defense counsel here did not suggest that he had made any effort to obtain the minutes from the relevant prior trial, or even specifically request the adjournment for the purpose of procuring the minutes. Nor did counsel provide the judge with an affidavit from the attorney who represented defendant in the earlier trial, or secure that attorney's live testimony, but rather simply asserted that the attorney completely failed to participate in the earlier trial. Defendant, however, was concededly tried in absentia at that trial, giving rise to an inference that the attorney's nonparticipation was a protest strategy that would not support a claim of ineffective assistance.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Proof of Prior Convictions -- Prior Gun-Related Convictions Relevant to Defendant's Claim That Shooting Was Accidental </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In the prosecution of defendant for attempted second-degree murder, first-degree assault, and criminal possession of a weapon in the second and third degrees in connection with a shooting incident, Supreme Court did not err by permitting the jury to consider evidence that defendant, who had confessed to the shooting but claimed that the revolver discharged accidentally, had previously been convicted of three gun-related offenses. The evidence of defendant's prior gun-related convictions was highly probative of his intent, given that he claimed that the shooting was accidental, and had at least suggested in a videotaped statement admitted at trial that he was unaccustomed to handling firearms. Moreover, the witnesses to the shooting were extremely impeachable. Supreme Court limited the potential for prejudice by reading into the record a bare-bones stipulation consisting only of the conviction dates, the names of the crimes and, in two cases, the type of gun involved, and by repeatedly instructing the jurors to consider that evidence only in relation to the issue of accident, not propensity. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of attempted burglary in the second, Penal Law &sect; 140.25(2) and third degrees, Penal Law &sect; 140.20, two counts of criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree, Penal Law &sect; 165.45(2), and possession of burglar's tools. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, First Department affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers saw defendant in a doorway of an office &quot;poking&quot; at the lock with a knife. Defendant was apprehended after a brief chase, and a search of defendant's person discovered, inter alia, items which were stolen in two earlier home burglaries. The trial court allowed the People to introduce detailed testimony regarding the uncharged burglaries and further provided a limiting instruction, without telling the jury for what purpose the evidence had been admitted or how they should evaluate it. There was no evidence, however, that defendant committed the prior burglaries, and the appellate court found that the evidence as to the uncharged burglaries had no bearing other than to show that defendant was of a criminal bent or character and thus likely to have committed the crime charged. The trial court erred by failing to issue a limiting instruction to cure the potential prejudicial effect of the evidence regarding the uncharged burglaries on the attempted burglary and possession of burglar's tools counts, and should have advised the jury that it could not consider the prior burglaries with respect to the attempted burglary and possession of burglar's tools counts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the intermediate appellate court was modified by reversing the convictions of attempted burglary in the second and third degrees and criminal possession of burglar's tools.

Supreme Court should have advised the jury that it could consider the evidence for the possession of stolen property counts, but that it could not consider the prior burglaries with respect to the attempted burglary and possession of burglar's tools counts. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent diocese sued appellant parish, seeking, among other relief, a judgment that the parish's real and personal property was impressed with a trust in favor of the diocese and a national church.

The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, Fourth Department, affirmed. The parish appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The diocese had approved a resolution declaring the parish ecclesiastically extinct, and sought return of property held by the parish. The diocese argued that the parish agreed to abide by the constitution and canons of the diocese and was, therefore, subject to the trust doctrine of those canons. The appellate court found that nothing in the deeds, the parish's certificate of incorporation, or the Religious Corporation Law established an express trust. However, certain of the diocese's canons clearly established an express trust in favor of the diocese and the national church, and the parish agreed to abide by this express trust either upon incorporation in 1927 or upon recognition as a parish in spiritual union with the diocese in 1947. In agreeing to abide by all &quot;canonical or legal enactments,&quot; it was unlikely that the parties intended that the parish could have reserved a veto over every future change in the canons. Moreover, it was significant that the parish never objected to the applicability or tried to remove itself from the reach of the canons in the more than 20 years since the national church adopted the express trust provision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant local Episcopal parish held its real and personal property in trust for the benefit of plaintiff Diocese and nonparty Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America (National Church), such that upon defendant's separation from the Diocese its property reverted back to the Diocese or the National Church. Application of the neutral principles doctrine to church property disputes requires a court to focus on the language of the deeds, the terms of the local church charter, the state statutes governing the holding of church property, and the provisions in the constitution of the general church concerning the ownership and control of church property, and to determine whether those documents indicate that the parties intended to create a trust or restriction. Here, nothing in the deeds established an express trust, defendant's certificate of incorporation did not indicate that the church property was to be held in trust, and there was no provision of the Religious Corporations Law that conclusively established a trust in favor of either the Diocese or the National Church. However, under the Dennis Canons, adopted in 1979 by the General Convention of the National Church, a parish holds its property in trust for the Diocese and the National Church, and defendant agreed to abide by the express trust established by the Dennis Canons either upon incorporation or upon recognition as a parish in spiritual union with the Diocese. Although the Dennis Canons were adopted nearly 30 years after defendant became a parish, defendant had agreed to abide by all &quot;canonical and legal enactments,&quot; and it was unlikely that the parties intended that defendant could reserve a veto over every future change in the canons.

The owners argued that the lower court erred in failing to apply the discretionary factors to excuse joinder of necessary parties. The appellate court disagreed. When a necessary party was subject to the jurisdiction of the court, CPLR 1001(b) directed that the court order him summoned. It did not provide for consideration of the discretionary factors. A statute of limitations did not deprive a court of jurisdiction nor even a litigant of a substantive right, but was merely a defense which may have, if properly asserted, deprived a plaintiff of any remedy from a defendant.

Inasmuch as a statute of limitations does not deprive a court of jurisdiction, the county and school district were subject to the court's jurisdiction. Since the county and school district established their right to dismissal of the amended petition against them due to the expiration of the limitations period, the case against the assessor was properly dismissed due to petitioners' failure to join them as necessary parties (CPLR 1003). </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed an order by the Appellate Division (New York) that affirmed the denial of his CPLR art. 78 petition to review a determination by respondent State Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) that administratively added five years of post-release supervision (PRS) onto his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Neither during the inmate's plea allocution nor at sentencing did the trial court inform him that a mandatory five-year PRS term would be imposed. That term was also not recorded on the sentencing commitment order. The inmate alleged that he first learned of his PRS sentence when the DOCS presented him with a conditional release agreement. He signed the agreement &quot;under protest&quot; and was released. Because of his drug use and failure to participate in drug treatment, the inmate's PRS was revoked. The court of appeals found that because CPL 380.20 and 380.40 collectively provided that only a judge could impose a PRS sentence, the DOCS could not do so. Therefore, the inmate was entitled to relief pursuant to CPLR 7803(2), as the act was in excess of the DOCS's jurisdiction, the inmate was clearly entitled to the relief sought, and he had no other remedy at law or equity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed, the petition was granted, and the DOCS was prohibited from imposing upon the inmate a period of post-release supervision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and Prisoners -- Calculation of Sentence -- Postrelease Supervision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner was entitled to a writ of prohibition barring the Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) from adding a mandatory period of postrelease supervision (PRS) onto his sentence even though that PRS term was never pronounced by the sentencing judge. Pursuant to CPL 380.20 and 380.40, only the sentencing judge is authorized to pronounce the PRS component of a defendant's sentence. By imposing that term upon petitioner, DOCS was acting in a judicial capacity and in excess of its jurisdiction. Issuance of the writ of prohibition was not barred by precedential considerations, since PRS represents a significant punishment component that restricts an individual's liberty, and a defendant has a statutory right to have that punishment imposed by the sentencing judge. Moreover, petitioner also lacked another remedy at law or equity. A challenge to the PRS term in a CPL 440.20 proceeding would necessarily fail, as the statute only permits challenges to judicially imposed sentences. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In related appeals, five defendants sought review of Appellate Division (New York) decisions, which affirmed the trial courts' judgments. Defendants claimed that they were entitled to be relieved of their statutory obligation to serve a term of post-release supervision (PRS) because the trial courts failed to pronounce their PRS terms in accordance with CPL 380.20 and 380.40.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were separated into two broad groups: those whose PRS sentences were imposed pursuant to plea bargains and those whose PRS sentences were imposed following jury trials. Defendants were all first and second violent felony offenders, and a period of PRS was required under Penal Law &sect;&sect; 70.00(6) and/or 70.45(1) or (2)(f). However, the trial courts did not mention the PRS term when pronouncing sentence; the PRS terms only appeared on documents such as clerk-prepared commitment sheets. On appeal, the court modified the orders in all cases by remitting for resentencing. Defendants were not entitled to expungement of any PRS obligation from their sentences because &sect;&sect; 70.00(6) and 70.45(1) contained mandatory PRS requirements, notwithstanding the fact that the trial courts failed to comply with CPL 380.20 and 380.40 in not making an oral pronouncement of the PRS term during sentencing. A clerk-prepared commitment sheet did not constitute a proper sentencing pronouncement as sentencing was a uniquely judicial responsibility. Because the error was a procedural error, the sole remedy was to vacate the sentence and remit for a resentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified all five appellate division orders by remitting to the trial courts for resentencing and the proper judicial pronouncement of the relevant PRS term.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes  Sentence -- Postrelease Supervision -- Failure of Court to Pronounce Term of Postrelease Supervision -- Remittal for Resentencing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants, whether they pleaded guilty or were sentenced following jury trial, were not entitled to be relieved of their statutory obligation to serve a term of postrelease supervision (PRS) (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 70.00 [6]; &sect; 70.45 [1]) even though the sentencing courts failed to pronounce defendants' PRS terms as required by CPL 380.20 and 380.40. A court clerk's notation of the PRS term on a worksheet or a commitment sheet did not satisfy the statutory mandate, and judicial endorsement of the clerk's actions, through any method other than pronouncement in the defendant's presence, could not cure the sentencing courts' PRS errors. Expungement of any PRS obligation from defendants' sentences, whether the PRS term was to be set at the court's discretion or was mandatory, was not warranted as it would require the sanctioning of a sentence not contemplated by statute. At the time of each defendant's sentencing, Supreme Court clearly intended to impose a sentence in compliance with the provisions of Penal Law &sect; 70.00 (6) and &sect; 70.45 (1)--one that consisted of a determinate sentence and a period of PRS. The failure to pronounce the required sentence amounted only to a procedural error, and remittal for resentencing was the appropriate remedy.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Postrelease Supervision -- Failure of Court to Pronounce Term of Postrelease Supervision -- Remedy of Expungement Not Warranted </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendants' argument that expungement of any term of postrelease supervision (PRS) from their sentences was the only proper remedy for the sentencing courts' failure to pronounce defendants' PRS terms as required by CPL 380.20 and 380.40, because the People failed to seek proper resentencing within one year from the date of their convictions and did not properly preserve their objection to defendants' expungement remedy before the trial court (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 440.40 [1]), was rejected. Defendants could move &quot;[a]t any time&quot; for resentencing (CPL 440.20 [1]); their failure to exercise that right did not entitle them to the remedy requested here. Further, a court's authority to correct its own errors at resentencing is not subject to the one-year time limit imposed on the People by CPL 440.40 (1).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Court of Appeals -- Failure of Sentencing Court to Pronounce Term of Postrelease Supervision -- Remittal for Resentencing </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Where defendants claimed that expungement of any term of postrelease supervision (PRS) from their sentences was the only proper remedy for the sentencing courts' failure to pronounce defendants' PRS terms as required by CPL 380.20 and 380.40, the Court of Appeals was not precluded by CPL 450.90 from remitting for resentencing following the appellate courts' affirmance of defendants' convictions and sentences. Defendants' contention that the People, having prevailed below, were not entitled to that affirmative relief from the Court of Appeals, was rejected. Rather than affirmative relief to the People, the Court of Appeals was merely giving a more limited form of relief to defendants than they sought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Court of Appeals -- Failure of Sentencing Court to Pronounce Term of Postrelease Supervision -- Remittal for Resentencing </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Upon determining that defendants' sentencing proceedings were procedurally flawed due to the sentencing courts' failure to pronounce defendants' terms of postrelease supervision, the Court of Appeals was not barred by CPL 470.35 (1) from considering whether resentencing was the appropriate remedy. When considering an Appellate Division order that affirms Supreme Court's sentence, the Court of Appeals may determine &quot;any question of law involving alleged error or defect in the criminal court proceedings resulting in the original ... sentence ... regardless of whether such question was raised, considered or determined upon the appeal to the intermediate appellate court&quot; (CPL 470.35 [1]). Because the original sentences here clearly &quot;result[ed]&quot; from the flawed sentencing proceedings, modification and remittal for resentencing was warranted. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was indicted for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third and fifth degrees, sought review of a an Appellate Division (New York) decision, which reversed the trial court's decision to grant defendant's motion to suppress drugs taken from his body pursuant to a manual body cavity search and to dismiss the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police observed defendant and another individual involved in what appeared to be a drug transaction. Defendant's clothing was searched at the police station, but no drugs were found. Defendant was asked to remove his clothing and then ordered to bend over or squat. The police observed a string or piece of plastic hanging out of defendant's rectum. When defendant refused to remove the object, the police pulled on the string and removed a plastic bag that was found to contain crack cocaine. On appeal, the court reversed. Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and based on the difference in the degree of intrusiveness between visual and manual body cavity searches, a visual body cavity search could be justified by a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee was concealing a weapon or contraband. However, probable cause and a search warrant were required prior to a manual body cavity search unless an emergency situation existed. While probable cause existed in the instant case, no exigent circumstances, such as the imminent destruction of the drugs, were established; thus, a search warrant was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate division's order, granted defendant's motion to suppress to the extent of suppressing the drugs recovered, and dismissed the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant, who had been observed engaging in a hand-to-hand sale of two small quantities of crack cocaine, was properly subjected to a warrantless visual body cavity inspection. In order to conduct a warrantless visual body cavity search, during which a police officer looks at but does not touch the arrestee's anal or genital cavities, usually by asking the arrestee to bend over, the police must have a specific, articulable factual basis supporting a reasonable suspicion to believe the arrestee secreted contraband, evidence, or a weapon inside a body cavity, and the visual inspection must be conducted reasonably. Here the police had reasonable suspicion that defendant had drugs secreted underneath his clothing and possibly in his body, and the inspection, which was conducted privately in a cell, without undue force and by officers of the same gender as defendant, was reasonable in scope and manner and did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Manual Body Cavity Search </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The police, having physically removed the object that was attached to a string protruding from defendant's rectum without first obtaining a warrant, conducted an unreasonable manual body cavity search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Although defendant, who had been observed engaging in a hand-to-hand sale of two small quantities of crack cocaine, was properly subjected to a warrantless visual body cavity inspection, a more stringent standard applied to the physical search of his body cavity. Once the police saw the string, their reasonable suspicion was elevated to probable cause to believe that contraband was concealed in defendant's body, but probable cause alone was not enough to permit the removal of the object. Rather, the police were required to obtain a warrant authorizing the removal in the absence of exigent circumstances justifying an immediate seizure. There were no exigent circum stances here, as the testifying officers indicated that the purpose of the search was to secure evidence and there was no testimony that the drugs were in imminent danger of being destroyed, disseminated, or lost, or that defendant was in medical distress. </SPAN></P>

Although defendant admitted to one prior conviction, he challenged his identification with the second prior conviction and claimed that the trial court improperly made a finding of fact, that of his identity, in violation of Apprendi.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the dismissal of both of the inmate's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 actions against respondents, employees of the state Department of Correctional Services (DOCS), on the basis that the actions were barred by Correction Law &sect; 24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two actions arose as the result of disciplinary proceedings that the inmate was subjected to for, inter alia, assaulting a correction officer and an incident in which the inmate was allegedly grabbed from behind without justification by one correction officer and sustained a minor injury to his finger. On the prior appeal, the appellate division had affirmed the dismissal because &sect; 24 did not violate the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. The court agreed, finding that the Supremacy Clause permitted states to deny enforcement of a federal right in a case where a state court lacked jurisdiction due to a neutral state rule regarding the courts' administration. The state rule in Correction Law &sect; 24 was neutral and valid because the same claim against a DOCS employee, whether arising under federal law, such as 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, or state law, would be barred. The fact that a plaintiff could sue the State directly in the state court of claims did not alter the court's analysis. The court noted that states could be sued by individuals only in state courts unless sovereign immunity was waived or abrogated under U.S. Const. amend. XI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate division's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Supremacy Clause -- Preclusion of Civil Actions in State Courts against Department of Correctional Services Personnel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction Law &sect; 24, pursuant to which New York courts lack jurisdiction under state or federal law to entertain civil actions seeking money damages against officers or employees of the Department of Correctional Services (DOCS), does not violate the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution (US Const art VI [2]), despite the fact that state courts cannot adjudicate federal 42 USC &sect; 1983 causes of action against DOCS officers or employees. Although conduct by persons acting under color of state law which is wrongful under 42 USC &sect; 1983 cannot be immunized by state law, the Supremacy Clause imposes no constitutional impediment to the operation of Correction Law &sect; 24. The Supremacy Clause gives states the power to deny enforcement of a federal right if they have a valid excuse for doing so, and one permissible exception is when a state court lacks jurisdiction due to a neutral state rule regarding the administration of the courts. Section 24 does not discriminate against section 1983 actions solely because the suit is brought under a federal law--it applies with equal force to all state and federal claims based on the identity of the defendant and the alleged conduct at issue. Because Correction Law &sect; 24 does not treat section 1983 claims differently than it treats related state law causes of action, the Supremacy Clause is not offended. The fact that a plaintiff can sue the state directly in the Court of Claims does not alter this analysis. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant co-owner of a vehicle appealed an order of the Appellate Division (New York) (intermediate court), which denied a City's CPLR art. 78 petition, and reversed a trial court's decision upholding a decision of the New York City Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings that ordered that a vehicle be released to the co-owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vehicle was impounded when respondent owner was arrested for a drug sale. The state's highest court held that an innocent co-owner might be entitled to release of an impounded vehicle if the co-owner could show that she: (i) was a registered and/or titled co-owner; (ii) was not a participant or accomplice in the offense and did not permit or suffer the vehicle to be used as a means of committing a crime or employed in aid or furtherance of crime under Administrative Code of the City of NY &sect; 14-140(b), (e)(1); and that (iii) continued deprivation would substantially interfere with her ability to obtain critical life necessities. The City established a prima facie case for impoundment. However, the co-owner failed to meet her burden to show that she was an innocent co-owner who would suffer a substantial hardship due to continued impoundment as she failed to show that she depended on the vehicle as an essential form of transportation critical to life necessities. The co-owner used the vehicle &quot;every so often, maybe once a week.&quot; The City's interest in deterrence of future criminal conduct involving the vehicle outweighed the co-owner's present possessory interest.</SPAN></P>

Although the City has the burden at the hearing of establishing its right to continued impoundment by a preponderance of the evidence, it is not required to prove that the co-owner of a seized vehicle is not an &quot;innocent owner.&quot; Rather, the innocent co-owner has the burden of proving that his or her present possessory interest outweighs the City's need to impound the vehicle to deter future criminal conduct, and to safeguard its right to future auction proceeds by preventing theft, sale, destruction or loss. An innocent co-owner may be entitled to release of the vehicle upon demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she is a registered and/or titled co-owner; was not a &quot;participant or accomplice&quot; in the underlying offense and did not &quot;permit[]&quot; or &quot;suffer[]&quot; the vehicle to be &quot;used as a means of com mitting crime or employed in aid or furtherance of crime&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 14-140 [b], [e] [1]); and that continued deprivation would substantially interfere with his or her ability to obtain critical life necessities, such as earning a livelihood, obtaining an education or receiving necessary medical care.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a robbery of a fast-food restaurant, defendant and a coworker shot seven employees, killing five. Prior to jury selection, defendant had made a motion, which was denied, for an order declaring the deadlock jury instruction under CPL 400.27(10)&nbsp;unconstitutional and non-severable. The jury returned a death sentence on three first-degree murder counts. Based on the subsequent holding in People v. Lavalle, the court found that the CPL 400.27(10) deadlock jury instruction was unconstitutional as it violated defendant's due process rights and right to a fair trial and vacated defendant's death sentence. However, the court could not craft a new instruction because to do so would usurp the legislative prerogative. The Lavalle precedent had to be followed as it had not led to an unworkable holding because it allowed death penalty cases to go forward as only noncapital first degree murder prosecutions until a sentencing statute was enacted that properly informed the jury of the consequences of their actions. The court had a duty to invalidate the sentencing statute as the jury instruction provision was inextricably interwoven with the sentencing procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant inhaled from an aerosol cleaning product and, 45 seconds later, veered into oncoming traffic and into another vehicle. A passenger in the other vehicle was killed and others were injured. Based on the language, history, and scheme of &sect; 1192(3), the court concluded that the legislature intended to use &quot;intoxication&quot; to refer to a disordered state of mind caused by alcohol, not by drugs. The court held that the legislative history, not only manifested legislative intent to employ the term &quot;intoxicated&quot; to refer to persons inebriated by alcohol and to prevent them from driving, but also revealed a scheme by which &sect; 1192(3) would reach that goal. The court held that including driving while under the influence of limitless &quot;drugs&quot; as a violation of driving while intoxicated was not part of that mechanism. The court held that, if &sect; 1192(3) was read to allow for any drug to be included as part of the definition of &quot;intoxication,&quot; then a person who committed a misdemeanor under &sect; 1192(3) could not, in contravention of the legislative plan, have been found to have committed the lesser-included offense of driving while impaired by alcohol under &sect; 1192(1).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A driver cannot be prosecuted under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 (3) for &quot;driving while intoxicated&quot; while under the influence of drugs. Inasmuch as it was the intent of the Legislature that Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 (3) was to apply only to intoxication caused by alcohol, evidence that defendant inhaled a hydrocarbon while driving, veered into oncoming traffic and crashed into a vehicle, killing one of its passengers, could not support charges of operating a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated condition (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 [3]) or vehicular manslaughter in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 125.12). The enactment in 1966 of what is now Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 (4) prohibiting driving while ability impaired by drugs indicated that section 1192 (3) did not proscribe such conduct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order by the Appellate Division (New York) that unanimously affirmed a judgment of conviction and an order denying his CPL 440.10 motion to vacate; defendant claimed that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to file a CPL 30.10 motion to dismiss the indictment on statute of limitations grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While in prison on unrelated charges, defendant produced a blood sample pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 995 for inclusion in the DNA data bank. In 2003, the sample linked him to a sexual assault, involving two victims, that had occurred in 1993. Subsequently, defendant pleaded guilty to rape and sodomy charges. The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that defendant's plea of guilty operated as a waiver of his claimed statutory right to dismissal of the indictment under CPL 30.10. In light of the trial court's indication that it would deny the CPL 30.10 motion, it was understandable that defense counsel would not make the motion. It was not a case where the alleged ineffectiveness of counsel went to the voluntariness of defendant's plea and waiver of appeal. Defendant was aware of the potential statute of limitations defense and the possible application of the CPL 30.10(4)(a)(ii) tolling provision. After having an opportunity to weigh his options, defendant chose not to assert the defense, declined his right to a jury trial, and waived his right to raise the limitations argument on appeal.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant waived the defense of the statute of limitations (CPL 30.10) when he entered his guilty plea. Although a guilty plea does not extinguish every claim on appeal, only a limited number of claims survive a valid waiver: jurisdictional matters or rights of a constitutional dimension that go to the very heart of the process. The statute of limitations under CPL 30.10 is neither a jurisdictional matter nor a right of constitutional dimension that survives a guilty plea. The right to assert the defense can be waived, and defendant did so by pleading guilty.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant, who waived the defense of the statute of limitations (CPL 30.10) when he entered his guilty plea, could not avoid the consequences of the plea by claiming on appeal that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to file a motion to dismiss the indictment on statute of limitations grounds. Under the circumstances, were defendant's statute of limitations claim to be considered on the merits, the very argument that defendant waived when he pleaded guilty and waived his right to appeal would be reviewed. In any event, because Supreme Court indicated that it would deny defendant's CPL 30.10 motion, it was understandable that defense counsel would not make the motion. Moreover, this was not a case where the alleged ineffectiveness of counsel went to the voluntariness of defendant's plea and waiver of appeal. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of five counts of attempted dissemination of indecent material to minors in the first degree (former Penal Law &sect; 235.22). He appealed. The New York Appellate Division reversed his conviction and dismissed the indictment on grounds that his communications could not have &quot;depicted&quot; sexual conduct within the meaning of &sect; 235.22(1) because they included no visual, sexual images. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, 42, communicated by Internet with a police officer posing as a 14-year-old boy. They exchanged a photos of themselves, fully clothed; the officer sent photos of an adolescent boy. In the text of his instant messages, defendant described sexual acts he enjoyed. He also described various imagined sexual encounters they might have, involving oral and anal sex. He did not, however, send any pornographic images or other pictorial representations of nudity or sex. The two made plans to meet; defendant described sexual acts in which they might engage. He was arrested when he went to meet the &quot;boy.&quot; The high court held that the legislature, in enacting former &sect; 235.22, intended to criminalize the activities of adults who engaged minors in sexually infused communication. Therefore, &sect; 235.22 criminalized the activities of adults who used words, rather than images, to lure minors. Section &sect; 235.22 was not void for vagueness if the word &quot;depict&quot; was interpreted to include textual descriptions, since &sect; 235.22's language conveyed a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the intermediate appellate court was reversed and the case was remitted to that court for consideration of the facts and issues raised but not determined on the appeal to that court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was properly convicted of attempted dissemination of indecent material to minors in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 110.00, former &sect; 235.22) even though his communications contained no nude or sexual images. Defendant's Internet communications with an undercover police officer whom he believed to be a minor &quot;depict[ed]&quot; sexual conduct within the meaning of former Penal Law &sect; 235.22 (1). The ordinary meaning of the word &quot;depict&quot; is represent in a picture or represent or portray in words. The Legislature did not intend to limit the scope of former Penal Law &sect; 235.22 to sexual predators who use images, rather than words, to lure minors. Rather, the Legislature intended to criminalize the activities of adults who engage minors in sexually infused communication. The statute has been correctly construed to criminalize the use of any &quot;sexually explicit communications,&quot; and is not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent grandmother, under Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72 and Family Ct Act &sect; 651, sought reasonable visitation with her grandchild. Appellant father opposed her request and sought an order barring her contact with the child. The trial court granted judgment to the grandmother, and ordered visitation. The Appellate Division (New York) affirmed, modifying certain terms of the visitation schedule, and the father sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the child's mother's cancer diagnosis, the grandmother moved into the child's home to care for him, continuing after the mother died, until the father asked her to leave. The court of appeals held she had standing to seek visitation under Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72(1), due to the mother's death. Findings that the grandmother's visitation with the child was in his best interest were supported. The trial court considered the father's right to rear the child but found the grandmother had a close relationship with the child and respected her and the father's separate roles in the child's life, and that no credible evidence supported his claim that she sought to usurp his parental role. When the Appellate Division affirmed these findings, the court of appeals could not revisit them. It was strongly presumed that the father's wishes were in the child's best interests, under &sect; 72(1), but the grandmother rebutted this presumption, and the child's best interests were properly considered. Section 72(1) was not unconstitutional facially or as applied as it was interpreted to defer to a parent's wishes, and it was presumed that the father's wishes were in the child's best interests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Section 72 (1) of the Domestic Relations Law was properly applied in granting petitioner grandmother visitation with her grandchild. Petitioner had automatic standing to seek visitation under section 72 (1) based upon the death of the child's mother, and record evidence supported the determination of the courts below that visitation between petitioner and the child was in the child's best interest. Supreme Court was properly mindful of respondent father's right to rear the child as he saw fit, but determined that the grandmother had established an extraordinarily close relationship with the child during the nearly five-year period that she had lived with him and respondent, and that the relationship with the grandmother was central to the child's well-being. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72 (1), which provides a procedural mechanism for grandparents to acquire standing to seek visitation with a minor grandchild, was not rendered facially unconstitutional by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Troxel v Granville</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (530 US 57, 120 S Ct 2054, 147 L Ed 2d 49 [2000]). The statute at issue in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Troxel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> permitted any person to petition for visitation rights and authorized the trial court to grant such rights in the best interest of the child. The Supreme Court held that application of the statute violated the mother's due process right to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control of her children. Section 72 (1) accords deference to a parent's decisions. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72 (1) was constitutionally applied to award petitioner grandmother reasonable visitation with her grandchild. Although the trial court, mindful of respondent father's parental prerogatives, employed the strong presumption that the father's wishes represented the child's best interests, as required by the statute, the grandmother surmounted the presumption. For over three years following the death of the child's mother, the grandmother was the child's surrogate, live-in mother. Following consideration of the circumstances bearing upon whether it was in the child's best interest for his relationship with the grandmother to continue--e.g., the reasonableness of the father's objections to the grandmother's access to the child, her caregiving skills and attitude toward the father, the law guardian's assessment, the child's wishes--the court granted visitation. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A municipal ordinance designed to address aggressive panhandling by prohibiting the solicitation of any occupant of a motor vehicle that is on a street or other public place is not unconstitutionally overbroad. Content-neutral regulations of time, place and manner of expression are enforceable if they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and leave open ample alternative channels of communication. The governmental interests served by the ordinance--to eliminate a source of distraction for motorists and thus promote the free and safe flow of traffic--are significant. Further, the ordinance is not a blanket ban and leaves open ample alternative avenues to communicate any message of indigency or need through begging. Because the ordinance focuses on specific conduct that the municipality has an interest in controlling in order to further a significant content-neutral government interest, it is narrowly tailored. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoners appealed an order by the Appellate Division (New York) that, inter alia, reversed the trial court's order for conditional release from involuntary commitment to respondent psychiatric center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoners were nearing the end of their sentences for various felony sex offenses when they were examined by two physicians for the purpose of involuntary commitment. The physicians certified that each prisoner suffered from a mental illness and that, without inpatient psychiatric treatment, each posed a high risk of re-committing sexual crimes if released into the community. The prison superintendents completed applications for involuntary commitment on medical certification, pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 9.27. As the prisoners' prison terms expired, they were each transported to the psychiatric center, where each was further examined by a third physician who also found involuntary commitment necessary. The Court of Appeals found, inter alia, that because the prisoners were still inmates at the time the applications for involuntary commitment were initiated, they were subject to the provisions of Correction Law &sect; 402 rather than Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 9.27.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Incapacitated and Mentally Disabled Persons -- Involuntary Commitment -- Involuntary Transfer of Convicted Sex Offenders to State Psychiatric Facility at Conclusion of Prison Terms </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of a clear legislative directive in regard to inmates nearing their release from incarceration, Correction Law &sect; 402 is the appropriate method for evaluating an inmate for postrelease involuntary commitment to a mental facility. Once the sentence expires, however, any further proceedings concerning the continued need for hospitalization are governed by the Mental Hygiene Law. Section 402 prescribes precommitment procedural requirements, including court supervision, pretransfer notice and an opportunity to be heard within a reasonable period of time prior to the inmate's proposed release date. By providing that Correction Law &sect; 402 applies to inmates &quot;undergoing a sentence of imprisonment,&quot; the Legislature intended those procedures to be used to evaluate for commitment all imprisoned persons, regardless of when an inmate is scheduled to be released. Accordingly, the procedures set forth in Correction Law &sect; 402, rather than Mental Hygiene Law article 9, should have been utilized in involuntarily committing certain sex offenders who, though nearing the end of their prison sentences, were still in the custody of the Department of Correctional Services when all the preliminary paperwork and examinations relating to commitment were completed. Moreover, prison superintendents are proper persons to execute the applications for involuntary commitment. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff organizations sued the State, seeking a declaration its public school financing system was unconstitutional. After remand from the State's high court, the trial court confirmed the recommendations of referees. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) reversed and directed the Governor and the Legislature to appropriate additional operating and capital funds.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organizations claimed New York City public school students were not receiving a sound basic education as guaranteed by the N.Y.

The high court ordered the State to ascertain the cost of providing such education and to ensure a system of accountability to measure the effectiveness of its reforms. The intermediate appellate court held that the trial court erred by relying on the referees' report. The high court agreed; the trial court should have determined whether the State's estimate of the costs was reasonable, and whether the State plan incorporated that expenditure in its proposed budget and would, if enacted, ensure a system of accountability. Instead, the trial court appointed referees to recommend which competing compliance proposal to adopt. As the Governor's proposed reform plan was not unreasonable or irrational, it was entitled to judicial deference. But the intermediate appellate court erred in ordering the State to appropriate more operating funds than the State's estimate required, and its order requiring a capital improvement plan was unnecessary in view of subsequent legislation appropriating funds for such improvements.</SPAN></P>

The State, not Supreme Court, was ordered by the Court of Appeals to ascertain the cost of a sound basic education in New York City.

The Governor's proposed State Education Reform Plan reasonably concluded that additional annual operating funds in the amount of $ 1.93 billion, appropriately adjusted with reference to the latest version of the Geographic Cost of Education Index and inflation since 2004, would ensure children in New York City's public schools the opportunity for a sound basic education, as required by the Education Article of the New York Constitution (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Campaign for Fiscal Equity v State of New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 100 NY2d 893, 801 NE2d 326, 769 NYS2d 106 [2003]). Judicial deference to the Legislature's financing plan was justified by the Judiciary's limited access to the controlling economic and social facts and by respect for the doctrine of separation of powers. The use of a cost-effectiveness filter was rationally defensible, and the conclusion that New York City could attain minimal constitutional standards while spending less than the higher-spending group of successful school districts was not irrational.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner nursing homes filed a proceeding under CPLR art. 78 against respondents, the Commissioner of Health of the State of New York, and others, to challenge the amount of Medicaid reimbursement that they received during 2004, claiming in part that the rates violated the mandate in Public Health Law &sect; 2807(3). The Appellate Division (New York) affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the proceeding and the nursing homes appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nursing homes contended that the Medicaid reimbursement they received from the State was not close to the actual costs expended for the care of Medicaid-eligible residents. The nursing homes challenged the rate setting methods used by the New York State Department of Health (DOH). The trial court dismissed the nursing homes' petition and the dismissal was affirmed by the appellate division. Affirming, the court held that the DOH acted within the scope of their statutory authority conferred under Public Health Law &sect; 2807-c(10) when they used the CPI as the trend factor for rate setting. The court noted that the DOH was directed to update the base year from 1983, but the update would be phased in over two years in the future. Based on the statutory guidelines, the court concluded that the Commissioner acted rationally in setting the 2004 Medicaid reimbursement rates. The DOH had advanced ample explanation for setting the rates prospectively based on the 1983 costs, as adjusted and trended forward. The rate-setting methodology used by the DOH did not result in an unconstitutional taking because the nursing homes had voluntarily agreed to participate in the price-regulated program.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent Commissioner of Health acted rationally in setting 2004 Medicaid reimbursement rates for petitioner nursing homes. Pursuant to article 28 of the Public Health Law, the Department of Health (DOH) establishes Medicaid reimbursement rates for nursing homes using the Resource Utilization Group-II (RUG-II) case mix reimbursement methodology (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see generally</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10 NYCRR subpart 86-2), a cost containment device that encourages facilities to economize. A nursing home's reimbursement rate reflects its allowable costs in a base year, 1983, as adjusted to reflect patient conditions and care needs and regional differences in wages and fringe benefits, and trended forward to account for inflation. Within the parameters set by the Legislature, DOH has advanced ample explanation for setting rates prospectively based on 1983 costs, as adjusted in various ways and trended forward.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent Commissioner of Health acted rationally in setting 2004 Medicaid reimbursement rates for petitioner nursing homes. Despite the fact that petitioners' Medicaid reimbursement rates covered only about 76% of their actual 2002 Medicaid costs, the reimbursement rates were reasonable and adequate as required by Public Health Law &sect; 2807 (3). Section 2807 (3) does not require rates to cover every nursing home's actual costs. Rates are &quot;reasonable and adequate&quot; so long as they reimburse the necessary costs (i.e., &quot;costs which must be incurred&quot;) of &quot;efficiently and economically operated facilities&quot; (EEOFs). The Department of Health (DOH) used the findings from its study of EEOFs to confirm that its overall rates complied with Public Health Law &sect; 2807 (3), and thus had a rational basis for concluding that its 2004 reimbursement rates were reasonable and adequate. DOH's rate-setting methodology took each of the statutory factors in section 2807 (3) into account, and the Commissioner was entitled to great deference in her determination that the rates were reasonable under the statute.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In setting Medicaid reimbursement rates for petitioner nursing homes, the Department of Health did not violate the Takings Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution. While petitioners contended that New York effectively required them to provide care to the indigent and then failed to reimburse them for their actual costs, thus forcing them to use their own assets to meet this public responsibility, where a service provider voluntarily participates in a price-regulated program or activity, there is no legal compulsion to provide service and thus there can be no taking.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In setting Medicaid reimbursement rates for petitioners, nursing homes operating in western New York, the Department of Health (DOH) did not violate the Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, &sect; 11 of the New York Constitution. While petitioners claimed that DOH's rate-setting methodology favored nursing homes in the New York City area, they failed to show any intentional action by DOH to discriminate against facilities in western New York. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff faith-based social service organizations challenged the validity of legislation requiring health insurance policies that provided coverage for prescription drugs to include coverage for contraception. The Appellate Division (New York) affirmed a Supreme Court decision rejecting the organizations' challenge, granting summary judgment dismissing the complaint, and declaring the legislation valid. The organizations appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue were provisions of the Women's Health and Wellness Act (WHWA) requiring that an employer health insurance contract which provided coverage for prescription drugs include coverage for the cost of contraceptive drugs or devices (Insurance Law &sect; 3221(1)(16), &sect; 4303(cc)). The organizations argued that the provisions requiring coverage of contraception violated the Free Exercise Clauses of the New York and U.S. Constitutions, and the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The appeals court found that by the Smith test, the First Amendment had not been offended. Religious beliefs were not the target of the WHWA, and it was not that law's object to interfere with the organizations' exercise of religion. In interpreting N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, the court found that the burden the WHWA placed on the organizations' religious practices was a serious one, but it did not literally compel them to purchase contraceptive coverage for their employees, in violation of their religious beliefs; it only required that policies that provided prescription drug coverage include coverage for contraceptives. The organizations were not required to purchase prescription drug coverage at all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Women's Health and Wellness Act (WHWA) (L 2002, ch 554), which requires that an employer health insurance contract that provides coverage for prescription drugs include coverage for the cost of contraceptives, does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to the extent that its exemption from contraceptive coverage for &quot;religious employers&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Insurance Law &sect; 3221 [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">l</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] [16] [A]; &sect; 4303 [cc] [1]) does not extend to plaintiffs, faith-based social service organizations. The burden on plaintiffs' religious exercise is the incidental result of a neutral law of general applicability. Religious beliefs were not the &quot;target&quot; of the WHWA, and it was not that law's &quot;object&quot; to interfere with plaintiffs' or anyone's exercise of religion. The object of the WHWA was to make broader health insurance coverage available to women, to improve women's health and to eliminate disparities between men and women in the cost of health care.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Religion -- Mandated Insurance Coverage for Contraceptives -- &quot;Religious Employer&quot; Exception -- Free Exercise -- Hybrid Rights Exception </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Women's Health and Wellness Act (WHWA) (L 2002, ch 554), which requires that an employer health insurance contract that provides coverage for prescription drugs include coverage for the cost of contraceptives, does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to the extent that its exemption from contraceptive coverage for &quot;religious employers&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Insurance Law &sect; 3221[</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">l</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] [16] [A]; &sect; 4303 [cc] [1]) does not extend to plaintiffs, faith-based social service organizations. The &quot;hybrid rights&quot; exception, pursuant to which the First Amendment has been held to bar application of a neutral, generally applicable law to religiously motivated action where there is a challenge to free exercise in conjunction with other constitutional protections, was inapplicable here. Plaintiffs' claim that the challenged legislation interfered with their rights of free speech and association was insubstantial. The legislation does not interfere with plaintiffs' right to communicate, or to refrain from communicating, any message they like; nor does it compel them to associate, or prohibit them from associating, with anyone. While it does burden plaintiffs' exercise of religion, that alone does not call the validity of a generally applicable and neutral statute into question.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Religion -- Mandated Insurance Coverage for Contraceptives -- &quot;Religious Employer&quot; Exception -- Free Exercise -- Doctrine of Church Autonomy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Women's Health and Wellness Act (WHWA) (L 2002, ch 554), which requires that an employer health insurance contract that provides coverage for prescription drugs include coverage for the cost of contraceptives, does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to the extent that its exemption from contraceptive coverage for &quot;religious employers&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Insurance Law &sect; 3221 [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">l</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] [16] [A]; &sect; 4303 [cc] [1]) does not extend to plaintiffs, faith-based social service organizations. The right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability which, as here, does not target religious beliefs as such. The doctrine of church autonomy, which prevents states from interfering in matters of internal church governance or determining ecclesiastical questions, was not applicable here since church autonomy was not at issue. The Legislature has not attempted through the WHWA to lend its power to one or the other side in controversies over authority or dogma. The WHWA merely regulates one aspect of the relationships between plaintiffs and their employees.  </SPAN></P>

The Women's Health and Wellness Act (WHWA) (L 2002, ch 554), which requires that an employer health insurance contract that provides coverage for prescription drugs include coverage for the cost of contraceptives, does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to the extent that its exemption from contraceptive coverage for &quot;religious employers&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Insurance Law &sect; 3221[</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">l</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] [16] [A]; &sect; 4303 [cc] [1]) does not extend to plaintiffs, faith-based social service organizations. The right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability which, as here, does not target religious beliefs as such. The &quot;ministerial exception,&quot; which exempts religious institutions from complying with title VII of the Civil Rights Act with respect to their ministers, was inapplicable. The existence of a limited exemption for ministers from antidiscrimination laws does not translate into an absolute right for a religiously-affiliated employer to structure all aspects of its relationship with its employees in conformity with church teachings.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Religion -- Mandated Insurance Coverage for Contraceptives -- &quot;Religious Employer&quot; Exception -- State Free Exercise Clause </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Women's Health and Wellness Act (WHWA) (L 2002, ch 554), which requires that an employer health insurance contract that provides coverage for prescription drugs include coverage for the cost of contraceptives, does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the New York Constitution (art I, &sect; 3) to the extent that its exemption from contraceptive coverage for &quot;religious employers&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Insurance Law &sect; 3221[</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">l</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] [16] [A]; &sect; 4303 [cc] [1]) does not extend to plaintiffs, faith-based social service organizations. Where the State has not set out to burden religious exercise, but seeks only to advance, in a neutral way, a legitimate object of legislation, the New York Free Exercise Clause does not require the State to demonstrate a &quot;compelling&quot; interest in response to every claim by a religious believer to an exemption from the law. The WHWA does not literally compel plaintiffs to purchase contraceptive coverage for their employees, in violation of their religious beliefs. Moreover, when, as here, a religious organization chooses to hire employees who do not share its religious beliefs, it must, to some degree, be prepared to accept neutral regulations imposed to protect those employees' legitimate interests in doing what their own beliefs permit. Finally, in view of the State's substantial interest in fostering equality between the sexes and in providing women with better health care, the legislation at issue did not constitute an unreasonable interference with plaintiffs' exercise of their religion.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Establishment of Religion -- Mandated Insurance Coverage for Contraceptives -- &quot;Religious Employer&quot; Exception </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The Women's Health and Wellness Act (WHWA) (L 2002, ch 554), which requires that an employer health insurance contract that provides coverage for prescription drugs include coverage for the cost of contraceptives, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to the extent that its exemption from contraceptive coverage for &quot;religious employers&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Insurance Law &sect; 3221 [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">l</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] [16] [A]; &sect; 4303 [cc] [1]) does not extend to plaintiffs, faith-based social service organizations. Although in another case the Establishment Clause was violated by a statute designed to exempt from certain regulatory requirements all religious faiths except a disfavored one, here the WHWA was not designed to favor or disfavor any particular religion. Legislative accommodation to religious believers is a long-standing practice consistent with First Amendment principles. A legislative decision not to extend an accommodation to all kinds of religious organizations does not violate the Establishment Clause. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff same-sex couples sued defendants, city license-issuing authorities, the New York Department of Health, and New York State, seeking a declaration that restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples violated the New York Constitution. The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court reversed a trial court decision granting the couples summary judgment and affirmed a decision granting defendants summary judgment. The couples appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The couples claimed that by limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples, New York statutory law violated the New York Constitution's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses (N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6 and 11, respectively). The high court disagreed. As the parties acknowledged, N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law arts. 2 and 3 clearly limited marriage to opposite-sex couples. As to the due process challenge, the legislature could have rationally decided (1) that, for the welfare of children, it was more important to promote stability, and that same-sex relationships were more unstable than opposite-sex ones; and (2) that it was better for children to grow up with both a mother and a father. Even assuming, as the couples asserted, that there was no conclusive scientific evidence to support the latter contention, the legislature could rationally proceed on the common-sense premise that children did best with a mother and father in the home. As to the equal protection challenge, the restriction of marriage to opposite-sex couples was subject only to rational basis scrutiny, and the definition of marriage to exclude same-sex couples was not irrationally underinclusive or overinclusive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Marriage -- Same Sex Marriage -- Constitutionality of Marriage Laws </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's Domestic Relations Law limits marriage to opposite-sex couples, and this limitation is valid under the due process and equal protection provisions of the New York Constitution. Although the right to marry is a fundamental right, deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition, the right to marry someone of the same sex is not such a fundamental right. By defining marriage as it has, the New York Legislature has not restricted the exercise of a fundamental right. Where no fundamental right is at issue, legislation is valid under the Due Process Clause if it is rationally related to legitimate government interests. Since there is a rational relationship between the government's interest in protecting the welfare of children and the limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples, that limitation does not deprive same sex couples of due process of law. Further, under the applicable rational basis scrutiny, the restriction of marriage to opposite-sex couples does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Permitting marriage by all opposite-sex couples does not create an irrationally overnarrow or overbroad classification. Whether same sex marriages should be recognized is a question for the Legislature. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was born in Guyana. Appellant executed an affidavit declaring he was &quot;convinced&quot; he was the child's father and accepting all paternal responsibilities, including child support. He signed a Guyana registry, stating that he was her father and authorizing the change of her last name to his. The family court found that appellant held himself out as the child's father and behaved in every way as if he was, and that the child justifiably relied on his representations, accepting him as her father and treating him as such. The high court noted that it was bound by these findings, as they were supported by the record. Under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 418(a), appellant was estopped from denying paternity because the child justifiably relied on his representation of paternity, to her detriment. Appellant's fraud defense failed, as the child was the party in whose favor estoppel was being applied and there could be no claim she was guilty of fraud. Moreover, there was every reason to believe that the mother also thought appellant was the biological father. That appellant renounced his paternity and terminated his relationship with the child did not preclude the application of estoppel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent, who represented himself as the father of a child born out of wedlock, was equitably estopped from denying paternity even though a blood genetic marker test later confirmed that he was not the child's biological father, and was required to pay child support, since the child justifiably relied on respondent's representation of paternity by forming a bond with him, to the child's detriment. Based upon established precedents, the affirmed findings of fact herein and the legislative recognition of paternity by estoppel, it was in the best interests of the child to equitably estop respondent from denying paternity. Pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 418 (a), Family Court may deny biological paternity testing based on &quot;res judicata, equitable estoppel or the presumption of legitimacy of a child born to a married woman,&quot; if denial is in the best interests of the child. Although the child's biological paternity had been addressed before Family Court conducted its trial on the issue of estoppel, Family Court was authorized to decide the estoppel issue. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the Appellate Division (New York) that affirmed a trial court judgment that convicted him, after a nonjury trial, of reckless endangerment in the first degree pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 120.25. The trial court found that defendant's state of mind was not one of depraved indifference when he attempted suicide by sealing his apartment and turning on the gas, resulting in an explosion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant survived the explosion and no one else was injured, but neighboring apartments were damaged. The trial court found that defendant did not act out of a lack of regard for the lives of others but because of his depression and his focus upon himself. The appellate court reversed the intermediate appellate court's order, holding that depraved indifference to human life was a culpable mental state. Because the depraved indifference language was identical in &sect; 120.25 and in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.25(2) pertaining to depraved indifference murder, the court analyzed caselaw pertaining to depraved indifference murder. It determined that People v. Register, 60 N.Y.2d 270 (1983), and People v. Sanchez, 98 N.Y.2d 373 (2002), which held that depraved indifference included no mens rea element beyond mere recklessness, were no longer to be followed. Although a factfinder could reasonably have inferred from defendant's actions that he had the requisite mental state, he could not be found to be depravedly indifferent when the trial court explicitly found that he was not. His conviction was therefore reduced to reckless endangerment in the second degree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court modified the trial court order by reducing defendant's conviction to reckless endangerment in the second degree and remitting the case to the trial court for resentencing.

Section 120.25 provides that a person violates the statute &quot;when, under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person.&quot; Depraved indifference to human life, which is best understood as an utter disregard for the value of human life, is a culpable mental state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People appealed the judgment of the Appellate Division (New York) which affirmed the dismissal of six counts charging defendant judge with receiving reward for official misconduct in the second degree, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 200.25. The issue was whether evidence that a judge violated the Rules Governing Judicial Conduct, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 22, part 100, was legally sufficient to support six counts under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 200.25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People presented evidence to a grand jury that defendant engaged in a course of conduct where on numerous occasions he violated his duty as a public servant for which he received benefits of cash and other gratuities. The People presented evidence that defendant and an attorney developed a relationship wherein the attorney gave defendant gifts expecting and receiving preferential treatment in return. The Court of Appeals held that it was reasonable for the grand jury to find that defendant violated his explicit duty not to initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications concerning a pending proceeding as prohibited by N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 22, &sect; 100.3(B)(6). The evidence supported an inference that defendant, in referring potential clients to the client, lent the prestige of his judicial office for the sake of advancing private interests. The evidence was legally sufficient, in accordance with N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 70.10, and supported every element of counts one through six of the indictment charging defendant with violating his duties as a public servant and then accepting benefits in exchange for those violations in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 200.25.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower appellate court was modified to reinstate the six counts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence that a judge accepted a benefit for violation of his duty as a public servant, as defined by the Rules of Judicial Conduct (22 NYCRR part 100 [Rules]), was legally sufficient to support six counts of receiving reward for official misconduct in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 200.25). The Rules set forth a constitutionally mandated duty upon the judiciary and, when combined with the additional factor of receiving a reward, a violation of that duty may serve as a basis for prosecution under Penal Law &sect; 200.25. Here, the People set forth evidence that defendant, a Justice of the Supreme Court, engaged in substantive ex parte conversations with an attorney appearing in a case pending before him, in violation of the rule that prohibits a judge from engaging in unauthorized ex parte communications (22 NYCRR 100.3 [B] [6]). There was also evidence before the grand jury that defendant accepted &quot;referral fees&quot; from a lawyer in violation of the rule that prohibits a judge from lending &quot;the prestige of judicial office to advance the private interests of the judge or others&quot; (22 NYCRR 100.2 [C]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People made voluntary disclosures to defendant, but failed to mention a pretrial identification and served no N.Y.

Defendant's conviction of attempted burglary was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) (intermediate court). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that a police officer was improperly allowed to testify to his identifications of defendant as no &sect; 710.30(1)(b) notice was given. The state's highest court refused to extend the confirmatory identification exception from Wharton to situations where a police officer's initial encounter with a suspect and subsequent identification of that suspect were temporally related, such that the two might be considered part of a single police procedure. To do so would run afoul of &sect; 710.30 and would eliminate the protections offered by a Wade hearing even when the initial police viewing was fleeting, unreliable, and susceptible of misidentification. The officer viewed defendant at night, while defendant stopped for a few seconds on a fire escape, some 40-to-50 feet above the ground. This was in stark contrast to the face-to-face viewing in Wharton. Moreover, the officer was not placed on the scene specifically to make an identification and was not focused on identifying the suspect to a backup team. Whether the identification resulted from any impropriety was the very determination requiring a Wade hearing. The People were required to serve a &sect; 710.30(1)(b) notice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;confirmatory identification&quot; exception to the notice and hearing requirements of CPL 710.30 should not be extended to situations where a police officer's initial encounter with a suspect and subsequent identification of that suspect are temporally related, such that the two might be considered part of a single police procedure. Such an exception would eliminate the protections offered by a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Wade</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing even when the initial police viewing--albeit part of a single police procedure--was fleeting, unreliable and susceptible of misidentification. Here, it could not be concluded that the circumstances of the officer's initial viewing--at night, while defendant stopped for a few seconds on a fire escape some 40 to 50 feet above the ground--were such that, as a matter of law, the subsequent identification could not have been the product of undue suggestiveness. Thus, the officer's out-of-court and in-court identifications should have been precluded due to the lack of CPL 710.30 notice. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York) entered an order that agreed with the trial court that a disposal tax included in a state law discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution; however, it also found that the remedy was to eliminate in-state exemptions on cleanup and process wastes from the disposal tax. Plaintiff taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court and the appellate division held, and the State did not contest, that the State Superfund's disposal tax, a part of the statutory financing scheme for the cleanup of inactive hazardous waste disposal sites in New York State, unlawfully discriminated against interstate commerce and, thus, violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The taxpayer, in appealing to the instant court, asserted that the appellate division's remedy to address that constitutional infirmity of eliminating in-state exemptions on cleanup and process wastes from the disposal tax altogether was improper. Rather, the taxpayer asserted that the disposal tax should be severed from those special assessments. The instant court agreed. It found that the problem was how to cure the constitutional infirmity while remaining true to the legislature's intent. It then concluded that striking N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 27-0923(2)'s disposal tax in its entirety was the option that best furthered the multiple legislative purposes of the special assessments and declared that the disposal tax was so stricken.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Commerce Clause -- Special Assessments on Disposal of Hazardous Wastes </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The disposal tax imposed by the State's Hazardous Waste Remedial Fund (ECL 27-0923 [2]) as part of the statutory financing scheme for the cleanup of inactive hazardous waste disposal sites in New York State unlawfully discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution and was stricken in its entirety pursuant to the applicable severability clause (L 1985, ch 38, &sect; 19). ECL 27-0923 (2) (d) was facially discriminatory in violation of the Commerce Clause insofar as it exempted from taxation the disposal of hazardous waste generated in New York State which had been taxed pursuant to ECL 27-0923 (1), without exempting from taxation the disposal of hazardous waste generated in another state which had been taxed pursuant to any other state's similar generation tax. The best available option to cure the constitutional infirmity was to sever the disposal tax from the special assessments imposed upon the generation and disposal of hazardous waste. Such an approach preserved the generator tax as a revenue stream and did not significantly curtail revenues for funding hazardous waste cleanups. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

A state has great flexibility in responding to a determination that it has levied an impermissibly discriminatory tax, and Supreme Court was not mandated to consider plaintiff's request for a refund in plaintiff's declaratory judgment action.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a nonjury trial, the trial court found that defendant had continuously operated approximately 50 bus engines for several hours, which engine noise was audible beyond the real property where it originated and thereby disturbed a complainant. On appeal, the conviction was reversed. The appellate term held that Islip, N.Y., Code &sect; 35-3(D) was an anti-noise ordinance that was designed to prevent noises constituting a public nuisance and a wrong against the community, rather than involving an individual concern. Accordingly, the appellate term found that the information was defective because it did not allege that there was a public nuisance from the noise. On further review, the court noted that the appellate term's decision was based on an unpreserved error, and as such, it was deemed to have been rendered in the interest of justice under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 470.15. The information was sufficient to assert a charge against defendant based on the clear language of the town ordinance. Further, the constitutionality of the ordinance was not raised. Accordingly, pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An intermediate appellate court's reversal of a conviction on the basis of an unpreserved error, and therefore as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, is not appealable to the Court of Appeals. Accordingly, because the validity of an ordinance prohibiting unreasonable engine noise was not challenged before the trial court, the issue of whether an anti-noise statute requires an element of public nuisance, as concluded by the Appellate Term in reversing defendant's conviction under the ordinance, was unpreserved for review by the Court of Appeals (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 470.05 [2]). Although a claim that an accusatory instrument is facially insufficient presents a jurisdictional question exempt from the requirement of preservation, that was not the error alleged in this case, where the information contained allegations sufficient to establish, if true, every element of the offense as defined in the ordinance. Inasmuch as a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute must be preserved, the Court of Appeals will not consider a constitutional claim in the guise of an argument that the accusatory instrument was facially insufficient.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city council challenged a decision from the Supreme Court, Appellate Division (New York), which dismissed a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding filed against respondents, a mayor and a city, to compel enforcement of the New York City Equal Benefits Law, New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 6-126.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Equal Benefits Law prohibited the city from entering into contracts with any person that failed to provide its employees' domestic partners with equal benefits. The mayor refused to enforce the law, and the city council filed a proceeding to compel enforcement. The supreme court granted the petition, but the appellate division concluded that the law was preempted by state and federal law. The council then sought review. In affirming the appellate division, the reviewing court determined that it was permitted to rule on the validity of the Equal Benefits Law because it was raised as a defense in the case. Next, the Equal Benefits Law was preempted by N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 103(1) because it was plainly in tension with the requirement that the city give contracts to the lowest bidder. Under N.Y. Const. art. 9, &sect; 2c(ii) and N.Y. Gen. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 10(1)(ii), the city was not allowed to adopt laws of this nature where the legislature restricted such. The Equal Benefits Law was also preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1001 et seq., because it prescribed the terms of benefit plans. Finally, the market participant exception did not apply.</SPAN></P>

In a CPLR article 78 proceeding against the Mayor of the City of New York and the City of New York seeking a judgment requiring them to implement and enforce New York City's Equal Benefits Law (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 6-126), the Mayor was entitled to raise the invalidity of the Equal Benefits Law as a defense, notwithstanding that an article 78 proceeding does not lie to challenge a legislative act. A petitioner who is challenging the validity of legislation may not use an article 78 proceeding for that purpose. However, an officer against whom an article 78 proceeding for a writ of mandamus is brought may defend on the ground that the legislation he or she has been asked to enforce is invalid. </SPAN></P>

Under section 103, contracts for public work over $ 20,000 and purchase contracts over $ 10,000 are to be awarded &quot;to the lowest responsible bidder.&quot; The Equal Benefits Law violates this requirement by excluding from public contracting any &quot;responsible bidder&quot; that does not provide equal benefits to domestic partners and spouses. Further, the grant of power to municipalities to legislate concerning certain subjects, including some that affect persons employed by any contractor or subcontractor performing work, labor or services for the municipality (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [c] [ii] [9]; Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 [1] [ii] [a] [10]), is expressly made subject to contrary state legislation such as General Municipal Law &sect; 103. </SPAN></P>

ERISA governs employee benefit plans and their fiduciaries (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;29 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 [b]), and supersedes state laws insofar as they relate to any employee benefit plan of the kind governed by ERISA (29 U.S.C. &sect; 1144 [a]). The Equal Benefits Law seemingly seeks to do exactly what ERISA prohibits--to prescribe the terms of benefit plans. Moreover, the market participant exception to federal preemption, which has been recognized where the State acts as a market participant with no interest in setting policy, is inapplicable to the Equal Benefits Law because, in enacting the law, the Council of the City of New York was setting policy.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, granted plaintiff adult use business owners leave to appeal its decision granting cross-motions by defendants, a city and its officials, in the owners' declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of the definition of &quot;adult use&quot; in New York City, N.Y., Zoning Reg. &sect; 12.10, as amended in 2001, and certified a question as to the correctness of its ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning ordinance as enacted in 1995 allowed some latitude to mixed-use businesses, and was applied less restrictively to business owners who devoted less than 40 percent of their floor space to adult activities. The ordinance had been upheld as not violative of the First Amendment or N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Convinced that the 60/40 formula was resulting in sham compliance, the city amended the ordinance in 2001, to broaden its definition of adult establishment use. The owners challenged the amended ordinance, arguing that they had expended considerable time and money to comply with the 1995 ordinance, only to find themselves potentially in violation of the amended law. The court noted that it generally deferred to legislative determinations where based on recognized studies linking adult uses and neighborhood deterioration, but held that in response to the city's showing, the owners had nonetheless raised triable issues as to whether their compliance was in fact a sham. Therefore, summary judgment should not have been granted to the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order for the most part, but modified it to deny the grant of summary judgment in favor of the city and its officials. It remitted the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Zoning Amendments Restricting Adult Establishments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A question of fact was presented as to whether New York City's adult use zoning regulations, as amended in 2001 to limit superficial compliance unanticipated when the 1995 Ordinance regulating adult businesses was initially enacted, served a public purpose other than censorship and therefore did not infringe upon plaintiffs' rights of free speech under the federal and state constitutions. Because the reasonable discretion accorded most local legislative actions extends to adult use zoning, in enacting the 2001 amendments, the City was entitled to rely principally on the same evidence of negative secondary effects that supported the original ordinance. The City was not required, however, to relitigate the secondary effects of adult uses, or to produce empirical studies connecting businesses with the required 60/40 allocation to adverse secondary effects. There was a triable question of fact as to whether 60/40 businesses were so transformed in character that they no longer resembled the kinds of adult uses found to create negative secondary effects or whether these businesses' technical compliance with the 60/40 formula was merely a sham.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the affirmation by the Appellate Division (New York) of his conviction for robbery. The issue was whether defendant, who claimed that he believed in good faith that the property was his, was entitled to a &quot;claim-of-right&quot; jury instruction in a prosecution for robbery of a compact disc player.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two acquaintances approached the victim, and defendant snatched a compact disc player out of the victim's hand. Defendant walked away and allegedly began listening to a CD in the disc player. One of defendant's acquaintances then told the victim to give him his money and then repeatedly punched the victim. Defendant testified that shortly before taking the disc player from the victim, he had borrowed a friend's compact disc player which was stolen from him by a group of six or seven members of a gang. According to defendant, he first approached the victim because the victim was holding a disc player and resembled one of the individuals who had taken the disc player from him. Defendant's requested to charge the jury on the &quot;claim-of-right&quot; defense under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 155.15(1) was denied. The appellate court held the trial court properly refused to charge the jury on the &quot;claim of right&quot; defense since such a defense was only available in a larceny prosecution, not in a robbery prosecution, as public policy considerations militated against encouraging the use of forcible self-help to recover property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the prosecution of defendant for robbery of a compact disc player, defendant was not entitled to a &quot;claim-of-right&quot; jury instruction even though he in good faith believed that the disc player was his. The Legislature has limited the availability of the statutory claim-of-right defense to prosecutions for larceny by trespass or embezzlement (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 155.15 [1]), and public policy considerations militate against encouraging the use of forcible self-help to recover property. Although a good-faith but mistaken claim of right might defeat a robbery prosecution, and a defendant is free to make that argument to the jury, that defendant is not entitled to such an instruction by the court, which would aid the defendant by underscoring one aspect of the proof, or lack of proof. </SPAN></P>

The organization omitted the landowner from the suit. The city moved to dismiss the petition because the organization had failed to name a necessary party within the statute of limitations period. However, the trial court permitted the organization to amend its petition to add the landowner as a defendant. The intermediate appellate court found that the organization's failure to adequately explain why it did not include the landowner as a defendant in a timely manner precluded it under N.Y.

The Court of Appeals of New York found that the landowner was a necessary party, and should have been joined in the proceeding at its inception.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Limitation of Actions -- Defendants United in Interest </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding to review a determination granting respondent landowner's application for a use variance, Supreme Court erred in treating the landowner as united in interest with respondent City when it denied the City's motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that petitioner had failed to name a necessary party, the landowner, within the statute of limitations period. The landowner was a necessary party and should have been joined in the proceeding at its inception. Further, the interest of the landowner and the City in maintaining the status of the variance did not create a unity of interest such that an action against the landowner related back to the filing date of the petition. The status of the landowner's property represented a potential loss of millions of dollars, while the City was necessarily concerned with regulatory and administrative consequences. Such divergent long-term interests could not be guaranteed to protect the landowner from future prejudice in the case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Necessary Parties </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Appellate Division erred in dismissing a proceeding to review a determination granting respondent landowner's application for a use variance, based on the fact that petitioner had offered no adequate explanation for its failure to name the landowner, a necessary party, as a respondent prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations, where the trial court, having granted petitioner's motion to amend the petition and join the landowner, did not address the discretionary factors in CPLR 1001 (b). When, as here, a necessary party can be joined only by consent or appearance, a court has discretion to determine whether to allow the action to proceed and must consider the five factors enumerated in CPLR 1001 (b). One of those factors--&quot;whether and by whom prejudice might have been avoided&quot; (CPLR 1001 [b] [3])--includes inquiry into why a litigant failed to name a necessary party prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations. While an unexplained expired statute of limitations is very strong indication that an action should be dismissed, it is a factor in, not preclusion of, the requisite analysis. The Appellate Division gave no indication that it had considered all of the CPLR 1001 (b) factors, and it is not for the Court of Appeals in the first instance to weigh the factors. Accordingly, the matter was remitted to the trial court for further proceedings.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err by rejecting appellant's challenge to a second juror based on her answers of &quot;I think I can&quot; and that she would &quot;try&quot; when responding to questions about her ability to put her opinion aside because her other answers dispelled any doubt about her ability to deliberate impartially. The trial court did not err by rejecting appellant's request to instruct the jurors to disregard his postmortem conduct when determining whether he committed first-degree &quot;similar fashion&quot; murder because the court determined that there was no reason to hold that similarity had to be shown by the killing act alone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the prosecution of defendant for capital murder, the evidence offered by the People at the suppression hearing demonstrated prima facie that it was more probable than not that defendant murdered the three women whose deaths were being investigated and thus there was probable cause for his arrest. One of the victims was last seen alive in defendant's company, two of the victims were both killed by being severely beaten about the face and head and were disposed of as trash, minus hands or limbs, suggesting a common killer, and the trace evidence associated with the bodies of two of the victims was also present in the security booth where defendant worked. Defendant did not work as scheduled on the day that one victim's body was discovered, or on the day that another victim was last seen alive. Moreover, defendant was known to entertain prostitutes, including one of the victims, in his room, and another prostitute had seen a work bench or table with tools, including a hacksaw and a hammer, on a porch adjacent to his room. Several prostitutes reported that defendant always had baking soda on hand in his room, and the bodies of two of the victims were sprinkled with a white powdery substance.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a capital murder prosecution, the trial court did not err by rejecting defendant's for cause challenge under CPL 270.20 (1) (b) to a prospective juror who acknowledged during voir dire that he had read a newspaper article about jury selection in the case even though the prospective jurors had been instructed, when they filled out written questionnaires two months earlier, not to read media accounts of the case. The juror's forthright acknowledgment that he had read the article displayed not a wanton disregard of a court order, but rather an honest misunderstanding of what the trial court had instructed, as he incorrectly believed that only articles detailing the underlying facts of the crimes charged were off limits.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Selection of Jury -- Capital Murder Trial -- Juror Related to Prosecutor </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a capital murder prosecution, the trial court did not err by rejecting defendant's for cause challenge under CPL 270.20 (1) (c) to a prospective juror whose brother-in-law, a former prosecutor with the District Attorney's Office, had attended a single meeting regarding the investigation of defendant. The meeting occurred prior to defendant's arrest, and the juror's brother-in-law never made any court appearances in defendant's case, having resigned from the office and moved to Nevada shortly after defendant's arrest and months before the start of jury selection. CPL 270.20 (1) (c), which provides a for cause challenge when a prospective juror &quot;is related within the sixth degree by consanguinity or affinity to&quot; certain enumerated persons, including &quot;counsel for the people,&quot; does not encompass the tangential relationship presented here.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial -- Capital Murder Trial -- Midtrial Publicity -- Midtrial Voir Dire </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In a capital murder prosecution, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining defendant's request to survey the jury regarding a newspaper headline that appeared following the testimony of the People's forensic serologist and read &quot;Link to 2 More Victims.&quot; Trial courts are afforded wide flexibility in determining what, if any, steps are required to assure a defendant's right to a fair trial in light of the particular midtrial publicity and circumstances encountered, subject to appellate review for an abuse of discretion. Here, the trial court correctly described the headline as &quot;somewhat neutral,&quot; and found that inquiring about the headline would inevitably focus the jurors' attention on something that there was no indication any of them had seen, and that might well foster infelicitous speculation, especially as the trial court had not asked the jurors about any of the many past headlines or news accounts relating to the trial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Capital Murder -- Multiple Murders Committed in Similar Fashion -- Postmortem Conduct </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In the capital murder prosecution of defendant for beating three women to death, cutting off their hands or limbs, and then disposing of the bodies and hands or limbs as garbage, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict defendant of first-degree murder for intentionally causing the death of the three women in &quot;separate criminal transactions ... committed in a similar fashion&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1] [a] [xi]). In all three murders, defendant brought the women to the room where he lived and killed them by repeatedly beating them about the face and head with a heavy, blunt object, using enough force to split their skulls open. Afterward, defendant hacked off the victim's hands or limbs, disposed of the bodies in garbage receptacles, and separately disposed of their severed hands or limbs in order to inhibit identification of the victims, one of whom remained unidentified at trial. The trial court did not err by refusing to instruct the jurors to disregard defendant's postmortem conduct in dismembering and discarding the bodies when determining whether he committed first-degree &quot;similar fashion&quot; murder. Similarity need not be shown by the killing act alone, and postmortem conduct may well be relevant. What counts is the similarity of the conduct, not whether it occurred before or after the victim's death.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee political candidate filed a N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 16-102 proceeding to invalidate independent petitions nominating appellant rival candidate of the Senior Citizens Party for the same office the political candidate was seeking.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The political candidate asserted that the independent nominating petitions were invalid because several pages of signatures were obtained by a subscribing witness who was not a resident of the political district, and who had struck some of the language in the Statement of Witness that appeared at the bottom of the preprinted petition sheets. The signature pages included a witness statement containing language prescribed in N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 6-140(1)(b). The subscribing witness struck a phrase that appeared in the witness statement, which read &quot;and I am also duly qualified to sign the petition,&quot; by drawing a line through these words, substituting the word &quot;OMIT&quot; and initialing the change. No explanation for the alteration was included on the petitions. The court found that the subscribing witness, a New York resident, could not be disqualified by &sect; 6-140(1)(b) from circulating the independent nominating petitions by virtue of his residency outside the district. However, due to the lack of explanation for the alteration of the witness statement, the political candidates's application to invalidate the rival candidate's nominating petition was properly granted.</SPAN></P>

Although the Election Law &sect; 6-140 (1) (b) requirement that a subscribing witness to a nominating petition be a resident of the same political subdivision as the office sought by the candidate supported by the nominating petition is unconstitutional, during the proceeding to invalidate the petitions there was no proof offered that the witness had struck the language for that reason and not because he was disqualified for some other reason.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendants participated in a political demonstration staged at the height of the morning rush hour, they were found guilty of second-degree obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct. In order to comply with the trial court's instruction to supply it with updated criminal histories or &quot;rap sheets&quot; in support of the prosecution's sentencing recommendations, the People moved ex parte pursuant, inter alia, to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 160.50(1)(d)(ii) to unseal defendants' docket or arrest records. The People thereafter informed the court of more than 20 prior acts of civil disobedience undertaken by defendants, based principally on allegations taken from complaints in the unsealed cases. The appellate court held that the &quot;law enforcement agency&quot; exception in &sect; 160.50(1)(d)(ii) was not broad enough to encompass the prosecutor's ex parte request to unseal records for purposes of making sentencing recommendations.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A CPLR article 78 proceeding was not the proper procedural vehicle to preclude the People from using information obtained from sealed records of prior criminal proceedings involving petitioners in a pending Criminal Court sentencing. Petitioners did not challenge a public official's ministerial acts or actions taken in excess of authority. Petitioners could have properly sought judicial review of the unsealing of their records by timely civil appeal, but the initial unsealing orders were not the proper appealable papers because they were obtained by ex parte application. In order to create an appealable paper, a motion on notice to vacate was needed, and petitioners promptly made such a motion. Accordingly, the CPLR article 78 proceeding was converted into the proper form, which was a civil appeal (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 103 [c]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Records -- Sealing of Records upon Termination of Criminal Action in Favor of Accused -- Unsealing of Records for Purposes of Making Sentencing Recommendations Not Authorized</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. CPL 160.50 (1) (d) (ii), which provides that records sealed upon termination of a criminal action in favor of the accused may be made available to a law enforcement agency, does not authorize a superior court to make such records available to a prosecutor for purposes of making sentencing recommendations in a subsequent criminal action involving the accused. The six statutory exceptions to the general proscription against releasing sealed records contained in CPL 160.50 (1) (d) are precisely drawn, underscoring the Legislature's commitment to prohibiting disclosure of sealed records except where the statute explicitly provides otherwise. The &quot;law enforcement agency&quot; exception in CPL 160.50 (1) (d) (ii) is not broad enough to encompass an ex parte request by a prosecutor to unseal records for purposes of making sentencing recommendations. The statute's provisions strongly suggest that its primary focus is the unsealing of records for investigatory purposes.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">2002 N.Y. Laws ch. 1 was enacted to allow New York's single, state-wide hospital-linked insurer to survive after it had been nearly bankrupted when transitions in health care insurance had made it the insurer of last resort.

The court held, first, that the subscribers, who were the primary plaintiffs, lacked standing to raise takings challenges because they did not have a property interest in continuing health coverage in exactly the manner they had received it before. Defendant board members were protected from liability by the business judgment rule as well as by statute. The insurer's certificate of incorporation was not a contract protected against impairment.

This supposed injury was flatly contradicted in the final determination of the Superintendent of Insurance approving defendant's conversion plan, and plaintiffs did not challenge that aspect of his determination. Even assuming injury in fact, plaintiffs did not link that purported injury (i.e., increased premiums and/or reduced benefits) to the wrong that they sought to redress--the Legislature's neglect to &quot;dedicat[e] . . .

In an action challenging the validity of chapter 1 of the Laws of 2002 (Chapter 1), which authorized the conversion of defendant health services corporation from a not-for-profit to a for-profit corporation and directed that certain of defendant's assets be used for public health and charitable purposes, plaintiffs, subscribers to defendant's health plans, had standing solely for purposes of protecting defendant's not-for-profit assets. Chapter 1 disabled both the Attorney General, the traditional guardian of the public interest and trusts beneficiaries, and defendant's Board of Directors, which had a duty of obedience to honor defendant's not-for-profit mission, from fulfilling their customary roles. These special interest factors justified relaxation of the usual rules of standing in this case where a charitable interest was involved (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Alco Gravure, Inc. v Knapp Found.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 64 NY2d 458, 479 N.E.2d 752, 490 N.Y.S.2d 116 [1985]).

Chapter 1 of the Laws of 2002 (Chapter 1), which authorized the conversion of defendant health services corporation from a not-for-profit to a for-profit corporation and directed that certain of defendant's assets be used for public health and charitable purposes, did not constitute an illegal taking of defendant's private property by effecting an exaction in violation of NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 7 and US Constitution Fifth Amendment. Exactions are land-use decisions conditioning approval of development on the dedication of property to public use. An exaction is an unconstitutional taking if the condition lacks an &quot;essential nexus&quot; with the state interest for which it is imposed, and is not &quot;roughly proportional&quot; to the impact of the proposed development. While plaintiffs contended that Chapter 1 imposed an exaction on defendant because conversion was conditioned upon defendant's dedication of its not-for-profit assets to legislatively articulated public and charitable purposes, the exaction analysis will not be extended beyond the realm of land-use regulation. In any event, Chapter 1 passed both the &quot;essential nexus&quot; and &quot;rough proportionality&quot; tests. </SPAN></P>

Chapter 1 of the Laws of 2002 (Chapter 1), which authorized the conversion of defendant health services corporation from a not-for-profit to a for-profit corporation and directed that certain of defendant's assets be used for public health and charitable purposes, did not constitute an illegal taking of defendant's private property by effecting a regulatory taking in violation of NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 7 and US Constitution Fifth Amendment. Governmental regulation of private property effects a taking if it is so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster. The compulsion normally present in takings claims was not present since Chapter 1 did not compel defendant to convert. Any duress stemmed from defendant's inability to prosper as a not-for-profit organization, not from pressure exerted by the State. In any event, Chapter 1 did not unduly interfere with defendant's legitimate property interests. The dedication of conversion assets to support public health programs and to recruit and retain health care workers was consistent with defendant's historic mission. Since defendant's Board of Directors determined that the most feasible way of continuing as a provider of health insurance in New York was through restructuring, it could not be said that Chapter 1's dedication of defendant's not-for-profit assets to public health purposes unduly interfered with defendant's legitimate property interests or &quot;investment-backed expectations.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Chapter 1 of the Laws of 2002 (Chapter 1), which authorized the conversion of defendant health services corporation from a not-for-profit to a for-profit corporation and directed that certain of defendant's assets be used for public health and charitable purposes, did not constitute an illegal taking of defendant's private property by effecting a per se taking in violation of NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 7 and US Constitution Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs' claim that the transfer of the stock sale's proceeds to the public asset fund would be a direct physical invasion of defendant's property was without merit. There can be no direct physical invasion where a corporation voluntarily elects to proceed under a statute allowing it to convert from a financially distressed not-for-profit to a new for-profit entity. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Chapter 1 of the Laws of 2002 (Chapter 1), which authorized the conversion of defendant health services corporation from a not-for-profit to a for-profit corporation and directed that certain of defendant's assets be used for public health and charitable purposes, did not deprive defendant of its property interests without due process of law, in violation of NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 6 and US Constitution Fifth Amendment. Although plaintiffs contended that Chapter 1's procedural safeguards did not encompass any input from the public, the Attorney General or Supreme Court into how defendant's not-for-profit assets were to be deployed, Chapter 1 provided defendant with process and plaintiffs with a remedy to grieve many of the determinations of the Superintendent of Insurance. Defendant had to choose to proceed with the conversion; public hearings were required; the Superintendent could only approve the conversion if he determined that it would not adversely affect defendant's subscribers or the delivery of health care benefits and services; and finally, if plaintiffs took issue with the Superintendent's approval of the plan, they had the right to challenge it in a CPLR article 78 proceeding. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Chapter 1 of the Laws of 2002 (Chapter 1), which authorized the conversion of defendant health services corporation from a not-for-profit to a for-profit corporation and directed that certain of defendant's assets be used for public health and charitable purposes, did not violate US Constitution, article I, &sect; 10, which barred the states from enacting legislation impairing the obligation of contracts, or NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 6, pursuant to which the State may not deprive a party to a contract of an essential contractual attribute without due process of law. Defendant's certificate of incorporation (COI) was not a contract. There was no indication that the Legislature, in enacting the Not-For-Profit Corporation Law, intended to make the COI a binding contract between not-for-profit corporations and the public. Chapter 1 did not impair the COI, nor did it change the COI. Actions by defendant and the Superintendent of Insurance changed the COI. Moreover, plaintiffs did not challenge the only &quot;impairment&quot; that resulted from Chapter 1, namely, defendant's conversion from not-for-profit to for-profit status. As a not-for-profit corporation, defendant was bound to carry out its not-for-profit purposes, but these purposes did not constitute a contract that Chapter 1 impaired. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Chapter 1 of the Laws of 2002 (Chapter 1), which authorized the conversion of defendant health services corporation from a not-for-profit to a for-profit corporation and directed that certain of defendant's assets be used for public health and charitable purposes, superseded all inconsistent common-law and statutory duties (Insurance Law &sect; 7317 [f] [ii]). Accordingly, plaintiffs' contentions that the conversion was required to follow the procedures in N-PCL 510 and 511, and that defendant's Board of Directors breached its fiduciary duty by deciding to convert, were rejected. In any event, the business judgment rule barred plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs' objection to action occurring before Chapter 1 was enacted was without merit because the plan of conversion was, in the Board's judgment, necessary to safeguard defendant's continued viability.  </SPAN></P>

Chapter 1 of the Laws of 2002 (Chapter 1), which authorized the conversion of defendant health services corporation from a not-for-profit to a for-profit corporation and directed that certain of defendant's assets be used for public health and charitable purposes, did not violate NY Constitution, article III, &sect; 17, which prohibits the Legislature from adopting a &quot;private or local bill&quot; &quot;[g]ranting to any corporation . . . any exclusive privilege, immunity or franchise whatever.&quot; For a bill to offend article III, &sect; 17, it must be directed at a single entity and it must confer a privilege upon the single entity to the exclusion of all others. Although Chapter 1 is a &quot;private or local bill&quot; because it applies only to defendant, Chapter 1 does not confer an exclusive privilege because it does not authorize defendant to prevent others from seeking to convert under similar parameters, or promise defendant that other not-for-profits will not be granted similar rights. Chapter 1 only grants defendant the right to operate as a for-profit insurer, a right that numerous other insurers currently enjoy in New York, and which others may receive upon application to the Superintendent of Insurance. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. Plaintiff's challenge to chapter 1 of the Laws of 2002 (Chapter 1), which authorized the conversion of defendant health services corporation from a not-for-profit to a for-profit corporation and directed that certain of defendant's assets be used for public health and charitable purposes, was rejected. The Legislature properly directed that defendant's not-for-profit assets be used for funding the recruitment and retention of health care workers. Defendant's mission is to promote affordable and accessible health care coverage. Fidelity to this purpose did not mandate creation of a charitable foundation devoted to health care funded by the entirety of defendant's not-for-profit assets, nor did it compel neglecting the needs of New York's hospitals. The hospitals and defendant have always played mutually supportive roles in New York's interrelated and complex health care delivery system. Specific programs to be funded with conversion proceeds benefit the uninsured or the underinsured. Chapter 1 designates a range of public health-related uses that fall comfortably within a reasonable interpretation of defendant's historic not-for-profit mission. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff media company sued defendants, the State and a county district attorney, seeking a declaratory judgment that N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 52 prohibited audio-visual coverage of most courtroom proceedings. The media company argued that the statute denied it the right of access to trials guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The instant court held that there was no First Amendment or N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, right to televise a trial. The instant court held that the media company possessed the same right of access as the public so that they could report what people in attendance had seen and heard. Thus, the press had no right to information about a trial superior to that of the general public. N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 52 did not prevent the press, including television journalists, from attending trials and reporting on the proceedings. What they could not do under the statute was bring cameras into the courtroom. This was not a restriction on the openness of court proceedings but rather on what means could be used in order to gather news. The media company's access was thus guaranteed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights Law &sect; 52, which bans audiovisual coverage of most courtroom proceedings, does not violate either United States Constitution First Amendment or New York Constitution, article I, &sect; 8. The First Amendment guarantees the press and the public a right of access to trial proceedings, but not the right to televise those proceedings. Although the public acquires information about trials chiefly through the press and electronic media, the press is not imbued with any special right of access. Civil Rights Law &sect; 52 does not prevent the press, including television journalists, from attending trials and reporting on the proceedings; it merely restricts the means that can be used in order to gather news. Nor is there any additional or broader protection under New York Constitution, article I, &sect; 8, than under the First Amendment insofar as access to court proceedings is concerned. Rather, the authority to decide whether or not to permit cameras in the courtroom has been constitutionally delegated to the Legislature.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant responded that, under the Treaty of Canandaigua of 1794 (7 Stat. 44), he had a federally-protected treaty right to fish in Wilson-Tuscarora State Park and that, because N.Y. Comp.

The Tuscarora Nation's fishing rights on the land in question were wholly contingent on continued ownership of the land by the Seneca. When the Seneca divested themselves of their interest in the land by the Treaty of Big Tree of 1797 (7 US Stat 601), the Tuscarora right to free use and enjoyment ended.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held the trial judge did not violate the Sixth Amendment by finding defendant was twice convicted of a felony.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Sentence -- Persistent Felony Offender </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discretionary persistent felony offender sentence enhancement provisions, set forth in Penal Law &sect; 70.10 and CPL 400.20 (5), are constitutional. Penal Law &sect; 70.10 (1) (a) defines a persistent felony offender as a person convicted of a felony who has two or more prior felony convictions. CPL 400.20 (5) provides that the sentencing court may review the history, character and criminality factors of such a person to determine whether to impose a recidivism sentence. Pursuant to this statutory framework, the prior felony convictions are the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">sole determinant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of whether a defendant is subject to recidivist sentencing as a persistent felony offender. A judge may find the fact of a defendant's prior conviction without violating the Sixth Amendment. Further, CPL 400.20, by authorizing a hearing on facts relating to the defendant's history and character, does not grant defendants a legal entitlement to have those facts receive controlling weight in influencing the court's opinion. A defendant adjudicated as a persistent felony offender has a statutory right to present evidence that might influence the court to exercise its discretion to hand down a sentence as if no recidivism finding existed, while the People retain the burden to show that the defendant deserves the higher sentence. Nevertheless, once a defendant is adjudged a persistent felony offender, a recidivism sentence cannot be held erroneous as a matter of law, unless the sentencing court acts arbitrarily or irrationally.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant occupied property that was zoned for residential-agricultural use. When the town learned that he intended to operate a commercial composting facility on the premises, it served him with a letter declaring that the proposed use violated various town ordinances. Defendant notified the town that he intended to initiate a commercial &quot;mulching&quot; operation, and he then purchased nearly $ 7,000 worth of tree bark. He was later convicted under the town's recycling ordinances of accumulating and storing municipal solid waste on his property as municipal solid waste was defined in the ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the town's definition of solid waste was not in any sense inconsistent with the Solid Waste Management Act, which used the definition from N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 27-0701. Further, it found that the State did not intend to preempt the field but had explicitly delegated to municipalities broad powers to manage their waste. The court found also that because the town's solid waste ordinance was not so vague as to permit or encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement in every case, defendant's facial vagueness challenge failed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Preemption by State -- Recycling Ordinance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was properly convicted of violating the recycling ordinance in Town of Concord Code &sect; 109-4 (A) and (B) for purchasing unused tree bark from a commercial lumber operation and storing it on his property for an extended period of time with the intent to resell it as mulch. These ordinances were not preempted by the Solid Waste Management Act, codified in various statutory sections, including Environmental Conservation Law article 27. The Solid Waste Management Act explicitly delegated to municipalities broad powers to manage their own waste problems so long as the local legislation complied with the minimum applicable requirements set forth in the legislation (ECL 27-0711). The act defined solid waste as all substances discarded or rejected as being spent, useless, worthless or in excess to the owners at the time of such discard or rejection, including but not limited to industrial and commercial waste (ECL 27-0701). Town of Concord Code &sect; 109-3 defined municipal solid waste as garbage, refuse and other discarded solid waste materials resulting from industrial, commercial and agricultural operations and from community activities. The Town's definition of solid waste was not inconsistent with the act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Recycling Ordinance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The recycling ordinance in Town of Concord Code &sect; 109-4 (A) and (B) and a related zoning ordinance in section 150-11 (A) are not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's prosecution for purchasing unused tree bark from a commercial lumber operation and storing it on his property for an extended period of time with the intent to resell it as mulch. Defendant was on actual notice that the Town considered the tree bark a municipal solid waste, and of the purported illegality of his mulching operation, even before it began. Similarly, defendant had actual notice that the Town considered his mulching operation an impermissible use of his property under the local zoning law as he was ticketed for the impermissible use, appealed the charge and sought a variance. Nor were the code provisions facially invalid since, in rejecting the as-applied challenge, it was necessarily concluded that there was at least one person, defendant, to whom the ordinances may be applied constitutionally. In addition, the local ordinance was not so vague as to permit or encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement in every case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Law of the Case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The trial court's denial of plaintiff Town's application for preliminary relief in a civil action seeking to enjoin defendant from operating a mulching facility due to alleged zoning violations did not have preclusive effect on the ongoing criminal prosecution. Mere denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction did not constitute the law of the case or an adjudication on the merits.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a group of taxpayers, legislators, and organizations, sued appellee Governor of the State of New York in the supreme court to challenge the constitutionality of 2001 N.Y. Laws ch. 383, pts. B, C, and D. The supreme court granted the Governor summary judgment and declared pts. B, C, and D constitutional. The New York Appellate Division declared pts. B and D constitutional but declared pt. C unconstitutional. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group argued that because N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 prohibited commercial gambling, subject to exceptions, the New York Legislature could not authorize the Governor to enter into tribal-state compacts (pt. B), nor could it allow video lottery terminals (pt. C) or permit the State of New York to participate in a multi-state lottery (pt. D). Further, the group argued that the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA), 25 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2701-2721; 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1166-1168, preempted the area. On appeal, the court found that 2001 N.Y. Laws ch. 383, pts. B, C, and D were constitutional. The group failed to meet their burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the invalidity of the legislation. As to the Indian gaming compacts, Class III gaming activity was not prohibited in New York, and although heavily regulated, it was permitted for charitable and other purposes. The IGRA's mandate allowed the State to play an important and essential role in regulating gambling on Indian lands. Finally, allowing video lottery terminals and participation in a multi-state lottery further promoted the State's public policy to increase funding for education via state-sponsored lotteries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the appellate court was modified by declaring all parts of the legislation constitutional, and, as so modified, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Casino Gaming on Indian Lands Pursuant to Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Legislation authorizing the Governor to enter into compacts with Indian tribes pursuant to the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA) (25 USC &sect;&sect; 2701-2721; 18 USC &sect;&sect; 1166-1168) allowing class III casino gaming on Indian lands within the state (L 2001, ch 383, part B) did not violate the commercial gambling prohibitions of NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 9. IGRA, which has preempted the field in the governance of gaming activities on Indian lands, permits type III gaming, the most highly regulated class of gaming, when &quot;located in a State that permits such gaming for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">any</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> purpose by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">any</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> person, organization, or entity&quot; (25 USC &sect; 2710 [d] [1] [B] [emphasis added]). Because New York permits some forms of class III gaming--for charitable purposes--such gaming may lawfully be conducted on Indian lands if authorized by a tribal ordinance and carried out pursuant to a tribal-state compact (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;25 USC &sect; 2710 [d] [1]). While IGRA does not require states to enter into a tribal-state compact with Indian tribes, it may be to the state's benefit to do so since, pursuant to IGRA, class III gaming will be permitted on Indian land with or without the state's involvement. Further, class III gaming is permitted on land held in trust for the benefit of an Indian tribe upon a determination that such gaming would not be detrimental to the surrounding community. It was not an improper delegation of legislative authority to authorize the Governor to execute tribal-state compacts with respect to such land. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Lotteries -- Video Lottery Gaming -- Operation of Video Lottery Terminals at Pari-Mutuel Racetracks </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Legislation authorizing the operation of video lottery terminals (VLTs) at certain pari-mutuel racetracks (L 2001, ch 383, part C; Tax Law &sect; 1617-a) was constitutional. The video lottery is a valid lottery under NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 9 (1), which expressly permits lotteries when operated by the State. A constitutional lottery requires the use of tickets and multiple participation, as opposed to a single player competing against a single machine, and the video lottery authorized by part C is consistent with this definition. It is of no constitutional significance that the tickets are electronic instead of paper. Rather than constitutionally forbidden slot machines, VLTs are simply mechanical devices for the implementation of the video lottery. Because it would have been rational for the Legislature to determine that certain racetrack communities were in greater need of the potential revenue that would be generated by the video lottery than others and, as a result, not require those areas to get prior local approval, there was no equal protection violation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Academic and Moot Questions -- Video Lottery Terminals at Pari-Mutuel Racetracks -- Revenue Distribution</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The issue of whether certain revenue distribution provisions of legislation authorizing the operation of video lottery terminals at particular pari-mutuel racetracks (L 2001, ch 383, part C; Tax Law &sect; 1617-a) were constitutional was not moot. The repeal of those revenue distribution provisions requiring reinvestment in breeding funds and for the enhancement of purses (L 2005, ch 61, part CC, &sect; 6) was prospective only. As a result an actual controversy remained as to the constitutional validity of the reinvestment provisions of part C of chapter 383 of the Laws of 2001 with respect to payments that had already been made under Tax Law &sect; 1612 (c) (1). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Lotteries -- Video Lottery Gaming -- Operation of Video Lottery Terminals at Pari-Mutuel Racetracks -- Revenue Distribution</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Revenue distribution provisions of legislation authorizing the operation of video lottery terminals at particular pari-mutuel racetracks (L 2001, ch 383, part C; Tax Law &sect; 1617-a) that required reinvestment in breeding funds and for the enhancement of purses were constitutional. The Constitution requires that the net proceeds from the sale of lottery tickets &quot;shall be applied exclusively to or in aid or support of education in the state as the legislature may prescribe&quot; (NY Const, art I, &sect; 9 [1]). &quot;Net proceeds&quot; means gross proceeds less any appropriate charges and expenses. Here, the Legislature prescribed that net proceeds consisted of all money remaining after the payment of administrative expenses, including the amount paid to the racetracks as a vendor fee, and the reinvested funds were a portion of the vendor fee. The Legislature's decision to regulate the racetracks in this way reflected a policy determination constitutionally within its purview.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Lotteries -- Validity of Multistate Lotteries</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Legislation authorizing the Division of the Lottery to operate and administer a multistate lottery in cooperation with a government-authorized group of one or more other jurisdictions (L 2001, ch 383, part D, &sect; 3; Tax Law &sect; 1617) permitted New York's participation in the multistate Mega Millions lottery since it fell within the constitutional exception to the prohibition on lotteries for lotteries &quot;operated by the state&quot; (NY Const, art I, &sect; 9 [1]). Although several jurisdictions were involved, New York retained sufficient control over the sale of Mega Millions tickets so that it operated the lottery within the state. Further, the net proceeds from Mega Millions were &quot;applied exclusively to or in aid or support of education in this state&quot; as required by NY Constitution, art I, &sect; 9 (1). The necessary net proceeds, less the required administrative expenses, remained in New York and were appropriately dedicated to education within the state.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner was the owner of a business that sold cigarettes.

The business owner claimed that the bill at issue was not validly passed pursuant to N.Y. Const. art.

The court disagreed and held that, as long as the Governor's certificate contained some factual statements, the sufficiency of the stated facts to support the Governor's conclusion was not subject to challenge.

As long as the Governor's certificate contains some factual statements, the sufficiency of the stated facts to support the Governor's conclusion may not be challenged.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant town sought review of the order from the Appellate Division (New York), which affirmed the order from the trial court ruling that respondent telephone company did not have to pay a special ad valorem levy for garbage collection on the company's &quot;mass properties&quot; under N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 102(14).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The telephone company owned and maintained enclosures for electrical conductors within the town. The equipment, referred to as &quot;mass property,&quot; was situated within the town's refuse and garbage district. The mass properties were not amenable to human occupation, produced no garbage of any kind, and neither required nor received garbage collection. Nevertheless, the town subjected them to a special ad valorem levy for garbage collection. The company successfully contested the levy. On appeal from the appellate division's affirmation, the court affirmed, finding that &sect; 102(14) did not authorize the town to impose a special ad valorem levy for garbage collection on the properties, because the properties did not and could not receive any direct benefit from the municipal service. The court noted that in contrast, a vacant lot or a home whose owners did not produce garbage could not opt out from paying the tax because the property &quot;benefitted&quot; from the service. The court found that as a class of property, telephone poles could never require municipal garbage collection; thus for the purposes of a special ad valorem levy to finance garbage collection, they therefore were not benefited.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;RPTL 102 (14), which limits special ad valorem levies to &quot;benefited&quot; properties, does not authorize a town to impose a special ad valorem levy for garbage collection on a telephone company's mass properties (transmission equipment), because they do not and cannot receive any direct benefit from that municipal service. That telephone poles, wire and the like constitute real property (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;RPTL 102 [12] [d]) does not mean that they fall into the category of benefited properties. In determining whether a property is benefited-- i.e., whether it is capable of receiving the municipal service funded by the special ad valorem levy--the innate features and legally permissible uses of the property are considered, not the particularities of its owners or occupants or the state of the property at a fixed point in time. As a class of property, telephone poles can never produce or require municipal garbage collection. For the purposes of a special ad valorem levy to finance garbage collection, they therefore are not benefited. </SPAN></P>

The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance allocated 100 percent of the employee's income to New York State, finding that the employee's out-of-state work was not performed at the necessity of the employer. The Department's findings were affirmed on administrative review, and the employee's N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding was dismissed. Affirming, the court held that full taxation of the employee's income was proper under N.Y. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 601(e), 631(b)(1)(B). The &quot;rule of convenience&quot; test for determining whether or not income paid by a New York employer was taxable by the State did not affect constitutional rights, and the court declined to adopt a proportionality requirement to the existing due process precedent when the income was not connected with the employer's participation in interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Personal Income Tax -- Income of Nonresident Employed by New York Employer -- Convenience of Employer Test </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under New York's &quot;convenience of the employer&quot; test (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;20 NYCRR 132.18 [a]), when a nonresident is employed by a New York employer, income derived from work in another state is taxable by New York unless performed out of state for the necessity of the employer. New York taxes the income of nonresidents to the extent that such income is &quot;derived from or connected with New York sources&quot; (Tax Law &sect; 631 [b] [1]; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tax Law &sect; 601 [e]), including any income attributable to &quot;a business, trade, profession or occupation carried on in this state&quot; (Tax Law &sect; 631 [b] [1] [B]). The minimal connection required by due process between the taxpayer and the taxing state was present in this case where the nonresident taxpayer accepted employment from a New York employer and worked in his employer's New York office approximately 25% of the time annually. By taxing only income sourced to New York, the convenience test is rationally related to values connected with New York because New York has the right to tax 100% of a nonresident employee's income derived from New York sources. The convenience test complies with both the Due Process Clause and the Commerce Clause. The Equal Protection Clause is also satisfied since, in distinguishing between those employees who work out of state for personal convenience and those who work out of state as a necessity, New York properly taxes nonresidents only on income sourced to New York, and, concomitantly, avoids taxing income derived from interstate commerce. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, affirming his convictions of first-degree manslaughter and a weapons offense, arguing that the trial court had erred in quashing a subpoena to compel production of a videotaped recording of his initial interrogation made by television documentary makers. He argued the N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 79-h(c) was unconstitutional as applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A legal television network documentary crew following the lives of homicide detectives over a period of months was present at defendant's arrest and questioning following a fatal shooting. In preparation for trial, defense counsel sought, without success, to subpoena videotapes of early stages of questioning made by the crew, before the prosecution taped defendant's formal statement. The court of appeals found it unnecessary to address defendant's argument that quashing of his subpoena violated his constitutional fair trial guarantee because it held that he had satisfied the three-pronged test required to overcome a media organization's qualified privilege in unpublished nonconfidential information. Defendant had shown how material and critical it was to his arguments that the shooting itself had been in self-defense and that detectives, in earlier questioning, had effectively coerced him into giving his later, formal statement, and it was certainly unobtainable from any other source. Finally, the court of appeals remarked that detectives and prosecutors could not shield information from release by arguing that it was originally obtained by the media, with their help.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Disclosure -- Tapes of Defendant's Interrogation -- Shield Law </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was entitled pursuant to Civil Rights Law &sect; 79-h (c) (Shield Law) to the production of video and audio tapes of his police interrogation taken by a film company that was making a television show depicting custodial interrogations. The Shield Law affords journalists and newscasters a qualified privilege in nonconfidential news, which news will only be disclosed if the party seeking such news demonstrates that it is highly material and relevant, is critical or necessary to a party's claim or defense, and is not obtainable from any alternative source. Defendant intended to use the tapes in support of his defenses that he acted in self-defense and that his statements were involuntary. Because the tapes constituted the only depictions of his interrogation by the police, defendant met his burden under Civil Rights Law &sect; 79-h (c) as a matter of law. That defendant was provided with the brief videotaped statement he ultimately gave to the prosecutor did not lessen the importance of the evidence he sought. The trial court erred in considering only the allegedly coercive statements that defendant claimed had been made to him by the police, and in analyzing each such statement in isolation. A jury's assessment of the voluntariness of defendant's statements may involve more than an analysis of the words spoken to and by him. Here, only the tapes could establish those intangibles that might properly be considered. Finally, the police may not immunize themselves from their obligation to provide defendants with copies of their own taped statements simply by letting a news organization--invited into the room by the police--operate the cameras. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Chief Administrative Judge of the Courts and a judge of the New York State Office of Court Administration, appealed the order of the Appellate Division (New York), which held that an amendment to N.Y. R. Chief Admin. Off. Ct. Admin. 127.2 (2001), made by an administrative law judge, was unconstitutional. Plaintiff attorneys had commenced a declaratory judgment action to challenge the constitutionality of Rule 127.2(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorneys each participated in the assigned counsel plan for a county. The director of the assigned counsel plan had submitted a request for the review of an enhanced fee award to the Chief Administrative Judge appointed by Rule 127.2(b) to review the excess compensation awarded to criminal defense attorneys. The Chief Administrative Judge modified each enhanced award by reducing the compensation to the maximum rates set forth in N.Y. County Law &sect; 722-b (1986). The trial court determined that by amending Rule 127.2(b), the Chief Administrative Judge did not exceed the authority granted to him. The appellate division reversed the trial court judgment and vacated the Chief Administrative Judge's orders modifying the trial courts' excess compensation awards, reinstated the original excess compensation awards, and declared Rule 127.2(b) null and void.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Administrative Judge acted within the authority granted him by the New York State Constitution when he amended Rules of the Chief Administrator of the Courts (22 NYCRR) &sect;127.2 (b) so as to permit an administrative judge to review an order of a trial judge setting an award of compensation in excess of the statutory limits set forth in County Law &sect; 722-b. The allocation of finite financial resources for the payment of assigned counsel is a concern for court administrators, and with the advice and consent of the Administrative Board, the Chief Administrative Judge properly promulgated section 127.2 (b) pursuant to his delegated authority under 22 NYCRR 80.1 to adopt rules for the efficient and orderly transaction of trial court business. By making no provision in the County Law for any review of excess compensation awards, the Legislature created a gap in the administrative process that the Chief Administrative Judge was entitled to fill. Section 127.2 (b) does not confer upon an administrative judge any authority that would otherwise belong to the appellate courts, or intrude upon the Legislature's authority to regulate proceedings in law. Given that the award of compensation fees is an administrative rather than a judicial act of the trial judge, the Legislature could not by statute divest the Chief Administrative Judge of his constitutional authority to supervise the administration and operation of the Unified Court System.  </SPAN></P>

The restrictions on which grant of a land use permit was conditioned simply assured that the EPODs would be honored. The court noted, first, that unless an exaction was found, such limits on land use were reviewed simply to see whether a landowner had been deprived of all viable uses of land and whether a significant governmental interest was implicated. Since there was no demand for dedication of the property that would have interfered with the landowners' possessory interests, there was no exaction, so a strict standard was not applicable to the regulation. The court went on to find that the landowners would still be able to build on their property, subject to restrictions that already applied to them anyway, and that the government had a strong interest in environmental protection.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent municipality did not commit an unconstitutional taking when it conditioned site plan approval upon petitioner landowners' acceptance of a conservation restriction on any development in the areas of petitioners' property located within municipal environmental protection overlay districts (EPODs). The conservation restriction sought by respondent closely tracked the limitations already set by the EPOD regulations, but it also encumbered the servient property in perpetuity, and afforded respondent greater enforcement power. The restriction was not, however, a dedication of property to public use constituting an &quot;exaction&quot; subject to the &quot;rough proportionality&quot; standard of constitutional scrutiny. Rather, it was subject to the less stringent determination of whether it substantially advanced legitimate state interests. As the restriction did not appreciably diminish the value of petitioners' property, and it substantially advanced the legitimate government purpose of environmental preservation by advancing respondent's aim of preserving environmentally sensitive areas in perpetuity, placing future buyers on notice of the development limitations on petitioners' property, and furnishing respondent with a more effective means of ensuring compliance with its regulatory objectives, it did not constitute a regulatory taking. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted consolidated review to appeals by legislators, plaintiffs in the first case and defendants in the second, from New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, affirmances of declaratory judgments in favor of New York's governor, defendant in the first case and plaintiff in the second. The legislators had challenged the governor's argument that in violation of N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4, appropriations bills had been altered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Const. art. VII set forth an executive system of budget construction, under which the executive branch proposed appropriations, and the legislature's power was to vote up or down, deleting items if it wished, but not adding or making substitutions. In the first case, the court agreed that the legislature's attempt to modify the budget by amending appropriations bills after passing them created invalid legislation, which could not have been upheld even if the governor had not vetoed them. In the second case, the legislators argued that the governor had overstepped his bounds by submitting bills that did not resemble traditional appropriations bills, such as an educational funding bill that contained incentives promoting policy objectives. The court did not hold that the governor could propose anything, call it an appropriations bill, and have it protected by N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4. It held that the governor had not reached that point. Spending bills implicated policy, and the education bill simply did it in a new way. It was still an appropriations bill, and, in such a circumstance, the resulting tensions would have to be resolved in a political forum and not in the courts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Budget -- Power of Legislature to Alter Governor's Budget Bills </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The 1998 legislative amendments to the Governor's nonappropriation budget bills, which altered the purposes for and conditions upon which the appropriated funds could be spent, unconstitutionally altered the Governor's appropriation bills in violation of NY Constitution, art VII, &sect; 4. The effect of the Legislature's amendments was to amend language originally proposed by the Governor in his 1998 appropriation bills. The no-alteration clause of the Constitution restricts the power of the Legislature to alter an appropriation bill submitted by the Governor &quot;except to strike out or reduce items therein.&quot; If it were read to prohibit only amendments to appropriation bills before passage, and not subsequent amendments, it would be a completely formal, ineffectual requirement. Nor may subsequent legislation amend the words of appropriation bills so long as it leaves the dollar amounts untouched. The theory that the Legislature can rewrite the text of the Governor's appropriation bills is inconsistent with the basic idea of executive budgeting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Budget -- Power of Legislature to Alter Governor's Budget Bills </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature, by enacting 37 single-purpose bills in 2001 to replace items it struck out from the Governor's appropriation bills, unconstitutionally altered the Governor's appropriation bills in violation of NY Constitution, art VII, &sect; 4. The use of single-purpose bills is no different in principle from the use of other legislation to amend appropriation bills, both of which are contrary to the idea of executive budgeting. Although there may be cases in which it is difficult to say whether a single-purpose bill passed by the Legislature is an &quot;addition&quot; to, rather than a &quot;substitution&quot; for, a deleted item, here it was clear from the Legislature's own description of the bills it defended that they were substitutes for items in the Governor's appropriation bills.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Budget -- Power of Legislature to Alter Governor's Budget Bills </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Governor's 2001 appropriation bills, challenged by the Legislature as not being, in significant part, appropriation bills within the meaning of the Constitution, were true fiscal measures designed to allocate the state's resources in the way the Governor thinks most productive and efficient and thus protected by the nonalteration clause of NY Constitution, art VII, &sect; 4. Although a Governor should not put into an appropriation bill essentially nonfiscal or nonbudgetary legislation, the line between appropriations and policy is difficult to fix. Here, however, none of the challenged appropriation bills appeared to be a device for achieving collateral ends under the guise of budgeting, and the Legislature was not free to alter them as it did.  </SPAN></P>

If a defendant fails to supply a notice of alibi or calls a witness not specified in it, the statute gives the trial court discretion only to exclude the alibi testimony or receive it after granting the prosecution an adjournment (CPL 250.20 [3]). There was no basis to allow the sanction imposed here. However, the improper introduction of the alibi notice was harmless in view of overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A New York county board of elections consisted of two commissioners, one from each of the two major political parties. Petitioner, the Republican commissioner, sued on statutory and constitutional grounds actions by respondent county relating to board staffing and funding. The supreme court denied the county's motion to dismiss. The New York Appellate Division reversed the judgment and dismissed the petition. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether a single election commissioner could bring suit to challenge county actions that allegedly impaired the equal representation of the major political parties in the staffing of a local board of elections. The Appellate Division found that as a sole commissioner of a two-commissioner board of elections, petitioner could not pursue his claim. The court of appeals concluded, however, that the right to pursue such a claim was implicit in the constitutional and statutory requirement of a balanced partisan representation on local boards of election. Petitioner lacked capacity to pursue the part of his claim predicated on the county's interference with board functions as a whole. However, petitioner's other claim--that county's actions resulted in intermittent political imbalance on the board of elections--stated a cognizable claim. Further, petitioner alleged an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing to pursue his claim. N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 3-300 required &quot;equal representation of the major political parties&quot; on boards of elections. The requirement of bipartisanship on local boards of elections was an important component of our democratic process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a combined declaratory judgment action and CPLR article 78 proceeding brought by petitioner election commissioner contesting the actions of respondent County relating to Board of Elections staffing and funding, petitioner lacked capacity to pursue the part of his claim predicated on the County's interference with Board functions as a whole. The aspect of his claim alleging that the County's imposition of a hiring freeze and its refusal to authorize the expenditure of funds for training impaired the ability of Board staff to properly prepare for upcoming elections addressed the broad functioning of the Board. A lawsuit that raises concerns affecting the staff of both political parties is an &quot;action&quot; requiring approval of a majority of the commissioners under Election Law &sect; 3-212 (2). Absent such approval, petitioner lacked capacity to pursue those complaints against the County.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

The right to pursue such a claim is implicit in the constitutional and statutory requirement of balanced partisan representation on local boards of elections. Although Election Law &sect; 3-212 (2) requires that &quot;[a]ll actions of the board shall require a majority vote,&quot; that statute is not implicated when a commissioner files a claim to assure equal representation on behalf of his or her political party.

Assuming the truth of petitioner's allegations and affording petitioner the benefit of every favorable inference, the petition stated a cognizable claim that the County's actions--particularly repeated delays in authorizing hiring requests without reasonable basis--resulted in unequal political representation on the Board on multiple occasions over a two-year period.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant candidates sought review from an order of the Appellate Division (New York), which affirmed a trial court order holding that absentee ballots from a special general election were not to be canvassed because respondent Albany County Board of Elections failed to follow the set procedure for those voters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to a challenge to a redistricting plan, the Board was enjoined from conducting primary and general elections for certain county districts. A special primary election was directed, with a special general election to be held &quot;expeditiously thereafter.&quot; Absentee ballot requests for the first special election were based on prior requests, but new requests had to be made for the general election. However, the Board forwarded absentee ballots for that election as well, based on the prior requests. Candidates in two close races thereafter challenged those absentee ballots, as they violated the procedure that was to be followed. The trial court held that the ballots should not be canvassed, which decision was affirmed on appeal. On further review due to dissenting opinions, the court found that the ballots were in violation of the federal court order that directed the procedure to be followed, as well as in violation of N.Y. Elec. Law art. 8. The court concluded that the Board's error was not technical, ministerial, or inconsequential because it was central to the substantive process, and the voters who used absentee ballots were not determined to be &quot;duly qualified electors.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- Absentee Ballots</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Absentee ballots collected in violation of both a federal court order and article 8 of the Election Law were invalid. The federal court order directed that registered voters who had filed applications requesting absentee ballots for the previous general election would be sent absentee ballots for a special primary election and that the process for obtaining and counting absentee ballots for the special general election would be governed by the Election Law. However, the Board of Elections forwarded absentee ballots for the special general election to any voter who had requested one during the previous general election. The Legislature's carefully crafted procedure for ensuring the validity of absentee votes was circumvented by the Board's decision to forward absentee ballots to voters who had not applied for them. These voters never articulated why they were not able to vote at the polls on the day of the special general election, as article 8 of the Election Law and the federal court order required. Although there are instances where inconsequential deviations from the letter of the law will not be fatal, the Board's error here could not be characterized as technical, ministerial or inconsequential, because it was central to the substantive process by which voters are determined to be qualified to cast absentee ballots. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, petitioner physician asked that respondents, the State Board for Professional Medical Conduct and the Department of Health, be compelled to withdraw information about professional disciplinary proceedings from public access and keep them confidential. The trial court dismissed the petition. The Appellate Division (New York) reversed and granted it. The Board and Department sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Board for Professional Medical Conduct brought charges against the physician arising from an alleged romantic encounter with a patient and from failing to record a telephonic prescription for the patient a week later. The charges from the alleged encounter were dismissed, but the latter charge was sustained. The court of appeals held, in physician disciplinary proceedings, which were required to be confidential until a final resolution was reached, this confidentiality requirement continued when the charges against the physician were not sustained. When some charges were dismissed and others were sustained, the Department of Health had discretion in whether to make all charges public, but it was an abuse of discretion to make the dismissed charges public because the dismissed charges and the sustained charge were very different in kind and gravity, and the dismissed charges and the sustained charge did not arise out of simultaneous or closely-connected events. It was impossible to justify permitting a minor, technical violation to result in sensational, but discredited, charges of serious wrongdoing becoming available to the public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The requirement that a physician disciplinary proceeding remain confidential until finally determined, as provided for in Public Health Law &sect; 230 (9), continues to exist after a determination in the physician's favor. The confidentiality provided for in the statute is not limited to pending proceedings. Other statutory provisions require that proceedings in which physicians were subjected to administrative warnings, consultations, or monitoring orders remain confidential. It would be inconsistent to grant the public access to records of terminated proceedings that led to a physician's complete exoneration.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and Surgeons -- Disciplinary Proceedings -- Dissemination of Unsustained Charges Together with Sustained Charge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent Department of Health abused its discretion by releasing to the public all of the charges and their disposition in a physician disciplinary proceeding against petitioner, who was exonerated of all the charges except one minor one not closely related to the others. In cases where disciplinary proceedings lead to a mixed result, respondent has discretion in deciding whether its records should be redacted to keep confidential material relating to the charges that were not sustained. Here, the dismissed charges, which related to a romantic encounter and involved alleged abuse of a patient's trust, and the charge that was sustained, which related to a telephoned prescription and involved a bit of carelessness in record-keeping, were very different in kind and gravity, and did not arise out of simultaneous or closely-connected events. There was no justification for permitting a &quot;technical violation&quot; to result in sensational, but discredited, charges of serious wrongdoing becoming available to the public.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Suffolk County Supreme Court (New York), which convicted defendant of first degree murder in the course of and in furtherance of first degree rape. Defendant was sentenced to death. The direct appeal was before the court pursuant to its unique jurisdiction in death penalty cases as provided for in N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3(b) and in N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 450.70(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from his confession to raping and killing a woman jogger. Defendant's various contentions of error were found meritless in that a challenged juror showed impartiality in all of his answers to the voir dire questions and stated he was able to consider any mitigation required by law with regard to the death penalty. The trial court was found to have properly denied defendant's request for self-representation where it was determined that defendant's request was merely an attempt to have his counsel discharged. Testimony from the victim's husband was held material because it explained the sequence of events from discovering his wife missing to later discovering her body. Though irrelevant information was also brought forth in the husband's testimony, it was minimal. The court did find that the deadlock jury instruction given was unconstitutional and required that defendant be resentenced. The court held that the deadlock instruction that informed the jury of a court's imposition of a lesser penalty if the jury was unable to find unanimity created a substantial risk of juror coercion to sentence a defendant to death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment by vacating the sentence. The court remitted the case to the trial court for resentencing. As so modified, the court otherwise affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Selection of Jury -- Capital Murder Trial -- Ability to Serve Impartially</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a capital murder prosecution, the trial court properly denied defendant's challenge for cause of a prospective juror who initially thought defendant was guilty, and whose answers during voir dire were allegedly different from those on his written questionnaire. When asked to respond to answers from his questionnaire, the potential juror gave answers evidencing impartiality. He unequivocally indicated that he would follow the court's instruction not to give police testimony more weight than that of other witnesses, and stated that the fact that he, like the deceased, was a runner would not affect him. Moreover, the potential juror assured the trial court of his ability to be impartial, that he would base his decision on the evidence presented at trial, that he would consider whatever mitigation was required by law, and that he had no preconceived notion of how defendant should be punished. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Representation Pro Se -- Capital Murder Trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a capital murder prosecution where the lead counsel had a total breakdown in his relationship with defendant on the eve of trial, the trial court did not err in permitting defendant's lead counsel to withdraw, elevating the existing associate counsel to lead counsel, and appointing a new associate counsel rather than allowing defendant to proceed pro se. Defendant's request to represent himself was not clearly and unequivocally presented. Initially, defendant made the conditional statement that if the court forced him to go along with the strategy of his attorneys, he would ask to represent himself, but he did not assertively state that he wanted to represent himself. He then stated that he saw self-representation as his last option, though he did not want to represent himself because he did not know anything about the law. When he mentioned self-representation for the last time, he again couched it as a hypothetical, adding the request for new lawyers as an alternative. His statements did not reflect a definitive commitment to self-representation. Rather, he raised the specter of self-representation as a means of procuring the lead counsel's dismissal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Disclosure -- Failure to Disclose Exculpatory Material</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a capital murder prosecution, statements from two witnesses who drank alcohol and took drugs with defendant the night before the murder, while containing some measure of favorable evidence, were not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> material that the People were obligated to provide to defendant. The People submitted the statements to the trial court, which decided that the prosecution had satisfied its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> obligation. The evidence was not suppressed by the prosecution, because defendant knew or should have known that he drank alcohol and took drugs with the witnesses, whose names and addresses he knew. Moreover, defense counsel, in an affirmation seeking the statements, admitted that the defense believed that the statements dealt with use of alcohol and drugs the night before the murder. Possession of the statements would not have revealed any essential information that the defense did not already know. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial -- Testimony of Victim's Spouse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a capital murder prosecution, testimony by the victim's husband during the guilt phase of the trial was not an improper victim-impact statement constituting reversible error. Much of the testimony was material to the issues before the jury and properly admitted because it explained the sequence of events, from his discovery that his wife was missing to learning that his wife's body had been found later in the day. While there was testimony that was irrelevant to the sequence of events, such as that the victim had a Master's degree, such testimony was minimal and harmless where the proof was overwhelming and there was no significant probability that, but for this error, the jury would have acquitted defendant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Review -- Prosecutor's Guilt Phase Summation in Capital Murder Trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Defendant's motion for a mistrial after the prosecutor's summation at the end of the guilt phase of defendant's capital murder trial was insufficient to preserve the arguments defendant made on appeal regarding the alleged improprieties committed by the prosecutor during the summation. The alleged improprieties included inviting jurors to relive the victim's suffering by expressing that words could not describe what she must have experienced; referring to the good fortune of another victim who survived her encounter with defendant and the murder victim's cruel fate; lamenting the pain of those the victim left behind; degrading defendant by characterizing him as a killer whale; arguing that defendant received the benefit of due process while the victim did not; and urging the community to avenge, and thereby heal. Although several of the prosecutor's remarks were improper, reversal would not be warranted even if defendant had properly preserved his claims. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Capital Murder -- Deadlock Instruction </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> under State Constitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The deadlock instruction required by CPL 400.27 (10) in a capital murder case, pursuant to which a judge must tell jurors that if they fail to unanimously agree upon a sentence of either death or life without parole, the judge would sentence the defendant to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving a minimum of 20 to 25 years, is unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the State Constitution (NY Const, art I, &sect; 6). The instruction has an unacceptable risk that it may result in a coercive, and thus arbitrary and unreliable, sentence. Whether a juror chooses death or life without the possibility of parole, the choice is driven by the fear that a deadlock may result in the eventual release of the defendant, and does not satisfy the heightened standard of reliability required by the State Constitution. Moreover, future dangerousness is not a statutory aggravator that the jury may consider. Accordingly, the appropriate remedy was to vacate the sentence and remit the case to Supreme Court for resentencing in accordance with CPL 470.30 (5) (c) and Penal Law &sect;&sect; 60.06 and 70.00. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Capital Murder -- Deadlock Instruction </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> under State Constitution -- Effect on Pending Capital Murder Prosecutions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The death penalty may not be imposed under the present capital murder statute, which contains in CPL 400.27 (10) an unconstitutional deadlock instruction pursuant to which a judge must tell jurors that if they fail to unanimously agree upon a sentence of either death or life without parole, the judge would sentence the defendant to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving a minimum of 20 to 25 years. A jury instruction on the consequences of deadlock is required in a capital case, but a new instruction cannot be crafted by the Court, because to do so would usurp legislative prerogative. Cases in which death notices have been filed may go forward as noncapital first degree murder prosecutions.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Workers' Compensation Board (WCB) appealed the order of the Appellate Division (New York), which affirmed the trial court's order granting petitioner physicians' petition to annul the portion of N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 12, &sect; 300.2 that required physicians to be American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) or American Osteopathic Association (AOA) board-certified in order to conduct independent medical examinations (IMEs).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2000, the legislature enacted the Injured Workers Protection Act, 2000 N.Y. Laws ch. 473, &sect; 2, to address problems with the IME process. The Act added N.Y. Workers' Comp. Law &sect; 137 to provide that only a New York state licensed and board certified physician, surgeon, podiatrist or any other person authorized to examine or evaluate injury or illness by the board was to perform IMEs. The WCB denied the physicians' requests for authorization to conduct IMEs because they were not certified by an appropriate medical specialty board. They then sought to annul the portion of N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 12, &sect; 300.2 that required physicians to be ABMS or AOA board-certified in order to conduct IMEs. The trial court granted the petition in part, finding that the term &quot;board certified&quot; referred to the WCB. The Appellate Division affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the most natural interpretation was that &quot;board certified&quot; referred to certification by a medical specialty board. The court found also that the regulations requiring certification by the ABMS or AOA were rational because they promoted the Act by providing a greater level of quality assurance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Workers' Compensation -- Treatment and Care of Injured Employees -- Requirement That Independent Examining Physicians be Board Certified -- Statutory Definition</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The term &quot;board certified,&quot; as used in Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 137 (3) to require that physicians or surgeons performing independent medical examinations be board certified, means certification by a medical specialty board, not certification by the Workers' Compensation Board (WCB). The phrase &quot;board certified&quot; is a term of art, typically understood to refer to approval by a designated group of professionals. While the word &quot;board&quot; on its own within the Workers' Compensation Law may refer to the WCB, there are several places in the law where it is not used to refer to the WCB. Moreover, the Legislature has also used the term &quot;board certified&quot; in other statutes to refer to a medical specialty board. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Workers' Compensation -- Treatment and Care of Injured Employees -- Requirement That Independent Examining Physicians be Board Certified -- Regulatory Definition</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Workers' Compensation Board regulations defining a board certified independent medical examiner as a physician or surgeon certified by a specialty board recognized by either the American Board of Medical Special ties (ABMS) or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;12 NYCRR 300.2 [b] [2] [ii] [a]; [3]) are rational. Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 137 (3) requires that physicians or surgeons performing independent medical examinations (IMEs) be board certified, and ABMS and AOA are organizations of approved medical and osteopathic specialty boards. Requiring such board certification provides a greater level of quality assurance, and promotes the purpose of the Injured Workers' Protection Act, which was enacted to address problems with the IME process.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent grandparents sought review of the order from the Appellate Division (New York), which granted petitioner parents' request to modify a third-party visitation order and terminate visitation based on a change in circumstances since issuance of the initial order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents had been estranged from their daughter since prior to her marriage. When their first granddaughter was an infant, they filed a petition pursuant to N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 72 seeking visitation. The parents opposed the petition, but the parties reached an agreement which was incorporated into a family court order that provided that the grandparents would have eight hours of visitation every month and the parties would begin family counseling. After several months of visitation, the parents sought unsuccessfully to discontinue the visitation and vacate the order, alleging that the visits were an &quot;unmitigated disaster,&quot; and citing one incident where the mother called the police for aid in removing the grandparents from her home at the end of a visit with her daughter. The appellate division vacated the visitation order, finding that the parents had demonstrated a change in circumstances reflecting that the visitation was no longer in the child's best interest. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that grandparent visitation must yield where, as here, strained relations with a child's parents rendered the continuation of visitation not in the child's best interests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Visitation Rights of Grandparents -- Modification of Visitation Order Based On Change of Circumstances </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a proceeding to modify a Family Court order that granted visitation to the subject child's grandparents, the Appellate Division properly found that terminating visitation was in the child's best interest. A grandparent visitation order (Domestic Relations Law &sect;72) may be modified only upon a showing that there has been a subsequent change of circumstances and modification is required (Family Ct Act &sect; 467 [b] [ii]). The standard to be applied is the best interests of the child when all of the applicable factors are considered. Here, after the commencement of visitation, the already-strained relationship between the parents and grandparents further deteriorated. Termination of visitation was in the child's best interest because it would shield her from the animosity and dysfunction between the parents and grandparents and reduce the &quot;paralyzing&quot; stress experienced by the child's mother attendant to the visitation. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Local Government Assistance Corporation (LGAC) appealed and defendants, a city and a non-profit corporation, cross-appealed a decision of the Appellate Division (New York), which modified a supreme court order granting the LGAC's summary judgment motion, which challenged the constitutionality of N.Y.

Modifying the order and declaring the Act constitutional, the court held that (1) the amendment to N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 3240(5) did not implicate N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 11 because, inter alia, the Act, as a whole, made clear that the legislature had an incentive, but not an obligation, to appropriate; (2) the city was not required to pledge its faith and credit under N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Municipal Assistance Corporation Refinancing Act (L 2003, ch 62, part A4; ch 63, part V), enacted to provide for an annual appropriation of funds to defendant New York City in order to assist the City in retiring certain long-term debt, does not violate the constitutional prohibition in NY Constitution article VII, &sect; 11, against imposing upon the State a multiyear payment obligation without subjecting the payments to either a referendum or a legislative appropriation. The 30 annual payments that plaintiff Local Government Assistance Corporation (LGAC) is required to make on behalf of the State to the City under the Act, which was passed without a public referendum, are subject to annual appropriations in satisfaction of that constitutional provision. The Act's amendment to Public Authorities Law &sect; 3240 (5) does not obligate the State to provide the funds for LGAC's payments even without an appropriation. The amendment was intended to prevent the State from changing the specific timing of the payments mandated under the Act. The Act otherwise continues explicitly to require that the payments be subject to annual legislative appropriation. </SPAN></P>

The Act permits the City to assign to defendant Sales Tax Asset Receivable Corporation (STARC) the City's right to receive the annual payments plaintiff Local Government Assistance Corporation (LGAC) is required to make to the City on behalf of the State. The City did not incur any enforceable debt with respect to the assignment because it has no legal obligation either to STARC or to its bondholders should LGAC fail to make its payments to STARC. Moreover, even if the City would otherwise have an interest in the LGAC payments, the diversion of municipal funds to a public benefit corporation does not necessarily run afoul of the State Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

While Public Authorities Law &sect; 3238-a, as added by the Act, requires Local Government Assistance Corporation (LGAC) to make annual payments to the City on behalf of the State, it does not modify or repeal the State's pledge to honor the contractual rights and remedies of LGAC's bondholders pursuant to Public Authorities Law &sect; 3241 (1). Pursuant to their contract with LGAC, and as confirmed in section 3241 (1), the bondholders have first priority on LGAC's appropriated funds. Section 3238-a does not expressly undermine section 3241 (1) or otherwise establish a new order of priority on the payments LGAC must make from its appropriated funds.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner financial services company sued respondents, the New York State Division of Tax Appeals and the Tax Appeals Tribunal (New York), seeking review of the Tribunal's decision denying the company's request for a refund of sales taxes paid on certain uncollectible debts. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, Third Department, upheld the Tribunal's decision, and the court of appeals granted leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A financial services company purchased rights which vendors had to pursue customers who purchased items on credit, but had not paid their credit card bills. The company purchased those accounts for the face amount of the total indebtedness, which included sales taxes the vendors had already paid to the New York State Division of Taxation. Although the company attempted to collect amounts the customers owed, it was not successful in every case, and it ultimately determined that certain accounts were uncollectible. It wrote those debts off and filed claims with the Division, seeking refunds of sales taxes that were paid by vendors who sold their accounts. However, the Division rejected the claims, and the Tax Appeals Tribunal upheld that judgment. The court of appeals held that N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 20, &sect; 534.7(b)(3) expressly precluded third-party assignees such as the financial services company from applying for a refund of sales taxes arising from bad debts, the regulation was valid and had the force and effect of law, and the intermediate appellate court's judgment upholding the Tax Appeals Tribunal's decision was correct.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Division of Taxation's denial of the application made by petitioner financial services company for a refund of sales taxes paid by retail vendors on debts that were assigned to petitioner and proved to be uncollectible was not arbitrary or capricious. Although the vendors themselves would have been entitled to apply for a refund, petitioner, as a third-party assignee of the vendors, was precluded from applying by 20 NYCRR 534.7 (b) (3). That regulation is consistent with the enabling legislation, Tax Law &sect; 1132 (e), which provides that the Division of Taxation &quot;may,&quot; by regulation, provide refunds for sales taxes paid on uncollectible debts. The Commissioner articulated a rational explanation for distinguishing between who is and who is not permitted to seek sales tax refunds. </SPAN></P>

Although claims lawfully transferred are generally enforceable, General Obligations Law &sect; 13-105 provides an exception to that rule where, as here, the rights of a party to a transferred claim are regulated by special provision of law.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On direct, mandatory appeal of a judgment on a jury verdict entered by the Monroe County Court (New York), which convicted defendant of first-degree murder and related crimes and sentenced him to death, defendant argued primarily that imposition of the death penalty was unconstitutional, that his confession had not been voluntary, and that admission of statements regarding three other murders, despite an order of exclusion, mandated reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's statements indicated that he either shot the murder victim himself or had his wife shoot the victim. He was sentenced to death after a trial conducted under direction by an intermediate to ignore the trial court's belief that forcing a defendant to choose between pleading guilty and facing the death penalty was unconstitutional. The instant court had subsequently embraced the same view as the trial court. Under those circumstances, the death sentence could not stand. The evidence was ample, however, to support conviction under either theory of the facts, and it made no difference that in the respective trials of defendant and his wife prosecutors had referred to both versions, or that some jurors might have believed one version of events and others another version, since either one supported guilt of the same crime. Defendant's confession, eagerly offered in hopes of exculpating his family, but without promises, was clearly voluntary. Finally, it was not error for the trial court to allow the prosecution, on rebuttal, to allow inquiry into matters covered in excluded statements, since defendant had opened the door to such an inquiry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment by vacating the death sentence but affirmed the judgment in all other respects. It remitted the matter for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Capital Murder -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Plea Provisions</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant, having been prosecuted for capital murder under an unconstitutional two-tiered penalty scheme procedure in which only those defendants who exercised their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial put themselves at risk of death, was entitled to have his death sentence stricken. The plea provisions had initially been declared unconstitutional by the trial court, but the subsequent declaration by the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, prior to defendant's trial that the plea provisions were constitutional (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Relin v Connell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 251 A.D.2d 1041, 674 N.Y.S.2d 192) rendered those provisions operational in defendant's prosecution. After defendant was convicted, the Fourth Department was reversed and the provisions were struck as unconstitutional (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;92 N.Y.2d 613, 706 N.E.2d 1201, 684 N.Y.S.2d 177). Based on the binding precedent in effect at the time of defendant's trial, defendant could have sought to avoid exposure to a death sentence only by waiving his right to a jury trial and pleading guilty. Accordingly, the appropriate remedy was to vacate the sentence and remit the case to County Court for resentencing in accordance with CPL 470.30 (5) (c) and Penal Law &sect;&sect; 60.06 and 70.00 (5). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Capital Murder -- Felony Murder -- Conflicting Versions of Murder</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a prosecution for first degree murder under Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii) in which it was alleged that defendant kidnapped the victim and either fatally shot the victim himself, or commanded his wife to do so, the prosecutor did not violate due process by positing a different murder theory from that argued at the previous trial of defendant's wife. The prosecutor argued at both trials that defendant's wife shot the victim, and at both trials defendant was portrayed as the driving force behind the crime. An additional theory was offered at defendant's trial, based on his own written statement, that defendant pulled the trigger. The prosecutor never discredited the evidence he previously offered to convict defendant's wife, but instead used it to prove that defendant commanded her to shoot the victim. Under the circumstances, the People did not have to choose one defendant over the other to prosecute as the shooter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Capital Murder -- Felony Murder -- Conflicting Versions of Murder</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a prosecution for first degree felony murder under Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii), due process did not require that the prosecution's theory that defendant commanded his wife to shoot the victim be considered by the jury apart from the prosecution's other theory that defendant himself shot the victim. Nor did due process require that the jury be unanimous on one theory or another. The trial court properly instructed the jury that it could convict defendant of first degree murder either as a commander or as a shooter. &quot;Command&quot; is not set forth as a separate element of the first degree felony murder offense. Moreover, there is no moral disparity between actual killers and commanders which would prohibit treating them as alternative means to satisfy an element of first degree felony murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Capital Murder -- Murder in Furtherance of First Degree Kidnapping -- Verdict Not against Weight of Evidence</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Defendant's conviction under Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii) for committing first degree murder in the course of and in furtherance of first degree kidnapping was not against the weight of the evidence. It was undisputed that defendant engineered and carried out the armed kidnapping of the victim, decided to kill him, handcuffed him, and led him down to the basement, and that the victim died of an intentional gunshot wound to the head. Whether the jury believed that defendant ordered his wife to shoot the victim, as supported by the circumstantial evidence, or that defendant shot the victim himself, as he acknowledged in his written statement, it was justified in finding that defendant was squarely in charge of the kidnapping and shooting of the victim. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Confession -- Voluntariness of Confession</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. The confession defendant made while in custody was voluntary and admissible against him in his capital murder prosecution. Although one of the investigators questioning defendant told him that he would check on the status of the family members who were in the car with defendant at the time of his arrest, the investigator did not lead defendant to believe that he was receiving lenient treatment for family members in exchange for his confession. Defendant confessed without any prompting other than for more information. The investigators who questioned defendant were not required to dissuade him from making incriminating statements, or disabuse him of his fantasy that he could control the circumstances of the interrogation and win the release of his family. Moreover, defendant was given his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings, offered food, drink, cigarettes, and medical treatment for his injured leg, allowed two meetings with his brother and one with his wife, and permitted to call his mother. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Confession -- Admissibility of Confession to Unrelated Murders</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. Defendant was not deprived of a fair trial through the admission, following re-cross-examination of an investigator who had questioned defendant, of defendant's statements regarding murders other than the one for which he was prosecuted. The main issue for the jury was whether defendant was guilty of second degree murder as an accomplice, or intentional first degree murder as either the shooter or the person who commanded the shooter. The interrogation of defendant, as a whole, was probative of a material issue--defendant's motive for confessing to the murder for which he was prosecuted--and could have aided the jury in assessing the truthfulness of that portion of defendant's confession. Defendant himself made his motive for confessing an issue in his trial, and sought to exploit the trial court's pretrial ruling prohibiting the prosecution from eliciting testimony on direct examination regarding the portions of defendant's confession in which he admitted to the other murders, thereby opening the door to admission of his full confession. The trial court acted within the boundaries of discretion in ultimately concluding that the probative value of the full confession was not substantially outweighed by its potential for prejudice to defendant.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimants sought review from orders of the Appellate Division, Third Department (New York), in two separate cases which affirmed the Workers' Compensation Board's determinations to rescind all wage replacement awards made to the claimants after a set date, disqualified them from any future such benefits, and closed the cases, based on the Board's finding that the claimants had violated N.Y. Work. Comp. Law &sect; 114-a(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants separately sought benefits for injuries which occurred while they were working for their employers. Workers' compensation law judges (WCLJ) awarded benefits. On review, it was determined that one claimant had not violated &sect; 114-a(1) by failing to disclose a pre-existing injury, and that the other claimant had violated it by continuing to do work. However, the Board found that a violation had occurred in both cases, stopped the benefits, and closed the cases. The appellate division affirmed the Board in each case. On further appeal, the court concluded that the Board was acting within its authority in imposing the disqualification of benefits, even though there was no compensation that was &quot;directly attributable&quot; to a false statement. Although such a fact could have impeded the Board's action as it related to a mandatory penalty, the Board could impose such a disqualification under its discretionary power even though the forfeited compensation was not directly attributable to a false statement or representation. However, the record was inadequate for the court to determine whether the Board imposed the disqualification penalties in accordance with &sect; 114-a(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the orders of the appellate division and remanded the matter to the Board for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workers' Compensation -- Disqualification for False Representation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 114-a (1) authorizes the Workers' Compensation Board, in its discretion, to disqualify a claimant who makes a false statement or representation as to a material fact from receiving wage replacement benefits even though the forfeited compensation is not &quot;directly attributable&quot; to the false statement or representation. A fact is material for purposes of the statute so long as it is significant or essential to the issue or matter at hand, and therefore a false statement need not affect the dollar value of an award to be material within the meaning of the statute. The statute does not limit disqualification to cases where the false statement or representation negates the existence of a compensable injury, but rather allows for penalties to be imposed where a compensable injury exists. This discretionary penalty is in addition the mandatory penalty provided for under the statute for compensation directly attributable to false statements or representations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workers' Compensation -- Judicial Review -- Penalty Imposed for False Representation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In order for a reviewing court to assess whether Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 114-a (1) has been properly applied in the imposition of a penalty upon a claimant for making a false statement or representation concerning a material fact, the administrative record must, at a minimum, reflect whether a mandatory or discretionary penalty was imposed. If mandatory, the record must demonstrate a link between the false statement or representation and the forfeited compensation to show that the compensation was &quot;directly attributable&quot; to the false statement or representation. If discretionary, the record must reflect that the additional penalty does not exceed the mandatory penalty, or, in the case of disqualification, provide some basis for appellate review.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, in the Onondaga County Court (New York), of first degree murder under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.27(1)(a)(v) and (vii) and sentenced to death. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hit his wife with a bat and then poisoned her in her hospital room. The court of appeals held pre-trial publicity did not require a pre-voir dire venue change, as an unbiased jury could be found, and did not taint the jury pool. A search warrant affidavit using previously submitted matter met the particularity requirement. Defendant was not improperly denied a bench trial. Consolidating pre-death assault counts with post-death murder counts did not abuse discretion. Not dismissing for cause a juror whose domestic violence views impeded his ability to consider a life sentence was error. The People's challenge for cause to a juror who said she could follow the law despite opposing the death penalty was wrongly granted. This required only a new sentencing. While the evidence sufficiently supported finding defendant killed his wife to eliminate her as an assault witness, under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.27(1)(a)(v), the weight of the evidence did not. Defendant was not guilty of first degree murder for burglarizing his wife's hospital room as his intent to kill her could not both elevate his criminal trespass to burglary and his intentional murder to first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was modified by reducing defendant's conviction of two counts of first degree murder to one count of second degree murder and remitting the matter to the trial court for resentencing on second degree murder, as well as the remaining counts, and, as modified, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Venue -- Motion to Change Venue before Voir Dire </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's pre-voir dire motion pursuant to CPL 230.20 for a change of venue in his capital murder prosecution was properly denied. The county in which the case was venued was not deluged by a tidal wave of prejudicial publicity to such an extent that even an attempt to select an unbiased jury would be fruitless.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Venue -- Motion to Change Venue after Voir Dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant's post-voir dire motion pursuant to CPL 230.20 for a change of venue in his capital murder prosecution was properly denied. Although 86% of the prospective jurors had heard of the case from media accounts, the test for removal is not based on the number of prospective jurors who have heard of the case, but whether media or other accounts have been so inflammatory as to thwart the selection of a fair-minded jury. Here, most of the media coverage tended to be objective, and the publicity was not so sensational or prejudicial as to have tainted the jury pool. The voir dire successfully culled out jurors who may have been biased by pretrial publicity.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Search Warrant -- Incorporation by Reference in Warrant Application of Material Previously Submitted to Judge </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The search of a shed on defendant's property was authorized by a search warrant, notwithstanding that it referred only to defendant's house. The warrant explicitly noted that it was an addendum to a warrant issued three days before, which included searches for certain materials in defendant's home or &quot;within any unattached garage or storage shed.&quot; The warrant properly incorporated previously submitted materials known to the issuing judge, who signed five search warrants over four consecutive days related to defendant's prosecution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Capital Murder -- Defendant Not Entitled to Bench Trial </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant was not entitled to the option of a bench trial to alleviate the alleged prejudicial effects of pretrial publicity and consolidation of his indictments for assault and capital murder. There was no prejudicial impact from the pretrial publicity or the consolidation of the indictments. Moreover, state constitutional and statutory law prohibited defendant from waiving his right to a jury trial (NY Const, art I, &sect; 2; CPL 320.10), and he did not have a federal constitutional right to a bench trial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Consolidation and Severance -- Consolidation of Assault and Capital Murder Indictments </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing consolidation of defendant's assault and capital murder indictments for trial. CPL 200.20 (2) (b) permits joinder of offenses based on different criminal transactions if proof of one offense would be material and admissible in a trial for the other offense. Here, defendant was accused of assaulting his wife and then murdering her six months later while she was in the hospital recovering from her injuries. The prosecution based one of its murder charges on the victim's potential testimony in the assault trial, making proof of the assault relevant to the murder case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Consolidation and Severance -- Right to Plead Guilty to Part of Consolidated Indictment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Defendant, charged initially with assault, and then charged in a consolidated indictment almost seven months later with assault and capital murder, did not have a right to plead guilty to only the assault portion of the indictment. He could have pleaded guilty to assault before the indictments were consolidated. After consolidation, he could have pleaded guilty to the entire indictment, had the prosecution determined not to seek the death penalty, but not to only a portion of it without the consent of the prosecution and the court (CPL 220.10 [2], [4]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Selection of Jury -- Capital Murder Trial -- Ability to Serve Impartially</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In a capital murder prosecution, the trial court erred in allowing a prospective juror to remain on the panel where he initially indicated that he would be able to serve impartially, but later acknowledged that his views on domestic violence, an issue highly relevant to the case, would impede his ability to consider life without parole instead of death as an appropriate penalty. The test for determining whether a juror in a capital murder prosecution is life and death qualified, prescribed in CPL 270.20 (1) (f), is whether the juror expresses an inability to set aside his or her personal views on the death penalty in deference to the court's instructions. Here, the juror's initial expressions of open-mindedness were undermined by his later responses. The trial court should have granted defendant's challenge for cause, or at least questioned the juror as to whether these deeply held views would preclude him from serving impartially in a penalty phase before allowing him to remain on the panel.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Selection of Jury -- Capital Murder Trial -- Death Qualified</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In a capital murder prosecution, the trial court erred in granting the prosecution's challenge for cause of a prospective juror who stated during voir dire that &quot;in most instances&quot; the death penalty was wrong, but who repeatedly indicated during questioning that she could consider both death and life without parole as possible punishments for defendant. The test for determining whether a juror in a capital murder prosecution is life and death qualified, prescribed in CPL 270.20 (1) (f), is whether the juror expresses an inability to set aside his or her personal views on the death penalty in deference to the court's instructions. Here, the prospective juror was death qualified. Although she initially may have expressed reservations about the death penalty, after doing so she made it clear that she could follow her oath, act impartially and consider both the death penalty and life without parole. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Selection of Jury -- Capital Murder Trial -- Remedy for Penalty-Related Juror Selection Errors </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. In a capital murder prosecution, the trial court's erroneous rulings pertaining to two prospective jurors based on challenges that went only to their ability to deliberate fairly and impartially at the penalty phase did not justify a new guilt-phase trial. The appropriate remedy for an error made in the selection of an unqualified penalty phase juror in a capital murder prosecution is reversal of the sentence, as opposed to the entire trial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to be Present at Trial -- Waiver -- Sidebar Conferences</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Defendant's statutory right to be present at trial was not violated by his absence at two sidebar conferences during the group voir dire (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 260.20). Although a defendant's right to be present at trial extends to sidebar and robing room conferences with prospective jurors regarding possible bias, the right may be waived. Here, defendant waived his right to be present at the sidebar conferences, twice asserting on the record that he accepted and understood the waiver.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Capital Murder -- Witness Elimination -- Applicable Standard </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. In a prosecution for first degree murder based on witness elimination under Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (v), the statute is satisfied if the defendant's motivation to eliminate the victim as a witness is a substantial factor in murdering the victim, even though the defendant may have had mixed motives.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Capital Murder -- Witness Elimination -- Legal Sufficiency of Evidence</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Defendant's first degree murder conviction based on witness elimination under Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (v) for poisoning his wife with cyanide while she was in the hospital recovering from serious injuries he had inflicted upon her six months earlier was based on legally sufficient evidence. The prosecution established a timeline linking Family Court appearances concerning the parties' children with defendant's search for cyanide, developments in defendant's assault case with his procurement of cyanide, defendant's conversation with his mother about her visit to his wife in the hospital with defendant's first disguised entrance into the hospital, and defendant's upcoming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Huntley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing in the assault case with his having committed the murder. Viewed in the light most favorable to the People, the timeline theory established a legally sufficient case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Capital Murder -- Witness Elimination -- Verdict against Weight of Evidence</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. Defendant's first degree murder conviction based on witness elimination under Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (v) for poisoning his wife while she was in the hospital recovering from serious injuries he had inflicted upon her six months earlier was against the weight of the evidence and must be vacated. Although the prosecution established a legally sufficient case with a timeline theory linking certain developments in defendant's assault prosecution with his having committed the murder, the weight of the evidence at trial did not support witness elimination as a substantial motive for the murder. Rather, it led to the conclusion that defendant wanted to kill his wife for reasons that had virtually nothing to do with her ability to testify against him.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. Defendant's conviction under Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii) for committing first degree murder in the course and in furtherance of second degree burglary by sneaking into his wife's hospital room and poisoning her while she was recovering from serious injuries he had previously inflicted upon her must be vacated, as defendant did not have a felonious intent independent of the murder itself. Defendant's trespass on the hospital premises was merely a prerequisite to his committing the murder--an enabling measure that had no purpose or substance other than to serve his only goal, to kill his victim. Burglary requires an intent to commit a crime in the burglarized premises, and here the prosecutor used defendant's intent to kill his wife to both satisfy the burglary definition and elevate defendant's intentional murder to first degree murder. In order to be eligible for the death penalty, a burglar must have entered the building with the intent to commit a separate crime, such as steal, rob, or rape, and in addition have killed someone intentionally, in the course and in furtherance of the burglary. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the New York State Tax Appeals Tribunal held that interest income which corporate taxpayers received from second-tier subsidiaries was deductible in certain cases, a bank holding company filed a claim with the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, seeking a tax refund. The state agreed to cancel notices of deficiencies it issued against the company, and the company reported the state's decision to the New York City Department of Finance and filed a claim, pursuant to New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 11-646(e), seeking a refund of taxes it paid to the city. The Department of Finance denied the claim, and the company filed an action seeking a judgment declaring that it was entitled to the refund. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the company, but the appellate court reversed that judgment. The state high court held that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 11-681(2) required the company to appeal the Department's decision to the New York City Tax Appeals Tribunal before it filed suit against the Department, and because the company failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, the courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the company's lawsuit.</SPAN></P>

The statute pursuant to which plaintiff sought forfeiture of defendant's vehicle, Nassau County Administrative Code &sect; 8-7.0 (g) (3), failed to provide for such hearings. In the context of lawful arrests for driving while intoxicated, immediate seizure of the vehicle is warranted, but a prompt post-seizure hearing must be held. At that hearing the County must establish that probable cause existed for the defendant's initial warrantless arrest, that it is likely to succeed on the merits of the forfeiture action, and that retention is necessary to preserve the vehicle from destruction or sale during the pendency of the proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After paying consulting costs and the town's fixed, per-lot recreation fee in lieu of dedicating a portion of property for recreational purposes &quot;under protest,&quot; the developer claimed that the requirements equated to a taking and violated due process. On appeal, the court upheld the fee provisions. The developer failed to establish that the per-lot fee constituted a taking because when enacting the current fees, the town made explicit findings that the demand for recreational facilities exceeded existing resources and that continued subdivision development, paired with upward-spiraling land costs, would have exacerbated the problem. Additionally, the statute authorizing the town to impose recreation fees mandated that fees collected in lieu of parkland set-asides were to be deposited into a trust fund to be used strictly for recreational purposes. Thus, the essential nexus between the stated purpose of the condition and the fee per N.Y. Town Law &sect; 277(4)(c) was met. The fee was roughly proportional to the impact the development would have had on the town's recreational needs.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The requirement of Monroe Town Code &sect; 26B-2 (A) (7) that certain subdivision applicants pay a set fee per subdivision lot in lieu of dedicating a portion of their property for recreational purposes did not equate to an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;US Const 5th Amend) with respect to plaintiff's residential subdivision project. When enacting the current fees, defendant Town made explicit findings that the demand for recreational facilities exceeded existing resources and that continued subdivision development, paired with the increasing cost of land, would exacerbate the problem. The fees were required to be deposited into a trust fund used strictly for recreational purposes (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Town Law &sect; 277 [4] [c]). An essential nexus existed between the stated purpose of the condition and the fee. Moreover, defendant's findings regarding plaintiff's subdivision application reflected an individualized consideration of the proposed subdivision's impact, and satisfied Town Law &sect; 277 (4) (c) requirements for determining whether parkland dedication is appropriate.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff developer's due process rights were not violated by the imposition of per-lot recreation fees in connection with its residential subdivision project under Monroe Town Code &sect; 26B-2 (A) (7) without a hearing to review the reasonableness of the fee amount. The Town Code provision requires that certain subdivision applicants pay a set fee per subdivision lot in lieu of dedicating a portion of their property for recreational purposes. The per-lot fee was neither a special assessment nor a tax, but rather was generally applicable to any property owner seeking to divide his or her property. Defendant adopted the local law through a legislative process, and revisited the fee schedule on a yearly basis, at which time concerned property owners could voice objections.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The requirement of Monroe Town Code &sect; 26B-2 (A) (11) (a) that certain subdivision applicants pay the consulting fees incurred by defendant Town in processing their residential subdivision applications did not violate due process in connection with plaintiff developer's application on the ground that no opportunity existed to challenge the reasonableness of the fees. Under the Town Code provision, applicants are required to reimburse defendant only for fees actually expended. The Code provision expressly limits the fees to those that are reasonable, and defendant interprets the fees as subject to the audit provisions of Town Law &sect;&sect; 118 and 119. Moreover, plaintiff did not allege that the fees were, in fact, unreasonable. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a medical society and others (the challengers), appealed from an affirmance, by the Supreme Court, Appellate Division (New York), of a trial court decision upholding the validity of revisions to no-fault insurance regulations, codified at N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 11, pt. 65, promulgated by respondents, New York State's Superintendent of Insurance and his agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New York's Insurance Law established a no-fault system, and authorized the promulgation of regulations to effect a system that would ensure prompt compensation for losses, reduce burdens on courts, and result in lowered insurance premiums. When the agency determined that rampant insurance fraud was driving up premiums, the Superintendent revised certain regulations, changing certain time limits for submitting expense claims and requiring the insurance companies themselves to develop standards for dealing with late-filed claims to assure fairness to injured persons. The high court held that all these changes fell within the constitutional and statutory delegations of authority to the Superintendent, who was entitled to fill in the gaps left blank by the legislature, and that they had been properly adopted. The challengers also argued that the standards developed by companies constituted administrative rules in themselves, that should have been adopted in accordance with New York's State Administrative Procedure Act. The high court found that the standards in question were simply guidelines applied on a case-by-case basis, and were not true rules.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law -- Rule Making -- Separation of Powers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The broad grant of regulatory power contained in Insurance Law &sect; 301, pursuant to which the Superintendent of Insurance is given power to make regulations interpreting the provisions of the Insurance Law, does not cede to the executive branch fundamental legislative or policymaking authority. Thus, section 301 does not violate the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law -- Rule Making -- Scope of Authority </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The Superintendent of Insurance did not exceed the scope of his constitutional authority by engaging in inherently legislative activity in promulgating revised regulations reducing the time frames for claiming and proving entitlement to no-fault automobile insurance benefits.  The regulations were not promulgated on a blank slate without any legislative guidance, nor did the revised regulations effectuate a profound change in social and economic policy.  The Superintendent prescribed rules and regulations consistent with the enabling legislation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law -- Rule Making -- Scope of Authority </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The absence of a specific statutory delegation of authority to establish time frames does not bar the Superintendent of Insurance from promulgating revised regulations that reduce the time frames for claiming and proving entitlement to no-fault automobile insurance benefits.  The Legislature's failure to enact time limits evinces a legislative preference to yield to administrative expertise in filling in an interstice in the statutory scheme by the setting of such limits.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law -- Rule Making -- Scope of Authority </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Insofar as revised regulations reducing the time frames for claiming and proving entitlement to no-fault automobile insurance benefits create not a new category of exclusion, but rather merely a condition precedent with which all claimants must comply in order to receive benefits under the no-fault statute, the reduced time limits do not unlawfully create a new class of exclusion from coverage.  The expert judgment of the Superintendent of Insurance that the reduced time frames will not have the effect of excluding a significant number of legitimate claims is not to be second-guessed by the courts, and his determination that the revised regulations are the most effective means of advancing the legislative intent of providing prompt payment of benefits as the loss is incurred, while reducing rampant abuse, was neither irrational nor unreasonable, nor arbitrary or capricious.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law -- Rule Making -- Filing with Department of State </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5.

Since these standards encompass case-specific mitigating factors and vest the decisionmakers with significant discretion with which to independently exercise their professional judgment, the standards constitute not &quot;rules&quot; but guidelines, and such guidelines need not be filed with the Department of State pursuant to NY Constitution, article IV, &sect; 8, which mandates that agency regulations be filed with the Department of State prior to becoming effective.  </SPAN></P>

Self-regulation by private parties is not forbidden, as long as the delegation of authority is properly circumscribed by agency oversight.  Here, the challenged regulations provide that insurer standards will come under review by the Insurance Department, the actual rulemaking authority.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7.

Accordingly, petitioners' contentions that respondents failed to analyze alternative approaches raised in public comments, failed to supply an adequate Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) that described the &quot;needs and benefits&quot; of the revised regulations, failed to amend the RIS and RFA, and failed to provide a &quot;best estimate&quot; of the costs of the proposed regulations, are rejected.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10. In promulgating revised regulations which no longer permit the assignment to health care providers of no-fault insurance benefits for non-health-related services (11 NYCRR 65-3.11 [a]), the Superintendent of Insurance rationally and reasonably determined that the restriction is necessary to reduce abuses in the payment of benefits for such services, particularly with respect to questionable claims for transportation or housekeeping expenses, and that permitting assignment of such claims thus contravenes public policy. </SPAN></P>

Revised regulations providing that arbitrators may issue subpoenas on their own initiative, and &quot;may raise any issue that the arbitrator deems relevant to making an award that is consistent with the Insurance Law and department regulations&quot; (11 NYCRR 65-4.4 [e]) do not undermine Insurance Law &sect; 5106 (b).  The statute states that &quot;[e]very insurer shall provide a claimant with the option of submitting any dispute involving the insurer's liability to pay * * * benefits * * * the amount thereof or any other matter which may arise [with respect to overdue benefits] * * * to arbitration pursuant to simplified procedures to be promulgated or approved by the superintendent.&quot; The statute requires only that insurers provide claimants with the option of arbitration.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Appellate Term (New York), which affirmed defendant's conviction for two counts of fourth-degree stalking in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 120.45.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that the legislature's failure to define the statutory words &quot;no legitimate purpose&quot; rendered the anti-stalking statute unconstitutionally vague and that the vagueness problem was exacerbated because the statute did not contain a specific intent requirement. The court disagreed and upheld his conviction. The statute did contain a mens rea requirement of intent; before a person could be convicted, he must have intended to engage in a course of conduct targeted at a specific person. The legislature's decision to require intent as to a particular course of conduct--as opposed to a specific result of fear or harm--was purposeful; the law focused on what the offenders did, not what they meant by it or intended, as trying to discern the specific motivations of stalkers, many of whom were emotionally disturbed, would prove difficult. The ordinary understanding of the phrase &quot;no legitimate purpose,&quot; namely, the absence of a reason or justification, when read in conjunction with the other statutory provisions, gave defendant adequate notice that his unrelenting pursuit of the complainant was unlawful, particularly after she told him she wanted no contact with him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Statute -- Stalking Statute Not Void for Vagueness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 120.45 (1) and (2), which provides that a person is guilty of stalking in the fourth degree if he or she &quot;intentionally, and for no legitimate purpose,&quot; engages in a course of conduct directed at a specific person when the offender knows or reasonably should know that the offender's conduct either is likely to place the victim in reasonable fear of material harm, or causes material harm where such conduct consists of certain actions done after the offender was clearly told to stop, is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's conduct, and accordingly is not invalid on its face.  Defendant approached the complainant and gave her unsolicited gifts on two occasions, and then, despite being told that she did not want any further contact with him, defendant followed the complainant to various locations almost every day during a five-week period.  While the statute does not require that the offender intend a specific result, such as fear or harm, the offender must have intended to engage in a course of conduct targeted at a specific person. Defendant could not reasonably have failed to realize that his intentional course of conduct directed at the complainant was unlawful.  Nor does the phrase &quot;no legitimate purpose&quot; render the statute unconstitutionally vague, as it is commonly understood to mean the absence of a reason or justification to engage someone, other than to hound, frighten, intimidate, or threaten.  Defendant has offered no explanation for having inflicted himself on complainant, nor has he attempted to show that his intrusive behavior involved some valid purpose other than hounding her to the point of harm.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While serving parole for a 1994 conviction for two offenses, the felon was directed to submit a DNA sample pursuant to a 1999 amendment of N.Y.

He argued that application of the law to his case violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, as well as the caveat of N.Y. Gen. Constr. Law &sect; 93 that ambiguous statutes should not be construed so as to exact a retroactive punishment. The court rejected both arguments. The felon's ex-post-facto argument failed because the DNA identification index was to be used in future investigations, not as a punishment for past crimes. There was no indication that the extraction of DNA samples was required as a way of increasing the punishment of persons convicted of the designated offenses. The felon's second argument failed because the General Construction Law placed no restraint on the state legislature beyond the restrictions in the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. XI, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that various State policies, including school residency requirements and nonresident tuition requirements, had resulted in high levels of poverty and racial isolation, which in turn had led to deficient student performance. The appellate division granted the State's motion to dismiss. The court affirmed. Plaintiffs had failed to state a cause of action under the Education Article. Plaintiffs had not claimed that the substandard academic performance in their schools stemmed from a lack of funds or inadequacy in the teaching, facilities, or instrumentalities of learning. Rather, they premised their argument on the State's failure to mitigate demographic factors that might affect student performance. However, allegations of academic failure alone, without allegations that the State had failed in its obligation to provide minimally acceptable educational services, were insufficient to state a cause of action. To embrace plaintiffs' theory that the State was responsible for the demographic makeup of every school district would subvert the important role of local control and participation in education and would make the State responsible for where people chose to live.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a class action brought on behalf of students in the Rochester City School District, plaintiffs' allegations that certain state practices and policies have resulted in high concentrations of racial minorities and poverty in the school district, leading to abysmal student performance, are insufficient to state a cause of action under the Education Article of the New York Constitution (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 1).  Plaintiffs do not allege that the substandard academic performance in their schools is caused by any deficiency in teaching, facilities or instrumentalities of learning, or any lack of funding. The Education Article provides children with the right to a &quot;sound basic education,&quot; and if the State puts adequate resources into the classroom, it satisfies its constitutional promise even if student performance remains substandard. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the State had violated art. XI, &sect; 1 and Title VI, provided a template for a sound basic education, and directed the State to put in place systematic reforms. The appellate division reversed. The court affirmed to the extent that plaintiffs' Title VI claims were dismissed and otherwise reversed. Plaintiffs had established a prima facie case of showing a causal link between the funding of New York City schools and students' educational opportunities. Tens of thousands of students were placed in overcrowded classrooms, taught by unqualified teachers, and provided with inadequate facilities and equipment. Test results and the number of students finishing school also showed that students were not receiving a sound basic education. The court modified the trial court's threshold guideline that the State ascertain the actual costs of providing a sound basic education in districts around the State and held instead that the State need only ascertain the actual cost of providing a sound basic education in New York City. Reforms to the current funding system had to ensure that every city school would have the resources necessary to provide a sound basic education.</SPAN></P>

The quality of New York City teachers is inadequate, New York City schools have excessive class sizes which negatively affect learning, New York City schools are deficient in instrumentalities of learning, and the rate of school completion in New York City compares unfavorably with both state and national figures.  Plaintiffs have established the necessary &quot;causal link&quot; between the present funding system and the poor performance of City schools by showing that increased funding can provide better teachers, facilities and instrumentalities of learning, and that such improved inputs yield better student performance.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools -- State Aid to School Districts -- Remedy for Failure to Provide Sound Basic Education </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. With respect to New York City's public schoolchildren, the State has violated the constitutional mandate to provide all the children of the state with a sound basic education (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 1).  To remedy the State's violation of the constitutional mandate, defendants must determine the actual cost of providing a sound basic education in New York City and enact appropriate reforms which ensure a system of accountability.  The State should be able to build on existing criteria to identify the schools in greatest need and set measurable goals for their improvement.  Because City schools are dependent on municipal revenues, it will not be mandated that a new system must ensure the City &quot;sustained and stable funding.&quot; Reforms may address governance as well as the school funding system, and state aid should increase where need is high and local ability to pay is low.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, citizens and legislators opposed to casino gambling (citizens), alleged that an agreement and its later amendment between defendant governor and an Indian tribe violated the separation of powers and the constitutional ban on gambling. Following a remand, the trial court granted the citizens' motion for summary judgment. That judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court, Appellate Division (New York), from which the governor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the trial court decision, the interim court held that the governor's unilateral action deprived the legislature of its authority in such areas as the location of the casino, the gaming that could be carried on there, the extent of state involvement in providing regulation, and the fees to be exacted. The governor contested standing as to all of the citizen groups. The appellate court found that, because it concluded that the citizen taxpayers had standing, it was not necessary to address the governor's challenge as to the other citizens. Here, the citizen-taxpayers sufficiently alleged a challenge to the expenditure of state money to withstand the governor's motion to dismiss for lack of standing. The appellate court found further that the citizens' declaratory judgment action fell within the residuary six-year statute of limitations period under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 213(1). Nowhere, however, was there any indication that the delay in bringing the action caused the slightest harm to the tribe. The appellate court found, finally, that the alleged constitutional violation would have been without remedy if the action was dismissed for the tribe's nonjoinder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was modified by vacating that portion pertaining to the 1999 amendment to the original agreement as void and unenforceable and, as so modified, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal -- Academic and Moot Questions -- Action Challenging Authority of Governor to Enter into Casino Gambling Compact with Indian Tribe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In two actions challenging the authority of the Governor to enter into a casino gambling compact with an Indian tribe in 1993 and a one-year amendment to the compact in 1999 without legislative approval, the portion of plaintiffs' suit that challenges the validity of the 1999 amendment is moot. The amendment expired in May 2000, and in the intervening three years no similar agreement has gone into effect.  A declaration as to the validity or invalidity of the 1999 amendment would therefore have no practical effect on the parties.  The portion of plaintiffs' suit that challenges the validity of the 1993 compact, however, is not moot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties -- Standing -- Taxpayer's Action Challenging Authority of Governor to Enter into Casino Gambling Compact with Indian Tribe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff citizen taxpayers have standing under State Finance Law &sect; 123-b to maintain actions challenging the authority of the Governor to enter into a casino gambling compact with an Indian tribe without legislative approval.  Plaintiffs challenge as unconstitutional the expenditure of state funds and the use of state regulatory personnel for the casino, claims that have a sufficient nexus to fiscal activities of the state to allow for standing under section 123-b.  If plaintiffs were denied standing, an important constitutional issue would be effectively insulated from judicial review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitation of Actions -- Six-Year Statute of Limitations -- Action Challenging Authority of Governor to Enter into Casino Gambling Compact with Indian Tribe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Two actions challenging the authority of the Governor to enter into a casino gambling compact with an Indian tribe without legislative approval are not barred by the statute of limitations. Plaintiffs seek a declaration as to the unconstitutionality of the compact and an injunction against the use of state funds to implement it.  That relief cannot be afforded under CPLR article 78, and the four-month limitations period (CPLR 217) for article 78 actions does not apply.  Rather, plaintiffs' declaratory judgment actions fall within the residuary six-year statute of limitations period under CPLR 213 (1).  The actions are timely, having been brought less than six years after the compact was published in the Federal Register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equity -- Laches -- Action Challenging Authority of Governor to Enter into Casino Gambling Compact with Indian Tribe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Two actions challenging the authority of the Governor to enter into a casino gambling compact with an Indian tribe without legislative approval brought nearly six years after the compact became final are not barred by laches. There has been no economic prejudice to the tribe, which has been operating, and presumably profiting from, the casino during the entire pendency of the suit.  While the suit threatens future casino revenue, the prejudice caused by a loss of expected profits based on a predictably vulnerable compact is not the sort of prejudice that supports a defense of laches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties -- Necessary Parties -- Failure to Join Indian Tribe in Actions to Invalidate Tribe's Casino Gambling Compact</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Two actions challenging the authority of the Governor to enter into a casino gambling compact with an Indian tribe without legislative approval should not be dismissed for failure to join the tribe as an indispensable party (CPLR 1001).  The tribe has chosen not to participate, and it cannot be forced to participate because it has sovereign immunity. Plaintiffs do not have another remedy available to them (CPLR 1001 [b] [1]), and no one would ever be able to bring this constitutional challenge should it be determined that the tribe is an indispensable party. To the extent that the tribe is prejudiced by the adjudication of issues that affect its rights under the compact, it could have mitigated that prejudice by participating in the suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law -- Separation of Powers -- Governor's Execution of Casino Gambling Compact with Indian Tribe without Legislative Approval</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. The Governor lacks authority to bind the State to a casino gambling compact with an Indian tribe without legislative approval.  The Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act does not preempt state law governing which state actors are competent to negotiate and agree to gaming compacts, but it contemplates that states will confront several policy choices when negotiating gaming compacts (25 USC &sect; 2710 [d] [3] [C]).  These policy choices require a balancing of different interests, a task that the multi-member, representative Legislature is entrusted to perform under New York's constitutional structure.  Moreover, the compact required the State Racing and Wagering Board to adopt new regulations for the oversight of casino gambling, which the agency cannot do without legislative authorization.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff residential health care facility (RHCF) sued respondent Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, seeking a declaration that assessments imposed under N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2807-d were unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the action but the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) reversed the trial court's judgment in part. The instant court granted leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New York State enacted N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2807-d in 1990 to raise revenue to overcome a budget and Medicaid deficit. Section 2807-d required RHCFs to pay 0.6 percent of their gross receipts from patient care services and operating income to the State, and was amended in 1992, by imposing an additional assessment of 1.2 percent. The amended statute exempted two categories of nonprofit RHCFs from the assessments but did not extend that exemption to a not-for-profit RHCF that operated a home of needy, aged women, and the RHCF filed an action claiming that &sect; 2807-d was unconstitutional as applied to it. The trial court directed the RHCF to comply with the reporting requirements of &sect; 2807-d and dismissed its action challenging assessments that were imposed under it, but the intermediate appellate court found that the additional assessment of 1.2 percent was arbitrary in that it imposed a tax exclusively on the RHCF, and it modified the trial court's judgment. The instant court held that &sect; 2807-d was constitutional in all respects and the intermediate appellate court erred by finding that the additional assessment denied the RHCF equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court declared that the statute was constitutional, directed the RHCF to comply with its reporting requirements, and remitted the case to the trial court for further consideration of the Department's counterclaim for an order determining the amounts which the RHCF owned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Statute -- Statute Imposing Assessment on Gross Receipts of Certain Health-Related Facilities </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Health Law &sect; 2807-d (2) (b) (i), which requires residential health care facilities (RHCFs) to pay a monetary assessment of 0.6% of gross receipts, and Public Health Law &sect; 2807-d (2) (b) (ii), which imposes an additional 1.2%, are constitutionally valid and are not violative of plaintiff's right to equal protection of the law.  The statute exempts two new categories of nonprofit RHCFs from the assessments, neither of which includes plaintiff.  For purposes of equal protection review, any classification creating differential taxation enjoys a strong presumption of constitutionality.  A classification must be upheld if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification. Here, the policy-based exemptions and the tax itself are rationally imposed by the statute.  The plain language of Public Health Law &sect; 2807-d and its legislative history demonstrate a clear intention by the Legislature that the section apply to all RHCFs, as defined by article 28, absent a specific exemption, including plaintiff, a non-Medicaid, not-for-profit RHCF that does not fit within any exemption. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In respondent injured party's medical malpractice action, the trial court structured a future damages judgment under N.Y.

The hospital and insurer sought further review, and the Appellate Division certified a question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court rejected the hospital's and insurer's proposed structure for paying the injured party future damages he was awarded and adopted the injured party's proposed structure. The court of appeals held N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5031(e) was very specific regarding the procedure for structuring an annuity for the payment of future damages. The first annual payment was to be calculated by dividing the amount of future damages, after certain adjustments, by the number of years over which payment was to be made, and each succeeding year's payment was computed by adding four percent to the previous year's payment. The potential dramatic discrepancy between the jury's award and the injured party's ultimate recovery, if he survived the number of years the future damages award was intended to cover, did not allow the court to ignore the statute's clear language. Had the legislature intended that the structured judgment bear a more direct relationship to the jury's award, it could have required the jury's itemization of damages on a per-year basis or itemization of a specific inflation rate. The statute did not authorize the approach proposed by the hospital and insurer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damages - Structured Judgment - Discrepancy between Jury Award and Ultimate Recovery </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Literal application of CPLR article 50-A is not prohibited when the resulting structured judgment might exceed the jury's future damages award. CPLR 5031 (e) is clear that the first year payout under the annuity for future damages is to be determined &quot;by dividing the remaining amount of future damages by the number of years over which such payments shall be made,&quot; and that the payment for each successive year is to be computed by &quot;adding four percent to the previous year's payment.&quot; CPLR 4111 (d) requires only that juries itemize their verdicts with a category of damages, a total dollar amount and a term of years.  Juries will not be asked to itemize the basis for their verdict in terms of inflation rates, productivity rates and other factors assumed in reaching a total amount of damages, and to thereby render superfluous the information required under CPLR 4111 (d).  In determining a growth rate for the structured judgment, CPLR 5031 (e) does not authorize applying a rate that will increase payments in such a way as to equal the jury's future damages award in the specified number of years.  Such a methodology disregards the additional four percent adjustment on structured judgments specifically delineated in the statute.  Further, the phrase &quot;determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices&quot; in CPLR 5031 (e) refers to selection of the discount rate used to reduce the structured judgment to present value. It does not empower courts to review and rewrite the entirety of a structured judgment to conform to economic doctrines.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A towing company and two companies that operated tug boats on New York's waterways challenged the constitutionality of New York's taxing scheme that taxed petroleum consumption. The applicable tax was assessed for the privilege of using the state's waterways. After the trial court found that the statutes were facially unconstitutional, the interim court reversed. The commissioner sought to resolve any questions, and appealed as a matter of right. The appellate court found that the applicable decisions supported the appellate court's conclusion that the Complete Auto test was the appropriate test to determine whether the tax statutes violated the Commerce Clause. Further, consistent with the appellate court's decision in Orvis, they supported the conclusion that physical presence of a business in New York was sufficient to constitute a &quot;substantial nexus&quot; with the state under Complete Auto.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Tax Law &sect; 301 (a) (1) (ii) and &sect; 301-a (b) (2); (c) (1) (B), which impose a tax on petroleum businesses for the privilege of doing business in New York measured by fuel consumption on vessels engaged in interstate commerce while operating in New York State waters, are not facially unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause.

The required nexus need not necessarily be directly related to the activity being taxed, but can simply be whether there is some definite link, some minimum connection, between the taxing state and the person it seeks to tax.  Physical presence of a business in New York is sufficient to constitute a &quot;substantial nexus,&quot; and the fact that the tax is measured by the consumption of fuel within New York does not alter the State's authority to tax the privilege of doing business in New York. Accordingly, the facial constitutional challenge must fail because there is a set of circumstances under which the statute would be valid: the entity being taxed may be a New York corporation with offices in the state, employing New York citizens and conducting business in the state.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant child support agency sought to increase a child support order pursuant to child support guidelines, under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency said N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 413-a allowed the trial court to adjust the child support order based on the child support guidelines in N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 413, but respondent father said this would be a de facto modification without showing a change in circumstances. The court of appeals held the plain language and legislative history of N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 413-a directed the trial court to review the order to determine if an adjustment was warranted based on the child support guidelines, and not merely whether a cost of living adjustment should be applied. This adjustment was distinct from a modification based on a change in circumstances, so the parties' right to seek modification was not impermissibly expanded. This interpretation of the statute did not create an impediment to the father's right to contract with the mother, contrary to U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, and it served the important public purpose of ensuring that children received adequate support. The statute gave the father adequate notice of the possibility that the order could be adjusted in accordance with the child support guidelines, so the father's due process rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a proceeding to review an objection to a cost of living adjustment (COLA) to a child support order, section 413-a of the Family Court Act authorizes the Family Court to review and adjust the underlying child support order in accordance with the standards set forth in Family Court Act &sect; 413, not merely to decide if a COLA should be applied.  Under the plain language of section 413-a, when a hearing is held pursuant to a COLA objection, the court is to review the order to determine whether an adjustment is warranted based on the section 413 guidelines. The statute directs the court to issue either &quot;a new order of support in accordance with the child support standards&quot; or, &quot;where application of the child support standards ... results in a determination that no adjustment is appropriate,&quot; to enter an order of no adjustment.  An order &quot;in accordance with the child support standards&quot; should be exactly that: an order that comports with the guidelines as set forth in section 413.  Moreover, allowing de novo review of an underlying support order does not improperly expand the right to modification of support orders, since the right to review is distinct from the right to seek modification. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Support - Cost of Living Adjustment - Constitutionality of De Novo Review of Child Support Obligation upon Filing Objections </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. De novo review and adjustment of a child support order under Family Court Act &sect; 413-a in a proceeding to review a cost of living adjustment to that order does not violate the Contract Clause of the Federal Constitution.  There is no impediment to the parties' right to contract. Moreover, even a substantial impairment of the right to contract is not unconstitutional if the State can demonstrate that it is reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose.  Ensuring that children receive adequate support is an important public purpose, and review of support orders is a reasonable and necessary means of accomplishing that goal.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Support - Cost of Living Adjustment - Due Process </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The objection process of Family Court Act &sect; 413-a, which authorizes the Family Court to review de novo and adjust an underlying child support order in a proceeding to review an objection to a cost of living adjustment to that order, satisfies due process requirements.  Section 413-a notifies the parties that there will be a hearing in the event of an objection, and indicates what will be reviewed at the hearing and the possible outcomes.  In addition, section 413-a does not require &quot;specific written objections.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner City Council appealed from the dismissal of its petition by the Appellate Division (New York), seeking to annul two orders of respondent New York Public Service Commission (PSC) approving the renewal of franchises of respondent cable companies, negotiated by respondent information technology department, and approved by respondent New York City Franchise and Concession Review Committee (FCRC) and respondent former Mayor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Council sought to annul the PSC's orders and to direct the city respondents to submit the franchise agreements to the Council for review and approval. The appellate court held that the PSC rationally concluded that for purposes of N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 591.3(c), the FCRC had the authority to approve franchise renewals. The regulation did not require the additional approval of the Council. The Council's argument that the City Charter precluded Council involvement in selection but not renewal of franchise agreements was rejected. The absence of an express prohibition on the Council's authority to approve renewals did not amount to an affirmative grant of power. The Charter gave the FCRC the authority to approve franchise agreements. The decision to approve the renewal of a franchise agreement necessarily involved selection of a franchise. The PSC rationally read the Charter to limit the power of the Council as to franchise renewals. The Charter contained the same limitation in connection with the renewal process. Therefore, the PSC correctly concluded that the FCRC was the &quot;local legislative body&quot; whose assent was required by state regulation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law - Administrative Interpretation - Deference to Agency Interpretation - Public Service Commission </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a proceeding to annul determinations of the Public Service Commission renewing certain cable television franchises in New York City, deference is due the orders of the Commission.  Petitioner's challenge to the orders relies solely on the requirement of &quot;local legislative approval&quot; set forth in 9 NYCRR 591.3 (c).  The interpretation given to a regulation by the agency which promulgated it and is responsible for its administration is entitled to deference if that determination is not irrational or unreasonable.  The Commission's predecessor promulgated the regulation and the Commission is responsible for ensuring compliance with its requirements.  The Commission, in applying its regulation, relied not only on the statute but also on its own past practices with respect to New York City cable franchises. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio and Television - Cable Television - Franchise - Local Legislative Approval of Renewal - New York City Council </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In renewing certain cable television franchises in New York City, the Public Service Commission rationally concluded that &quot;local legislative body&quot; in 9 NYCRR 591.3 (c) meant the body designated to approve franchise renewals. The authorizing statute for section 591.3 (c)--Public Service Law &sect; 222 (1)--speaks of &quot;any municipal approval required ... by law.&quot; Although in municipalities other than New York City, franchises are granted by the town board, village board of trustees, or the common council of the city, the New York City Charter requires that the Franchise and Concession Review Committee approve franchises, and explicitly bars any participation by the New York City Council after the Council passes an authorizing resolution. Thus, the Commission rationally concluded that for purposes of 9 NYCRR 591.3 (c), the Review Committee was the body with authority to approve franchise renewals, and that its regulation did not require or authorize the additional approval of the Council.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio and Television - Cable Television - Franchise - Local Legislative Approval of Renewal - New York City Council </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In renewing certain cable television franchises in New York City, the Public Service Commission rationally read the New York City Charter to limit the power of the New York City Council with respect to franchise renewals. The Charter gives the Franchise and Concession Review Committee the authority to approve franchise agreements.  The absence of an express prohibition on the Council's authority to approve renewals does not amount to an affirmative grant of power.  The Charter gives the Council the power to pass an authorizing resolution, but also limits its authority by providing that the Council may not use an authorizing resolution to involve itself in the selection of a franchise. The decision to approve renewal of a franchise agreement necessarily involves selection of a franchise. Accordingly, inasmuch as the charter contains the same limitation in connection with the renewal process, the Commission correctly concluded that the Review Committee was the local legislative body whose assent is required by state regulation to renew a franchise. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held defendant's motion seeking dismissal based on the unconstitutionality of the statute he was charged with violating had to be filed within 45 days after arraignment and before the commencement of trial, or within such additional time as the trial court granted, under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 255.20. It was the legislature's intention that such a potentially dispositive motion be made at the outset of a prosecution and not delayed until after an unfavorable verdict. Because defendant's challenge to the statute's constitutionality was not raised until he filed a motion to set aside the verdict, under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.30, his challenge was not properly preserved. When the Appellate Division decided the constitutional issue on the merits without addressing the lack of preservation, its reversal was based on an unpreserved issue and an appeal of its decision to the court of appeals did not meet the jurisdictional requirements of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 450.90(2)(a). Therefore, dismissal of defendant's appeal was required.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Appeal - Matters Appealable - Constitutional Challenge to Penal Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An appeal from an Appellate Division order which reversed an order granting defendant's motion pursuant to CPL 330.30 (1) to vacate a loitering conviction on the ground that Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (2) is unconstitutional, and reinstated the verdict, is dismissed.  A defendant may move to seek dismissal of an indictment based on the unconstitutionality of the statute defining the offense charged (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 210.20 [1] [a]; 210.25 [3]) within specific time periods established by the Criminal Procedure Law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 210.20 [2]; 255.20 [1]).  A trial court is afforded discretion to entertain a dismissal motion &quot;in the interest of justice, and for good cause shown&quot; at any time before sentence (CPL 255.20 [3]).  These deadlines rest on the strong public policy to further orderly trial procedures and preserve scarce trial resources.  Defendant's constitutional challenge, made for the first time on a CPL 330.30 motion, was not preserved. The Appellate Division decided the constitutional issue on the merits without addressing the lack of preservation. Since the reversal was based on an unpreserved issue, it does not satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of CPL 450.90 (2) (a).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner party members filed a complaint with their political party's county committee to cancel respondent state senator's enrollment in their party. The committee's chair expelled the senator from the party. The trial court then ordered the board of elections to cancel the senator's enrollment pursuant to N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 16-110(2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The senator's expulsion from the party was sought after he announced his intention to change his party affiliation and join the opposing party. The senator ultimately deferred his enrollment in the opposing party, however, because of a delay in the change taking effect; he opted to run in his current party's primary and to enroll in the opposing party later. Upon a party member's written complaint, &sect; 16-110(2) allowed the county committee's chair to determine that a voter enrolled in the party was not in sympathy with the party's principles, and required the trial court to direct cancellation of the voter's enrollment if it appeared that the chair's determination was just. The court of appeals agreed with the appellate division that evidence privileged under the speech and debate clause, N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 11, was improperly considered by the committee's chair. However, other statements and conduct not protected by N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 11 were also offered. Since it was unclear what the committee chair would have decided on a record purged of the privileged information, a remand was required for the committee's chair to redetermine the issue using only proper evidence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Election Law &sect; 16-110 (2), which permits the cancellation of the enrollment of a member of a political party after a finding that the party enrollee is not in sympathy with party principles, is not limited to the prevention of &quot;raids&quot; on political parties.

A finding by a political party's county committee that a State Senator, who had announced his intention to switch to another party, was no longer in sympathy with the principles of the party in which he is still enrolled (Election Law &sect; 16-110 [2]), may not be based on conduct which is protected by the Speech or Debate Clause of the State Constitution (NY Const, art III, &sect; 11).  The Senator's participation in the rival party's Senate Conference activities, his voting record on legislation, the change in his seating in the Senate Chamber, and other legislative conduct are privileged and may not be considered in determining the Senator's political sympathies. Accordingly, to the extent that the Senator's expulsion from his party was based on constitutionally protected acts, it may not stand.  </SPAN></P>

In determining if a State Senator, who had announced his intention to switch his allegiance to a rival political party, may be expelled from his political party pursuant to Election Law &sect; 16-110 (2) on the ground that he is no longer in sympathy with his party's principles, certain conduct by the Senator, which was not protected by the Speech or Debate Clause (NY Const, art III, &sect; 11), may be considered sufficient to justify expulsion. The record contains evidence, from several public sources, of repeated and consistently maintained statements in which the Senator denounced his party.  It may not be assumed that the proper finder of fact would or should accord the greatest weight to the Senator's choice ultimately not to change his party enrollment. Since the proper finder of fact to make that determination is the County Committee Chair, which must not base its findings on evidence that relates solely to the Senator's legislative acts or participation in the Senate Conference of a rival party, the matter must be remitted to that body for a redetermination upon proper evidence.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1978, the city leased lot 70, as well as six other nearby parcels, to the property corporation under a master lease for a term of 90 years, including renewal options, pursuant to an urban renewal plan. In 1987, lot 70 was severed from the master lease, and made subject to a severance lease with a similar term. SCA condemned lot 70 in order to construct an elementary/intermediate school on the site. The corporation argued that SCA lacked the statutory authority to condemn lot 70; that as expressed by the legislature, use for urban renewal was superior to use as a public school; and that it had a state constitutional right to develop lot 70. The appellate court found that the written notice sent by SCA to the mayor effectively complied with N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1728(6). Further, the prior public use doctrine did not bar the condemnation of the property. SCA sought to condemn the property in order to provide schools to relieve severe overcrowding in two districts. As SCA has complied with the appropriate statutory procedures, it was authorized to condemn the property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The New York City School Construction Authority does not lack the statutory authority to condemn a leasehold interest in real property owned by the City of New York.  Although Public Authorities Law &sect; 1728 (6) confers on the Authority broad condemnation powers, the condemnation of City property, or property in which the City has an interest, must comply with section 1729 (2), under which the Authority must submit a written request for the property directly to the mayor.  The Authority may condemn the property under section 1728 (6) if the mayor does not respond to the request within 30 days.  Accordingly, the Authority effectively complied with section 1728 (6) by sending written notice to the mayor of its intention to use the leasehold through the submission of a site plan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eminent Domain - Public Use - Prior Public Use Doctrine - Condemnation by School Construction Authority of Property Designated for Urban Renewal </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The prior public use doctrine does not bar condemnation by the New York City School Construction Authority of a leasehold interest in real property owned by the City of New York and designated for urban renewal. The Public Authorities Law expressly permits the condemnation of City-owned property, provided that the City, through its mayor, is first given the right to object to such taking.  The importance of public renewal does not dictate a different result. While the Legislature has stated that urban redevelopment is &quot;a superior public use,&quot; it has also stated that there can be no higher priority than creating a physical environment in the schools that fosters the education of children.  To further that end, Public Authorities Law &sect; 1728 (17) authorizes the Authority &quot;[t]o do any and all things necessary or convenient to carry out and exercise the powers given and granted by this section.&quot; Inasmuch as the Authority seeks to condemn the property in order to provide schools to relieve severe overcrowding, and it has complied with the appropriate statutory procedures, it was authorized to condemn the property.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Condemnation of Leasehold Interest in Urban Renewal Property by School District </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The holder of a leasehold interest in real property designated for urban renewal and owned by the City of New York does not have a state constitutional right to develop the property.  Accordingly, the New York City School Construction Authority may validly condemn the property in order to construct a school which will relieve overcrowding at other schools.  While article XVIII, &sect; 1 of the New York State Constitution gives the Legislature the power to establish urban renewal projects, it does not confer any protection on redevelopers against condemnation. By contrast, the Authority has unquestioned authority to act to relieve the severe overcrowding in community schools.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the trial court (New York) that convicted defendant of six first degree murder counts, attempted first degree murder, and second degree criminal possession of a weapon in violation of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the early morning hours of December 7, 1996, defendant entered a Brooklyn social club. After drinking his beer and smoking some cigarettes, defendant went to the bathroom. When he emerged, defendant demanded money from one customer who handed defendant over $ 200. defendant directed the bartender to approach him. As the bartender walked past him, defendant turned and shot him in the head at point-blank range. defendant then proceeded to kill three other patrons, and attempted to kill two others. He was apprehended approximately two weeks later. Following his conviction and death sentence, on appeal, defendant argued 28 assignments of error. The appellate court, on direct appeal, found that defendant failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality with respect to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 270.20(1)(f). Further, to the extent the trial court may have forecast the type of individual who could avoid jury service when it described the life/death qualification process, there was no prejudice to defendant.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand Jury - Instructions to Jury - Prosecutor Not Required to Present Mitigating Defense </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A prosecutor is not required to present mitigating defenses to a grand jury. Unlike exculpatory defenses, which may result in a finding of no criminal liability, mitigating defenses only reduce the gravity of the offense committed.  While a grand jury instructed on an exculpatory defense might avoid an unwarranted prosecution, the same result would not follow if it were instructed on a mitigating defense.  Accordingly, the prosecutor in a homicide case was not obliged to give the grand jury an instruction on intoxication, which, like a mitigating defense, merely reduces the gravity of the offense by negating an element.  The suggestion that the rule should be different in capital cases should not be followed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand Jury - Instructions to Jury - Capital Murder - Mercy-Dispensing Power - Mitigation Relative to Punishment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The prosecutor in a capital murder case is not required to instruct the grand jury on its mercy-dispensing power or on the consideration of mitigating evidence relating to punishment.  There is no authority mandating that the prosecutor charge the grand jury on mercy, even in a potential capital case. It is presumed that the grand jury will exercise mercy on its own accord.  The decision to seek the death penalty is within the discretion of the prosecutor. The determination to impose the death penalty falls to the petit jury, not the grand jury. Thus, the prosecutor is not required to advise the grand jury that it has the power to seek out and consider evidence that mitigates punishment, or inform the grand jury that defendant requested presentation of such evidence.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Predicate Felonies - Violence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In determining that the predicate felonies for first-degree felony murder should be those that are potentially the most violent and involve a substantial risk of physical injury (e.g., robbery), the Legislature's decision to exclude felonies of a similar or higher grade (e.g., grand larceny) that lack the inherent potential for violence and physical injury was rational.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Constitutionality of Life/Death Qualification of Jury </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a capital murder prosecution, defendant has failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality with respect to death qualification of prospective jurors under CPL 270.20 (1) (f).  Death qualification ensures that prospective jurors are able to consider the death penalty. The statute sets forth the standard and procedure for excluding ineligible jurors. Death qualification at the beginning of the trial has been approved by the United States Supreme Court and is designed to serve the state's legitimate interest in obtaining a single jury that can properly and impartially apply the law to the facts of the case at both the guilt and sentencing phases of a capital trial.  Neither the state's constitutional counterpart of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial (NY Const, art I, &sect; 2) nor its jurisprudence suggests that defendant is entitled to greater protection under the State Constitution than under federal precepts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Life/Death Qualification of Jury - Impartial Jury </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Pretrial death qualification of a jury in a capital case, which ensures that prospective jurors are able to consider the death penalty, does not abrogate a defendant's right to an impartial jury.  Defense counsel specifically asked every final panel if any prospective juror believed that, as a result of the qualification process, defendant was presumed guilty, and not one expressed that opinion.  While defendant asserts that certain sociological studies, taken collectively, indicate that a death-qualified jury is more likely to convict, those studies provide no solid proof that pretrial death-qualification detrimentally conditions a jury, leads to a more conviction-prone jury, or excludes identifiable groups of people.  Death qualification does not impair jury panel diversity.  Rather, the State has a valid interest in excluding jurors from a capital trial whose views on the death penalty, whatever they may be, render them unable to perform their sworn duty to try the entire case free of prejudice.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Jury Selection - Judge's Explanation of Life/Death Qualification Process to Prospective Jurors </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. In a capital murder prosecution, to the extent that the trial court may have forecast the type of individual who could avoid jury service when it described the life/death qualification process and stressed that jurors should be open to both available sentencing options after a guilty verdict, defendant was not prejudiced.  It is presumed that jurors follow their oaths, answer the questions put to them truthfully, and abide by the court's instructions.  However, the way in which a court conducts death/life qualification should encourage honesty and frankness in a juror's responses without seeming to place a value or reward on a &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;appropriate&quot; answer.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Jury Selection - Group Voir Dire </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. CPL 270.16 (1), which directs that the court permit the parties on motion &quot;to examine the prospective jurors individually and outside the presence of the other prospective jurors regarding their qualifications to serve as jurors,&quot; does not require only individual voir dire in capital cases.  CPL 270.15 (1) (c) states that the court shall permit both parties to examine the prospective jurors &quot;individually or collectively&quot; regarding their qualifications to serve as jurors. There is nothing to suggest that in adding CPL 270.16, the Legislature intended to supersede CPL 270.15.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Life/Death Qualification of Jury - Standard for Excluding Prospective Juror </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8. In a capital murder case, the trial court applied the proper standard in determining for-cause challenges during the CPL 270.20 (1) (f) life/death qualification, which is meant to ensure that jurors be open to both available sentencing options after a guilty verdict.  The standard established by the United States Supreme Court for determining if prospective jurors may be excluded for cause because of their views on capital punishment is whether those views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties as jurors in accordance with their instructions and their oath. CPL 270.20 (1) (f) provides that jurors may be excluded for cause when their views on the death penalty &quot;preclude&quot; them from performing their duties. The word &quot;preclude&quot; relates to a juror's ability to act impartially and follow a court's instructions.  It is not a measurement of the strength of an individual's feelings on the death penalty. The focus is on jurors' ability to serve impartially, and not how the death penalty affects them generally. Therefore, the word &quot;preclude&quot; must be understood as an embodiment of the standard set down by the United States Supreme Court.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Prospective Jurors' Views on Capital Punishment - Particular Case </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9. Jurors cannot be excluded for cause from participating on a jury in a capital case where they express conscientious views concerning the death penalty yet make clear that they are able to follow their oaths to act impartially. Because the entire statutory and constitutional line of inquiry is directed toward determining if a juror's attitude for or against the death penalty would affect that person's capability to sit fairly in the particular case at hand, it necessarily follows that a prosecutor's inquiry may properly focus on the jurors' views as they relate to the case at hand, not merely in the abstract.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Jurors - Challenge to Jury - Capital Murder Trial - Potential Juror Skeptical of Proffered Mitigating Factor </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10. In a capital murder prosecution, the trial court did not erroneously deny defendant's for-cause challenge to a juror who expressed skepticism about the validity of a proffered mitigating factor (i.e., child abuse as a cause of adult behavior), where defendant's challenge was premised solely on CPL 270.20 (1) (f), which provides that a prospective juror may be challenged for cause if his or her attitudes toward the death penalty preclude him or her from rendering an impartial verdict or properly determining the sentence. The juror was never asked if her uncertainties concerning the mitigating factor would affect her views on the death penalty in general or in its application to the case after the verdict.  Critically, she was never asked if despite her doubts concerning the significance of the proffered mitigating evidence, she could still vote to give defendant life without parole.  The statute is specifically directed at the potential juror whose views concerning the death penalty preclude the juror from serving during either stage of a capital trial.  Thus, the statute anticipates a connection between the juror's attitude regarding a mitigator and its effect on that juror's consideration of the appropriate sentence, yet defendant made no such correlation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disclosure - Notes of Nontestifying Expert </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 11. In a capital murder prosecution in which defendant claims that he acted under extreme emotional disturbance, the trial court did not exceed its authority by ordering the disclosure of notes used by defendant's nontestifying expert as part of his examination, where defendant's testifying expert relied upon the report of the nontestifying expert in evaluating defendant.  Thus, the notes were disclosable as documents relating to defendant's extreme emotional disturbance defense (CPL 240.30 [1] [a]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Witnesses - Rebuttal Witness - Cumulative or Bolstering Testimony Not Admissible </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 12. In a capital murder prosecution, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing defendant's request to present a rebuttal witness to refute the findings of the prosecution's psychologist.  The proposed rebuttal testimony disagreed with the prosecution's psychologist concerning the significance of tests both had performed, and the latter's conclusion that defendant did not suffer any significant neuropsychological impairments. However, the rebuttal witness did not challenge the testing methods or results of the prosecution's witness, only their significance.  In essence, the rebuttal opinion as to the tests was no different than that of defendant's expert who initially testified--both relied on the same data.  Thus, virtually all of the proffered rebuttal testimony was cumulative to, and corroborative of, the evidence presented on defendant's case-in-chief on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Fair Trial - Testimony of Victims' Family Members </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 13. In a capital murder prosecution in which testimony of some of the victims' family members exceeded the identification of the victims and supplied information about the victims' personal backgrounds, defendant's constitutional claims that the admission of that testimony deprived him of a fair trial and due process are arguably unpreserved.  Defendant did not object and move to strike any testimony that went beyond identification until after all of the victims' family members had testified, thereby depriving the trial court of an opportunity to avoid the error.  To the extent that defendant's claims may be preserved, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Appeal - Preservation of Issue for Review - Prosecutor's Reference during Summation to Defendant's Alleged Smiling during Testimony of Other Witnesses </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 14. In a capital murder case, defendant's single-word objections to the prosecutor's reference during summation to defendant allegedly having smiled during the testimony of two witnesses fell far short of apprising the court that defendant's constitutional rights against compelled self-incrimination, to due process, to a fair jury trial, and to confront those who testify against him, were allegedly violated.  Moreover, defendant's motion to set aside the verdict based on the prosecutor's conduct does not cure his failure to register a specific objection.  Were defendant's claims to be reviewed in the interest of justice, the error would be found harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Instructions - Capital Murder - Defense of Extreme Emotional Disturbance </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 15. In a capital murder case, the trial court's instruction was sufficient to convey the need for unanimity with respect to the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. The question asked of the jury on the verdict sheet to which both sides subscribed--whether defendant established the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance--could only be answered yes or no.  Prior to deliberations, the jury was instructed that the goal of the process was an unanimous verdict.  They were told that they needed to come to an unanimous agreement as to the facts of the case.  When the jury inquired whether it had to be unanimous in answering the question on the affirmative defense, they were told &quot;yes.&quot; Finally, when each individual juror was polled to ascertain whether the verdict announced by the foreperson was their verdict in all respects, each juror stated &quot;yes.&quot; Thus, taking the trial court's instructions, supplemental instructions and the polling into consideration, the jury reasonably understood that its decision with respect to defendant's affirmative defense required unanimity.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Unconstitutional Plea Procedures </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 16. In a capital murder case in which defendant was prosecuted under a procedure in which only those defendants who exercised their Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to plead not guilty and to a jury trial put themselves at risk of death, defendant's sentence of death must be vacated.  The procedure in question impermissibly discouraged defendant's assertion of his constitutional rights.  Accordingly, the appropriate remedy is to vacate the sentence and remit the case to Supreme Court for resentencing in accordance with Penal Law &sect;&sect; 60.06 and 70.00 (5).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two appeals involving New York's Consumer Protection Act were consolidated. In the first action, plaintiff insured appealed the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirming the dismissal of the claim brought against defendant insurers. In the second action, plaintiff consumers appealed the judgment seeking to reinstate their claims against defendant internet provider.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first action, the insured, a Florida resident, purchased a vanishing premium policy from the insurer. The insured sued under N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 349 claiming the vanishing premium was a deceptive scheme. The trial court dismissed the action because the insured purchased the policy in Florida. In the second action, New York and out-of-state consumers subscribed to the provider's DSL service and were dissatisfied with its performance. They alleged that, contrary to the provider's representations, the service was slow and unreliable and customer service was inadequate. The trial court denied the provider's motion under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211(a)(1), (7), and the appellate court reversed, dismissing the consumers' complaint. On appeal, the state high court noted the common issue to both appeals was whether an allegedly deceptive scheme that originated in New York but injured a consumer in a transaction outside the State, constituted an actionable deceptive practice under N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 349(a). After reviewing the language and legislative intent of the statute, the state high court concluded the transaction in which the consumer was deceived had to occur in New York.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer Protection - Deceptive Acts and Practices - Injury Outside of New York </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. An allegedly deceptive scheme that originates in New York but injures a consumer in a transaction outside the state does not constitute an actionable deceptive act or practice under General Business Law &sect; 349 (a).  The statutory reference to deceptive practices in &quot;the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state&quot; unambiguously evinces a legislative intent to address commercial misconduct occurring within New York.  &quot;In this state&quot; can only modify &quot;the conduct of any business, trade or commerce [or] the furnishing of any service.&quot; The statutory phrase &quot;deceptive acts or practices&quot; refers not to the mere invention of a scheme or marketing strategy, but rather to the actual misrepresentation or omission to a consumer. Thus, to qualify as a prohibited act under the statute, the deception of a consumer must occur in New York.  To apply the statute to out-of-state transactions would lead to an unwarranted expansive reading of the statute, contrary to legislative intent, and potentially lead to the nationwide, if not global, application of section 349.  </SPAN></P>

The origin of any advertising or promotional conduct is irrelevant if the deception itself--that is, the advertisement or promotional package--did not result in a transaction in which the consumer was harmed.

Defendants' documentation illustrating a 30-day trial period and the contractual terms and conditions, including a product disclaimer, does not bar plaintiffs' claims for deceptive trade practices at the pleading stage of the proceedings, as such documentation does not establish a defense as a matter of law. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Educ.

The state high court held that (1) although the New York State Legislature typically and necessarily functioned as a bicameral body in its lawmaking capacity, it could also function unicamerally when performing duties other than lawmaking; (2) the legislature was acting in a non-lawmaking capacity when it met to elect regents using the joint ballot provisions of N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The joint ballot provisions of Education Law &sect; 202 (1), (2), providing for an alternative means of electing members of the State Board of Regents, where the Senate and Assembly fail to elect by concurrent resolution, do not violate NY Constitution, article XI, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2.  The Constitution gives the Legislature control over the regents, and for more than two centuries the joint ballot has been an integral part of the procedure for selecting regents. The quintessential &quot;legislative power,&quot; its lawmaking power, unlike the power to elect regents, is directly conferred to and vested in the Senate and the Assembly by the Constitution.  The constitutional lawmaking prescription does not, however, negate or undermine the Legislature's ability to convene as a unicameral body, in a distinct, nonlawmaking capacity.  The Legislature--whether functioning bicamerally, or sitting in joint session and acting unicamerally--is nevertheless the &quot;legislature&quot; as it is understood in article XI.  </SPAN></P>

Because the settlement letter mirrored the provisions contained in the circular letter, it was improper.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Actions taken by the Department of Insurance pursuant to its interpretation of Insurance Law &sect; 2610 (b), which is intended to discourage the use of &quot;referral&quot; body shops by insurers and to prevent &quot;steering&quot; claimants to particular shops, are invalid. The literal language of the statute restricts when an insurance company can make recommendations that repairs be performed at a particular shop. It does not regulate speech on subjects other than recommendations or suggestions about particular shops, nor regulate the content or placement of material promoting an insurance company's repair program, nor regulate discussion or distribution of its text.  Accordingly, the Department may not prohibit an insurer from distributing to insureds brochures that mention or describe a repair program or a guarantee of repair programs, posting signs at insurer locations that mention or describe a repair program, initiating communication that might prompt an insured to request a repair shop recommendation or information from the insurer, discussing an insured's repair shop choice, or mentioning the mere existence of section 2610 (b) to an insured. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The rejection by the Department of Insurance of an insurer's proposed preferred repairer promotion, in which the insurer would reduce the cost of coverage if the insured agreed to have repairs made at body shops recommended by the insurer, was based on restrictions not supported by Insurance Law &sect; 2610 (b).  The promotion does not require that an insurance company request, recommend or suggest a particular repair shop while an insurer has an active claim, but rather requires a prospective claimant to agree to use a preferred repairer for a reduced contract fee. Accordingly, inasmuch as the statutory restrictions on recommending particular body shops are implicated only when an insured has an active claim, section 2610 (b) does not provide a ground for rejecting the preferred repairer promotion in question.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Appellate Division (New York) affirming a trial court's inclusion, in her sentence for filing false instruments with the county social services department, of a requirement that she make restitution to the department in the amount overpaid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was prosecuted for various theft crimes and filing false instruments after her county social services department discovered that she had failed to note income from various jobs in her filings for welfare benefits. She was convicted and sentenced to probation, subject to a restitution order. The high court upheld the award of restitution, and its amount, holding that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 60.27 required consideration of, and allowed for awards of, restitution in all felony sentencing proceedings. Although the award exceeded the statutory cap, this was permissible because it represented the actual losses, in overpayments, suffered by the social services department, the victim. The restitution order was not an unconstitutional sentencing increase under the rule of Apprendi, because such orders fell squarely within the statutory sentencing range.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a prosecution arising out of defendant's failure to include accurate income information on social services benefit recertification forms, resulting in her conviction of three counts of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree, the sentencing court did not err in directing defendant to repay the benefit overpayments she received as a result of filing the false documents.  Penal Law &sect; 60.27 (1) allows a court to order a &quot;person convicted of an offense&quot; to &quot;make restitution of the fruits of [that] offense or reparation for the actual out-of-pocket loss caused thereby.&quot; The term &quot;offense&quot; is broadly defined and because there is no statutory limitation on the types of criminal conduct that can support a sentence of restitution or reparation, restitution is a viable sentence for any crime provided there is a recognizable victim who has suffered &quot;actual out-of-pocket loss&quot; or there are discernible &quot;fruits of the offense.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Restitution - Receiving Overpayments of Social Services Benefits - Intent to Defraud </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree falls within the broad definition of &quot;offense&quot; contained in Penal Law &sect; 60.27, which permits a court to impose restitution or reparation as part of a sentence. Although defendant, who was convicted of the aforementioned felony arising out of her failure to include accurate income information on social services benefit recertification forms, maintained that she lacked a criminal intent, she did not contest the proof adduced at trial that she failed to disclose the income she received from four employers on recertification forms filed during the benefit periods.  In finding defendant guilty, the jury necessarily concluded that defendant offered written instruments containing false statements or information &quot;with intent to defraud the state or any political subdivision&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 175.35).  When it ordered restitution, the sentencing court found that defendant had received overpayments as a result of the filing of false documents.  The record therefore supports an order of restitution or reparation. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a prosecution arising out of defendant's failure to include accurate income information on social services benefit recertification forms, the fact that defendant was acquitted of welfare fraud, misuse of food stamps and grand larceny does not impugn the legality of the otherwise authorized sentence of restitution imposed, in addition to probation, upon defendant's conviction for three counts of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree.  Defendant's acquittal of the so-called &quot;theft offenses&quot; does not lead to the conclusion that the jury must have determined that the local social services agency did not suffer any out-of-pocket losses.  An acquittal of criminal charges is not equivalent to a finding of innocence, but stands for the proposition that a jury was not convinced of defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Where a jury verdict is not repugnant, it is imprudent to speculate concerning the factual determinations that underlay the verdict, because what might appear to be an irrational verdict may actually constitute a jury's permissible exercise of mercy or leniency.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a prosecution arising out of defendant's failure to include accurate income information on social services benefit recertification forms, resulting in her conviction of three counts of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree, the sentencing court did not err in directing defendant to repay the benefit overpayments she received as a result of filing the false documents.  Defendant's argument that the sentencing court erred in relying on the charges of which she was acquitted when imposing its restitution sentence need not be addressed because there is no indication that the court considered facts relating to the acquitted offenses when it directed restitution. Moreover, to the extent that defendant challenges the amount of the restitution order as lacking record support, that claim is not properly reviewable since defendant did not request a hearing to determine the sum of benefit overpayments or otherwise challenge the amount of the restitution order during the sentencing proceeding.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Restitution - Receiving Overpayments of Social Services Benefits - Statutory &quot;Cap&quot; on Amount of Restitution </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. The sentencing court did not err in ordering defendant, who received overpayments of social services benefits, to make restitution to a local social services department in an amount over $ 15,000 following her conviction of three counts of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree.  Although paragraph (a) of Penal Law &sect; 60.27 (5) provides that, except with the consent of defendant or in instances where restitution is ordered as a condition of probation or conditional discharge, &quot;the amount of restitution or reparation required by the court shall not exceed fifteen thousand dollars in the case of a conviction for a felony,&quot; that provision is qualified by paragraph (b), which allows a court to order restitution in excess of that amount as long as the sum is &quot;limited to the return of the victim's property, including money, or the equivalent value thereof.&quot; Defendant was convicted of three felonies covering three distinct benefit periods, and the amount of restitution attributable to each offense could be allocated separately, bringing the amount ordered for each offense well under $ 15,000.  Even if defendant had been convicted of only one offense, the amount in excess of $ 15,000 would meet the dictates of section 60.27 (5) because the entire amount of defendant's restitution order was intended to reimburse the social services department for the equivalent value of benefit overpayments she received.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Restitution - Factual Determinations by Sentencing Court </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. The sentencing court did not make improper factual determinations in ordering defendant, who received overpayments of social services benefits, to make restitution to a local social services department. Restitution falls within the range of sentences available for any offense in New York; it is not a post-conviction sentencing enhancement mechanism.  While Penal Law &sect; 60.27 limits the types of expenses reimbursable in restitution orders exceeding $ 15,000 for a felony or $ 10,000 for a misdemeanor, the statute does not restrict the maximum amount of restitution that can be awarded.  Accordingly, a sentencing court is not increasing the maximum sentence available when it makes factual determinations affecting restitution, but is merely issuing a sentence within the authorized statutory range.  Because the restitution order in question does nothing more than compensate the social services department for losses sustained as a result of defendant's criminal conduct, it does not violate the principle that a court may not increase the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum without submitting to a jury and proving beyond a reasonable doubt any fact upon which the increase is based.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. Reversal of defendant's conviction of three counts of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree is not required where defendant was absent from the courtroom when the court denied her motion to set aside the verdict and discharged the jury the day after the verdict was announced. Inasmuch as the proceeding at issue involved only questions of law or procedure, defendant's presence was not required.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had pled guilty to murder with the understanding he would receive life without parole. While his direct appeal was pending before the Appellate Division (New York), defendant initiated a N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10 proceeding to vacate his conviction asserting a subsequent case rendered his plea invalid and his sentence illegal. The trial court denied the application. The appellate division affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People never filed a N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 250.40 notice of intent to seek the death penalty against defendant for killing his parents. During the plea colloquy, defendant withdrew his omnibus motion, which included claims that certain provisions of the first degree murder statute were unconstitutionally vague and that the integrity of the grand jury proceeding was impaired. Arguing that invalidation of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 220.10(5)(e) and N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 220.30(3)(b)(vii) by a New York case, Hynes, effectively eliminated any statutory authorization for a sentence of life imprisonment without parole upon a plea to murder in the first degree, defendant contended he was entitled to be resentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 20-to-25 years to life. Because the trial court's sentencing authority was not derived from the plea provisions struck in Hynes, the court of appeals disagreed. Defendant did not raise the alleged constitutional infirmity before he pleaded guilty or was sentenced by the trial court, and it was therefore unpreserved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Validity of Plea under Death Penalty Statute and Imposition of Life Sentence without Parole </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a prosecution for first degree murder where no notice to seek a sentence of death was filed, defendant, who never faced the death penalty and pleaded guilty, may be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The invalidation of certain plea provisions of the State's death penalty law by the Court of Appeals did not eliminate the statutory authorization for a sentence of life imprisonment without parole upon a plea of guilty to murder in the first degree, since the trial court's sentencing authority is not derived from those statutes.  CPL 400.27, which sets forth sentencing procedures in death penalty cases, provides that the People may elect not to seek the death penalty &quot;at any time,&quot; and that in such case the court &quot;may sentence * * * defendant to life imprisonment without parole.&quot; The phrase &quot;at any time&quot; demonstrates that the statute applies to cases in which the People have declined to seek a death sentence, whether before or after expiration of the 120-day period for filing the notice of intent to seek the death penalty. If the People do not pursue a death sentence, the sentencing authority that would otherwise be vested in the jury remains with the trial court.  CPL 400.27 applies to a first degree murder &quot;conviction,&quot; which is defined as &quot;the entry of a plea of guilty * * * or a verdict of guilty&quot; (CPL 1.20 [13]).  Thus, the authority to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without parole exists whether a defendant's conviction is by guilty plea or jury verdict.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Appeal - Preservation of Issue for Review - Legality of Sentence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In an appeal of a judgment convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of first degree murder and sentencing defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, defendant's challenge to the legality of his sentence, even though the product of a negotiated plea agreement, is reviewable because the right to be sentenced as provided by law creates a narrow exception to the requirement that arguments must be properly preserved in order to be reviewed by the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Appeal - Preservation of Issue for Review - Voluntariness of Guilty Plea </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In an appeal to the Court of Appeals from a judgment convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of first degree murder and sentencing defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, and from an order denying defendant's CPL 440.10 motion to vacate the judgment of conviction and sentence, defendant's contention that his conviction was affected by a mistake of law because he pleaded guilty pursuant to statutory provisions later invalidated by the Court of Appeals, thus rendering his negotiated guilty plea invalid as involuntary, is not reviewable. Defendant presents an issue of law founded on a federal constitutional principle established more than a quarter-century ago.  However, defendant did not raise this alleged constitutional infirmity before he pleaded guilty or was sentenced, and it is therefore unpreserved.  Because defendant's claim does not involve factual matters beyond the scope of the record or legal issues which could not have been asserted before the final judgment of conviction, it was not the proper subject of a CPL 440.10 motion.  Nor does defendant allege a facial defect in his allocution that would permit review by the Court of Appeals notwithstanding his failure to preserve the issue.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In an appeal of a judgment convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of first degree murder, defendant's contention that certain portions of the first degree murder statute are unconstitutionally vague was abandoned when he expressly withdrew all motions pending before Supreme Court, thereby precluding the creation of a record or a ruling subject to appellate review. Defendant's challenge to the integrity of the Grand Jury proceeding, which was also asserted in the omnibus motion he retracted, was likewise abandoned, and is therefore unreviewable.  Although Supreme Court had issued a ruling in connection with defendant's request for &quot;heightened due process&quot; consideration, he forfeited his right to appeal this issue by pleading guilty.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city and its collective bargaining board sought review of affirmance, by the Supreme Court, Appellate Division (New York), of a ruling, in consolidated declaratory judgment actions by the city and appellee police union, that 1998 N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New York's Taylor Law, N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 200 et seq., permitted local governments to establish their own collective bargaining boards, in addition to the state agency, the New York State Public Employment Relations Board (PERB). 1998 N.Y. Laws ch. 641 amended N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 212 to give the PERB jurisdiction over disputes between police and fire unions in the four counties that had their own boards, in the event that negotiations reached an impasse. New York City and its local board resisted the police union's efforts to transfer a dispute to the PERB, arguing that the amendment was an unconstitutional special law, but the high court held that it did not violate N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, because it covered all four counties and addressed a substantial state concern. The amendment did not, however, deprive local boards of jurisdiction to address scope of bargaining issues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Chapter 641 of the Laws of 1998, which amended the Taylor Law to allow police and fire unions in any municipality with a local impasse resolution system to take their collective bargaining disputes to the State Public Employment Relations Board (PERB), is constitutional and enforceable. Chapter 641 is a &quot;special law&quot; that serves a substantial State concern, and thus, the home rule requirements of the State Constitution were not implicated.  While chapter 641, by its terms, applies to all local governments, its actual effect is a restriction targeted at only the four localities that exercised the option to use a local, alternate administrative dispute resolution body.  Although chapter 641 is a special law, it was enacted in furtherance of and bears a reasonable relationship to the substantial State-wide concern of fostering orderly resolution of collective bargaining disputes involving police and fire bargaining units in order to enhance public safety and prevent the loss or interruption of vital public services.  Further, fulfillment of this legislative purpose is rationally served by chapter 641, which mandates that all local governments allow their police and fire unions access to PERB impasse procedures in resolving public sector labor disputes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Public Employees' Fair Employment Act - Impasse Jurisdiction over Collective Bargaining Disputes between New York City and Public Safety Unions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a collective bargaining dispute between the City of New York and a public safety union, once the union opts to seek impasse resolution by the State Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) and PERB declares an impasse, chapter 641 of the Laws of 1998 gives the Board exclusive jurisdiction to resolve such an impasse. Until such time, the City Board of Collective Bargaining (BCB) retains jurisdiction to determine scope of bargaining outside of the impasse context.  Accordingly, PERB does not have exclusive jurisdiction over scope of bargaining disputes between the City and its public safety unions.  In order to determine whether an impasse exists as to &quot;conditions of employment,&quot; PERB must be authorized to determine what qualifies as a proper condition of employment because if the impasse does not relate to a condition of employment, PERB has no authority to render assistance. Because chapter 641 did not amend Civil Service Law &sect; 205 (5) (d), which authorizes BCB to exercise jurisdiction over improper practice charges, or alter BCB's improper practice jurisdiction, BCB retains jurisdiction to decide whether an issue constitutes a mandatory subject of bargaining in the context of an improper practice proceeding.  Accordingly, the Legislature has accorded both agencies jurisdiction over scope of bargaining in negotiations between a public safety union and the City.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff clients sued defendant attorneys, alleging breach of fiduciary and ethical obligations and legal malpractice. The trial court ruled that its judgment in a prior action filed by the attorneys' former partner was controlling and it awarded judgment to the clients. The attorneys appealed and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed. The case was certified to the state's highest court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two clients brought an action seeking to terminate all interests which their former attorneys had in a trust that was created to compensate the attorneys for legal services. That action followed a prior and separate lawsuit (first action) that was filed by a former partner in the attorneys' law firm against the clients and raised the issue of whether the trust was valid. Although the attorneys were added as parties to the first action, they chose not to participate actively in that action, but instead moved to stay the second action until the first action was resolved. In the first action, the trial court ruled that the trust was invalid. Thereafter, the second action was tried and the trial court invoked the doctrine of res judicata to rule a second time that the trust was invalid. The state's highest court held that because the issues in the first action and the second action were the same, the doctrine of res judicata applied. This was especially true because the attorneys knew that the validity of the trust was being vigorously contested in the first action and that an adverse ruling would have serious consequences for them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgments - Collateral Estoppel - Person in Privity with Party against Whom Issue Decided - Former Law Partners </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. For the purpose of applying collateral estoppel to preclude defendant attorneys from relitigating the validity of fee arrangements determined to be illegal in an earlier action, they were in privity with their former law partner against whom the issue was decided.  Defendants were parties in the prior action, which was commenced by their former partner. Although they were not named in the counterclaim in which, after extensive pretrial and trial proceedings involving defendants, the legality of the fee arrangements was decided, defendants and their former partner were co-signatories to the fee agreement and co-beneficiaries to the trust proceeds arising from the agreement.  Defendants' rights to receive payments were coextensive with those of their former partner and derived from the identical arrangement entered into when they were partners. Moreover, defendants themselves recognized that adjudication of their former partner's conduct as partner or agent of the law firm would have consequences for them.  Thus, their interests were aligned with respect to the fee arrangements for the purpose of applying collateral estoppel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgments - Collateral Estoppel - Full and Fair Opportunity to Litigate - Litigation Tactics </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Collateral estoppel is available to preclude defendant attorneys from relitigating the validity of fee arrangements determined to be illegal in a counterclaim in an earlier action, notwithstanding that they were not initially named in the counterclaim and successfully opposed its later assertion against them.  They were parties in that action with notice of the issues to be decided and, as such, could not sit by idly while the contract involving the fee arrangements, to which they were also parties, was judicially construed without being precluded by the result.  Defendants cannot be rewarded for their conscious, tactical decision not to take a more active role in that litigation by now allowing relitigation of the very same issues and facts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgments - Collateral Estoppel - Identity of Issue </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. For the purpose of applying collateral estoppel to preclude defendant attorneys from relitigating the validity of fee arrangements determined to be illegal as against their former law partner in an earlier action, the issues in the present action in which defendants seek to enforce certain agreements that incorporate those fee arrangements are identical with those already litigated and decided in the prior action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgments - Collateral Estoppel - Full and Fair Opportunity to Litigate </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. For the purpose of applying collateral estoppel to preclude defendant attorneys from relitigating the validity of fee arrangements determined to be illegal as against their former law partner in an earlier action, defendants have failed to establish the lack of a full and fair opportunity to litigate the validity of the fee arrangements in that action.  The former partner, with whom defendants were in privity, vigorously defended the validity of the trust that was dependent on the fee arrangements.  In addition, defendants were not just nominal parties but, as beneficiaries of the trust, were essential parties whose rights were affected by the outcome of the prior action. Defendants produced documents for the litigation, received copies of select documents used in the trial and agreed to testify as witnesses, before changing their minds at the last minute.  Although Supreme Court denied a motion to join defendants in the counterclaim in the prior action that disposed of the essential issue, that fact does not undermine the holding that the fee agreement was unenforceable.  Additionally, while defendants were authorized to seek a stay of the present action pending a determination in the prior one, intending to invoke the benefits of the judgment if the outcome was favorable to them, under the circumstances this fact may be taken into account in analyzing whether defendants should be bound by the prior determination.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Jurisdiction - Peripheral Patent Issue Not Preemptive </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. An action alleging that an attorney fee arrangement and a corresponding trust agreement are illegal and unenforceable is not subject to exclusive Federal jurisdiction where plaintiff inventors are claiming that defendant attorneys failed to disclose potential conflicts of interest in their representation concerning plaintiffs' application for a patent. Plaintiffs did not plead any substantive questions of patent law as an element of the claims asserted against defendants.  Rather, the case addresses the necessary disclosures attorneys must make and the ethical obligations they must maintain in the course of their interaction with clients.  Although Federal patent law recognizes that attorneys may receive an interest in patents in lieu of traditional fee arrangements, the need for disclosure mandated by the Code of Professional Responsibility governing the practice of law in this State is not obviated.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On consolidated appeal, two defendants appealed the Supreme Court, Appellate Division (New York) affirmances of their convictions, and in the third case, the People appealed a county court's reversal of defendant's conviction. The issue in all three was whether pretextual traffic stops were permissible under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three different cases, with varying results upon defendants' motions to suppress, police officers who had observed suspicious conduct inside automobiles stopped the cars after having observed traffic infractions, and arrests for more serious offenses resulted. Federal constitutional law had already settled, in the Whren case, that such stops did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV when they were based on actual violations of law, but it had not yet been determined whether such actions were permissible under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, which contained identical language to that of the Fourth Amendment. The high court adopted the rule of Whren, after noting that victims of racial profiling had other remedies under New York law, and that police officers could not otherwise be said to be acting arbitrarily when they acted in response to actual violations of law. The fact that many New Yorkers violated traffic laws was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments in the cases in which orders to suppress had been denied.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Unlawful Search and Seizure - Validity of Pretextual Traffic Stop - Probable Cause to Believe Driver Committed Traffic Infraction </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Whren v United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (517 US 806), which held that if a police officer has probable cause to detain a person temporarily for a traffic violation, that seizure does not violate the Fourth Amendment even though the underlying reason for the stop might have been to investigate some other matter, is adopted as a matter of state law.  Thus, a police officer who has probable cause to believe a driver has committed a traffic infraction does not violate article I, &sect; 12 of the New York State Constitution when the officer, whose primary motivation is to conduct another investigation, stops the vehicle.  In making that determination of probable cause, neither the primary motivation of the officer nor a determination of what a reasonable traffic officer would have done under the circumstances is relevant.  The Vehicle and Traffic Law provides an objective standard for the police to follow, and regulating the ability of the police to stop a vehicle when there is probable cause to believe that a traffic regulation has been violated does little to expand the rights of the accused.  However, the scope, duration and intensity of the seizure, as well as any search made by the police subsequent to the stop, remain subject to the strictures of article I, &sect; 12 and judicial review.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Unlawful Search and Seizure - Validity of Pretextual Traffic Stop - Arbitrariness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In determining the legality of police conduct in the context of a traffic stop by officers whose primary motivation was to conduct another investigation, arbitrariness is not an added inquiry separate and distinct from probable cause. A police officer who can articulate credible facts establishing reasonable cause to believe that someone has violated a law has established a reasonable basis to effectuate a stop.  There is no basis to distinguish violations of New York's criminal laws from infractions of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. While New Yorkers may ubiquitously disobey parts of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, that does not render its commands unenforceable. Because the Vehicle and Traffic Law provides an objective grid upon which to measure probable cause, a stop based on that standard is not arbitrary in the context of constitutional search and seizure jurisprudence.  It is the violation of the Vehicle and Traffic Law that both triggers an officer's authority to make a stop and limits the officer's discretion.  Moreover, the &quot;reasonable police officer&quot; test, which ties the legality of the police officers' conduct to the determination of whether a reasonable traffic police officer would have made the stop, should not be followed since it would result in inappropriate selective enforcement of traffic laws.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Plaintiff, as a member of the State Assembly, who has the power and responsibility to consider and vote on legislation, has the capacity to bring an action to vindicate the effectiveness of his vote where he alleges that the Governor has acted improperly so as to usurp or nullify his vote by vetoing items in &quot;non-appropriation&quot; bills.  As a member of the Assembly, plaintiff is constitutionally responsible for exercising legislative power, and that responsibility necessarily includes continuing concern for protecting the integrity of one's vote and implies the power to challenge in court the effectiveness of a vote that has allegedly been unconstitutionally nullified. Plaintiff's functional responsibilities as a legislator are not at an end once a bill is voted upon and leaves the Assembly.  Legislators and the districts they represent could be disenfranchised from the budget process if stripped of the capacity to sue when confronted with allegedly unlawful or unconstitutional conduct of others that directly affects their official responsibilities.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Capacity to Sue - Speaker of State Assembly - Improper Veto by Governor </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Plaintiff, as the Speaker of the State Assembly, does not have the inherent capacity to bring an action on behalf of that body to vindicate the effectiveness of his vote where he alleges that the Governor has acted improperly so as to usurp or nullify his vote by vetoing items in &quot;non-appropriation&quot; bills.  The Constitution does not give the Speaker representative authority for the body over which he presides; nor has the Assembly passed a resolution expressing its will that the Speaker engage in such litigation.  The Assembly Speaker is nominally a constitutional officer, but his express statutory powers are circumscribed; other duties are merely administrative.  None of his specific responsibilities are broad enough to confer on him any special implied authority to seek judicial review on behalf of the interests of the Assembly in general.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Member of State Assembly - Improper Veto by Governor - Injury in Fact </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Plaintiff, as a member of the State Assembly, has suffered an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing on him to maintain an action challenging the Governor's line-item veto power where he alleges that the Governor acted improperly so as to usurp or nullify his vote by vetoing items in &quot;non-appropriation&quot; bills.  As a member of the Assembly who voted with the majority in favor of the budget legislation in question, plaintiff undoubtedly has suffered an injury in fact with respect to the alleged unconstitutional nullification of his vote sufficient to confer standing. Such a direct and personal injury is clearly within a legislator's zone of interest and unquestionably represents a concrete and particularized harm. Plaintiff is not seeking to obtain a result in a courtroom which he failed to gain in the halls of the Legislature.  A controlling bloc of legislators (a number sufficient to enact or defeat legislation) is not a prerequisite to plaintiff's standing.  His injury in the nullification of his personal vote continues to exist whether or not other legislators who have suffered the same injury decide to join in the suit.  Moreover, the existence of other possible political remedies does not negate the injury in fact, and the fact that other parties may also be aggrieved by some of the contested vetoes does not diminish the direct injury suffered by plaintiff as a member of the Legislature.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A judge of the Court of Appeals of New York granted leave to both the People and defendant to appeal the appellate division's order upholding defendant's guilty plea to first-degree murder in order to determine whether the plea impermissibly burdened defendant's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for dropping of the State's intent to seek the death penalty. After the plea had been entered but before sentencing, a judicial decision in a different matter was made that struck the plea provisions from the State's death penalty statute. Defendant moved to withdraw his plea, claiming it was invalid as a result of the decision. The appellate division reversed the conviction and restored the parties to their pre-plea positions because the plea rested upon a faulty premise. The court of appeals reviewed similar federal Supreme Court decisions and found no constitutional violations since the guilty plea was voluntarily made. Absent misrepresentation or other impermissible conduct by the State, a voluntary plea was not invalid merely because later judicial decisions indicated that the plea was based on a faulty premise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Appeal - Matters Reviewable - Underlying Order Not Adverse to Defendant </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant's appeal from an order of the Appellate Division reversing a judgment convicting defendant, upon his guilty plea, of first degree murder, vacating defendant's plea and sentence, and restoring the indictment to the pre-plea stage with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty reinstated, must be dismissed.  Although the underlying order granted defendant only partial relief, it was nonetheless not adverse to defendant within the meaning of CPL 450.90 (1) and, thus, the Court of Appeals is not empowered to review defendant's challenges to that order insofar as it upheld the denial of his suppression motion and reinstated the death notice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Plea of Guilty - Withdrawal of Plea - Capital Murder - Validity of Plea Resting on Faulty Premise </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a capital murder case, defendant's guilty plea was not rendered invalid by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Hynes v Tomei</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (92 NY2d 613), which found unconstitutional plea provisions permitting a capital defendant to enter a guilty plea only with the consent of the People and permission of the court, and only when the agreed-upon sentence was either life without parole or a term of years, where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Hynes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was decided after the acceptance of the plea but prior to sentencing.  Absent misrepresentation or other impermissible conduct by state agents, a voluntary plea of guilty intelligently made in light of the then applicable law does not become vulnerable because later judicial decisions indicate that the plea rested on a faulty premise.  The fact that defendant did not anticipate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Hynes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not impugn the truth or reliability of his plea.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Plea of Guilty - Withdrawal of Plea - Capital Murder - Validity of Plea Where Defendant Faced with Choice between Exercising Trial Rights and Risking Death or Waiving Trial Rights and Avoiding Death </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a capital murder case, not all guilty pleas to capital offenses are invalid where a defendant is faced with the choice of exercising Fifth and Sixth Amendment trial rights and risking death, or waiving those rights and pleading guilty in order to avoid that risk.  An otherwise valid plea is not involuntary because induced by defendant's desire to limit the possible maximum penalty to less than that authorized if there is a jury trial. Accordingly, defendant's guilty plea, even if it had been the exclusive means by which he avoided exposure to the risk of imposition of the death penalty, did not, standing alone, violate defendant's Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of seven crimes arising from his fraudulent filing of a false voter registration form and voting in five separate elections in an election district in which he did not reside, claiming that residency definitions under N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 1-104(22) were vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lived in an apartment building located within a voting district. After the building was put into a second district when the boundaries of the election district were redrawn defendant completed and filed a new voter registration form specifying that he resided at a different location within the first district. After his conviction and two appeals, he again appealed claiming that the residency definitions of &sect; 1-104(22) were vague. He also claimed that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on residency. The appellate court recognized that a person could have more than one residence. It held that the jury was not asked to determine if defendant chose the correct residence, but only if he took up the second residence solely for voting purposes. As a result, the jury charge was not confusing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a prosecution for offering a false instrument for filing, false (voter) registration, and illegal voting arising from defendant's alleged maintenance of two residences, defendant's arguments that the Election Law definition of &quot;residence&quot; cannot be applied literally in a case of dual residency, and that a literal application of Election Law &sect; 1-104 (22), wherein &quot;residence&quot; is defined, is vague and unconstitutional, are unpreserved for review by the Court of Appeals.  Defendant, during the jury charge conference, did not object to the specific language of the charge and did not raise any of the constitutional issues now asserted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Instructions - Illegal Voting - Definition of &quot;Residence&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant, who allegedly maintained two residences in different voting districts, was properly convicted of offering a false instrument for filing, false (voter) registration, and illegal voting arising from his fraudulent filing of a false voter registration form and voting in an election district in which he did not reside.  The trial court's jury charge did not dictate a guilty verdict. The crucial determination whether a particular residence complies with the requirements of the Election Law is that the individual must manifest an intent, coupled with physical presence without any aura of sham. The charge, when read as a whole, was not confusing as a matter of law.  It instructed the jury on how to determine whether the residence in question could be considered defendant's residence for voting purposes, and it informed the jury that if the proof established that defendant had two residences, he could pick one as long as the &quot;residence&quot; he picked was indeed a residence of his, and not a sham. The jury credited the testimony of the various witnesses, and duly applied the instruction to the facts it found. The jury was not asked to determine whether as between two residences defendant picked the more appropriate one.  Rather, the sole issue was whether defendant genuinely took up one residence for voting purposes.  In considering whether that residence was a bona fide residence from which defendant could vote, the jury needed to be informed of the Election Law's definition of residence, and it was not instructed to convict defendant if it found that he actually maintained two residences.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff legal aliens sought review of a decision of the Supreme Court Appellate Division, New York, that held that N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A group of legal aliens permanently residing in the United States under color of law (PRUCOLs) were denied Medicaid benefits by the state under N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Social Services Law &sect; 122 violates the United States and New York Constitutions by denying Medicaid benefits funded solely by the State to plaintiffs based on their status as legal aliens. The concept of need plays no part in the operation of the statute, which cannot be justified on the basis of a distinction between &quot;qualified aliens,&quot; i.e., aliens who are lawfully admitted for permanent residence (generally green card holders) or otherwise validly residing in the United States, and those permanently residing in the United States under color of law, i.e., aliens of whom the Immigration and Naturalization Service is aware but has no plans to deport, on the one hand, and citizens on the other.  Section 122 violates the letter and spirit of NY Constitution, article XVII, &sect; 1, which requires the State to provide for the care and support of the needy, by imposing on plaintiffs an overly burdensome eligibility condition having nothing to do with need, thereby depriving them of otherwise available basic necessity benefits.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Medical Assistance - Legal Aliens - Denial of State-Funded Benefits on Basis of Alienage Unconstitutional - Equal Protection - Strict Scrutiny </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Social Services Law &sect; 122 violates the United States and New York Constitutions by denying Medicaid benefits funded solely by the State to plaintiffs based on their status as legal aliens. Inasmuch as section 122 creates classifications based on alienage, a strict scrutiny analysis is appropriate for considering plaintiffs' equal protection claim.  Although section 122 implements title IV of the Federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, whereby a State choosing to follow the Federal classification in determining the eligibility of qualified aliens for public assistance shall be considered to have chosen the least restrictive means available for achieving the compelling government interest of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy, the less stringent rational basis standard is inappropriate.  Given our system of separation of powers, a lawmaking body may not legislatively declare that a statute meets constitutional criteria.  Title IV cannot constitutionally authorize New York to determine for itself the extent to which it will discriminate against legal aliens for State Medicaid eligibility. Although the Federal government has broad constitutional power to distinguish among aliens in setting the rules for their admission and naturalization, Congress does not have power to authorize the individual States to violate the Equal Protection Clause.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Medical Assistance - Legal Aliens - Denial of State-Funded Benefits on Basis of Alienage Unconstitutional - Equal Protection - Strict Scrutiny </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Social Services Law &sect; 122 violates the United States and New York Constitutions by denying Medicaid benefits funded solely by the State to plaintiffs based on their status as legal aliens. Section 122 is subject to and cannot pass strict scrutiny, notwithstanding the authorization of title IV of the Federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, whereby a State may extend the ineligibility period for Federal Medicaid beyond the mandatory five years and terminate Federal Medicaid eligibility for certain refugees and asylees after seven years.  Such authorizations improperly permit the States to adopt divergent laws on the subject of citizenship requirements for federally supported welfare programs.  In the name of national immigration policy, title IV impermissibly authorizes each State to decide whether to disqualify many otherwise eligible aliens from State Medicaid.  Section 122 is a product of this authorization. Accordingly, title IV can give section 122 no special insulation from strict scrutiny review.  Thus, section 122 must be evaluated as any other State statute that classifies based on alienage, and it violates the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and New York State Constitutions insofar as it denies State Medicaid to otherwise eligible persons permanently residing in the United States under color of law and lawfully admitted permanent residents based on their status as aliens. </SPAN></P>

New York's high court held that it was error to grant plaintiffs the relief they sought. The ordinary meaning of the regulation was not difficult to determine. Furthermore, it was improper to allow individual plaintiffs to forestall their prosecutions by making disingenuous constitutional challenges to a regulation the violation of which, if proven, supplied only one possible element of the offenses with which they were charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner commenced a paternity proceeding against her former professor, respondent. Although blood tests revealed a 99.9 percent probability of paternity, the parties entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 516.

Ten years later, petitioner commenced the proceeding for a declaration of paternity, and an order increasing the child support. On respondent's motion, the hearing examiner dismissed the proceeding, concluding that it was barred by the terms of the agreement. The family court upheld dismissal of the petition, and petitioner appealed. The appellate court found that the family court's perfunctory approval of the agreement, without any determination as to its adequacy, failed to satisfy the requirements of N.Y. Fam. Ct.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A putative father may not invoke Family Court Act &sect; 516 to bar a mother from seeking additional child support where the parties entered into a support agreement that was approved by a court without regard for the child's needs, notwithstanding that the father has lived up to the agreement since it was executed.  The language of the statute is clear: a support agreement will be enforced &quot;only when&quot; a court has reviewed it and determined that adequate support for the child has been made.  The purpose of judicial scrutiny is to ensure that the needs of nonmarital children are adequately met and not contracted away by their mothers, whose interests may not always coincide with those of their children.  Accordingly, inasmuch as the court gave perfunctory approval of the parties' agreement, without any determination as to its adequacy, there was a failure to satisfy the requirements of the statute.  Moreover, although the mother voiced no objection to the agreement for over 10 years, her failure to object does not justify enforcement thereof.  Accordingly, the agreement is no bar to a paternity proceeding or the entry of an increased support order to meet the child's ongoing educational needs.  </SPAN></P>

In a proceeding in which petitioner mother sought a declaration of paternity and increased support from respondent, who alleged that a settlement agreement executed by the parties over 10 years earlier mandated dismissal of the petition pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 516, the Court of Appeals has no occasion to consider the constitutionality of the statute where it has determined that the agreement does not comply with the requirements of section 516.  The Court is bound by principles of judicial restraint not to decide constitutional questions unless their disposition is necessary to the appeal.  Because a compelling nonconstitutional ground resolves the present appeal, the Court refrains, at this time, from addressing the constitutional issues raised.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant gas pipeline company sought a declaratory judgment against respondent tax commissioner, challenging its status under N.Y.

The Appellate Division (New York) affirmed. Gas Pipeline Company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Gas pipeline company transported natural gas through New York to New England in pipes. Pumps within the state of New York used to transport the gas were powered by natural gas drawn off the line. The New York State Tax Department determined that gas pipeline company was a natural gas importer and owed $ 1.6 million in taxes under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 189. Gas pipeline company's declaratory judgment action challenged its status as a gas importer and challenged the facial constitutionality of N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 189. Gas pipeline company argued that &sect; 189 discriminated against interstate commerce and thus violated the Commerce Clause. The tax commissioner argued that the &sect; 189 tax complemented taxes imposed under other sections of the tax law. The appellate court found that the &sect; 189 tax was a valid compensatory tax. Gas pipeline company further argued that &sect; 189 imposed a malapportioned tax. The appellate court found that since the &sect; 189 import tax contained no credit for taxes assessed on the purchase of gas out-of-state, a double tax occurred and the statute crossed over from a permissible exercise of the state's taxing powers to an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Commerce Clause - Valid Compensatory Tax - Natural Gas Import Tax </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1.  Tax Law &sect; 189, which recaptures taxes on natural gas from end users who buy gas directly from out-of-State producers and avoid the taxes passed through by in-State utilities in the rates charged to customers, is a valid compensatory tax under the Commerce Clause.  The statute discriminates against interstate commerce by imposing a tax on the out-of-State purchase of gas consumed in New York, while not taxing in-State purchases of gas used in New York.  However, the tax rates imposed on consumers who purchase gas in-State are the same as those imposed on consumers who purchase gas elsewhere.  The tax is imposed on the same activity, viz., the use of natural gas in New York, and reflects the &quot;cost&quot; of gas purchased in New York by utility customers. Moreover, because the in-State taxes are imposed on a receipt tax basis, the &quot;pass-through&quot; taxes will never be less than the import tax on comparable volumes of gas.  While the &quot;pass-through&quot; taxes are franchise taxes and section 189 is an import tax, the taxable events are the sale of gas and the use of imported gas in New York.  The taxes are also mutually exclusive; the consumer either buys the gas in-State or imports it. Thus, the taxes cannot overlap.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Commerce Clause - Facial Unconstitutionality of Natural Gas Import Tax - Internal Inconsistency </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.  Tax Law &sect; 189, which recaptures taxes on natural gas from end users who buy gas directly from out-of-State producers and avoid the taxes passed through by in-State utilities in the rates charged to customers pursuant to Tax Law &sect; 186, is facially unconstitutional.  The taxes in question run afoul of the internal consistency test.  Internal consistency is preserved when the imposition of a tax identical to the one in question by every other State would add no burden to interstate commerce that intrastate commerce would not also bear.  However, if consumers buy gas in a State with a provision identical to Tax Law &sect; 186, whereby utilities selling gas to consumers pass along a franchise tax representing the amount of New York's gas tax levy, they would pay a &quot;pass-through&quot; tax even though they exported the gas to New York where it was consumed. Because section 189 contains no credit for taxes assessed on the purchase of gas out-of-State, a double tax occurs, and the statute crosses over from a permissible exercise of the State's taxing powers to an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Commerce Clause - Facial Unconstitutionality of Natural Gas Import Tax - Savings Clause </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3.  Tax Law &sect; 189, which recaptures taxes on natural gas from end users who buy gas directly from out-of-State producers and avoid the taxes passed through by in-State utilities in the rates charged to customers pursuant to Tax Law &sect; 186, is facially unconstitutional, and the constitutional flaw is not remedied by the statute's savings clause which permits the court to deem available any appropriate out-of-State credit.  While the savings provision would appear to remedy the flaw in section 189 by providing a credit for any double taxation, it is invalid because it requires the Court to define the parameters of the credit and the manner in which it will be implemented.  That, however, violates fundamental separation of powers principles, and would require the rewriting of the statute and creation of quasi-judicial tax regulations, a task for which the Court is not institutionally well suited.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found to be a delinquent in a juvenile delinquency petition for an act constituting false personation in violation of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of his arrest, appellant, who was 14 years of age, gave a false name, age and address. He continued to lie after being warned by a police officer that he would face additional charges if he gave false information. Appellant was originally charged with acts constituting the unauthorized use of a vehicle, and false personation in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 165.05(1), 190.23. The unauthorized use of a vehicle charge was subsequently dismissed. The issue before the appellate court was whether N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 190.23 was void for vagueness. The appellate court found that (1) the statute prohibited specific conduct, and (2) the statute was not subject to arbitrary enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 190.23, which provides that &quot;[a] person is guilty of false personation when after being informed of the consequences of such act, he or she knowingly misrepresents his or her actual name, date of birth or address to a police officer or peace officer with intent to prevent such [officer] from ascertaining such information,&quot; is not void for vagueness on the ground that it fails to spell out the meaning of the requirement that people be informed of the &quot;consequences&quot; of lying to the police.  A statute is unconstitutionally vague if it fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence with a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, and it is written in a manner that permits or encourages arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. Penal Law &sect; 190.23 makes a person aware of what conduct is specifically prohibited.  Moreover, the term &quot;consequences&quot; in the statute clearly means that, for the statute to apply, the officer must first inform the defendant that giving false pedigree information subjects a person to criminal liability. The term thus has a limited meaning and is not subject to arbitrary enforcement.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to first degree sexual abuse, the maximum sentence for which was seven years. The prosecutor then subsequently sought to have defendant sentenced as a persistent felony offender, which would increase his sentence beyond the maximum seven years. The trial court gave defendant an opportunity to recant his plea and explained that if defendant chose to retain the plea and were adjudicated a persistent felon, the court would consider the prosecutor's application and enhance the sentence. Defendant insisted on specific performance of the plea agreement, after which the court vacated the plea and sent the matter to trial. The trial court concluded defendant was a persistent felony offender based on two prior felony convictions and sentenced him to 25 years to life on the first-degree sexual abuse count and one year on the endangering the welfare of a child count. The Court of Appeals held defendant had no constitutional right to a jury trial to establish the facts of his prior felony convictions.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant's argument that discretionary persistent felony offender sentence enhancement provisions violate his right to trial by jury does not constitute a mode of proceedings error reviewable absent timely objection. While all factual determinations which may enhance a sentence must be submitted to a jury, prior felony convictions need not be.  Under the statutory framework for enhancing sentences, prior felony convictions are the sole determinate of whether a defendant is subject to enhanced sentencing as a persistent felony offender. Although the court must consider other factors, that consideration is only part of its traditional role in ascertaining an appropriate sentence. Defendant has no constitutional right to a jury trial to establish the facts of his prior felony convictions. Accordingly, there was no mode of proceedings error in defendant's prosecution and, thus, any alleged error required preservation. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an action to recover damages for injuries plaintiff allegedly sustained after falling off of bleachers that lacked handrails, the trial court erred in determining as a matter of law that defendants' violation of Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 27-531 (a) (8) (d), which requires protective guards at the open ends of bleacher seating, constituted negligence per se.  Section 27-531 (a) (8) (d) was enacted as a local law and then designated as a section of the Administrative Code.  As a rule, the violation of a State statute that imposes a specific duty constitutes negligence per se, or may even create absolute liability, whereas the violation of a municipal ordinance constitutes only evidence of negligence. The elevation of a violation of an ordinance, or an administrative rule or regulation, to a negligence per se standard would substantially recast the common law of the State.  The specific nature of the duty imposed in Administrative Code &sect; 27-531 (a) (8) (d) does not ameliorate the concern that only the Legislature can alter the State common law of negligence.  Since the City retains the authority to amend or repeal its Administrative Code provisions, including section 27-531, without the need of State legislative action, the status of section 27-531 will not be transformed from that of a local enactment to a State statute.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A rational basis exists for the judicial salary disparities between Monroe County Family Court Judges on one hand and Suffolk County Family Court Judges and Putnam County multi-bench Judges on the other.  Therefore, the disparities do not violate equal protection and are constitutional.  Putnam County Judges' multiple roles give rise to distinctions in their jurisdiction, authority, duties and caseloads, thereby precluding a determination of true unity of judicial interest in the compared posts.  In addition, the Monroe County Judges proffered no proof that the costs of living in Monroe and Suffolk Counties are comparable and, thus, failed to demonstrate a true unity of judicial interest indistinguishable by separate geographic considerations.  Accordingly, plaintiffs did not meet their threshold burden of demonstrating that they and the Judges from Putnam and Suffolk Counties were similarly situated for equal protection analysis.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judges - Judicial Salaries - Pay Disparity - Equal Protection - Rational Basis - Monroe and Sullivan County Family Court Judges </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In an action challenging the disparities in judicial salaries between Monroe and Sullivan County Family Court Judges, the State defendants submitted 1990 U.S. Census data from the 1996 New York State Statistical Yearbook (21st rev ed) demonstrating that median home values were approximately 3% higher in Sullivan County than in Monroe County--$ 93,400 to $ 90,700.  The salary of a Family Court Judge in Sullivan County has been approximately 1% higher than plaintiffs' salaries since October 1987 and has never been more than 1.96% higher than plaintiffs' salaries (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judiciary Law &sect;&sect; 221-d, 221-e).  Therefore, the data illustrating the difference in median home values alone may provide a rational basis for the salary disparity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence - Judicial Notice - Consideration of Data for First Time on Appeal </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In an action challenging the disparities in judicial salaries between Monroe and Sullivan County Family Court Judges, census data from the State Statistical Yearbook submitted by defendants, which was relied upon in prior judicial salary cases, is a proper subject of judicial notice because it is taken from public records. Moreover, because this data reflects a legislative fact, as opposed to an evidentiary fact, its absence from the record does not prevent its consideration for the first time on appeal.  The data is not subject to dispute or courtroom factfinding; indeed, any effort to induce the Court of Appeals to utilize evidentiary facts to counteract arguable legislative assumptions would violate the rule that a legislative choice is not subject to courtroom factfinding. Accordingly, the census data is properly before the Court and provides a rational basis for the challenged statutes (Judiciary Law &sect;&sect; 221-d, 221-e).  Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy their heavy burden of proving that no reasonably conceivable state of facts supports the salary disparity. </SPAN></P>

Appellate Division (New York) entered order affirming defendant's conviction. Defendant was granted leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant took his computer to a repair shop and a technician noticed child pornography files. Defendant had a master's degree in social work, was a certified social worker, and had extensive experience in treating victims and offenders of child abuse. The deputy commissioner of mental health for the county invited him to join a work group to develop a treatment program for persons convicted of child pornography crimes. Defendant testified that he possessed the child pornography for scientific research on developing treatment for such persons. Section 263.16 was not overbroad as applied to defendant, since the State had a compelling interest in protecting children. The New York statutory scheme, which treated the offenses under &sect; 263.16 and N.Y. Penal Law art. 235 differently, only needed to be supported by some rational basis to survive constitutional scrutiny. There was nothing in Penal Law &sect;263.00(4) that supported defendant's interpretation of the statute as allowing the possession of the prohibited material. Thus the mistake of law defense in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 15.20(2)(a) was not available to him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Possessing Sexual Performance by Child - Absence of &quot;Scientific&quot; Defense Does Not Render Statute Unconstitutionally Overbroad - Compelling State Interest in Protecting Children </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a prosecution for possessing a sexual performance by a child ( Penal Law &sect; 263.16), defendant's First Amendment right of freedom of expression was not violated.  The absence of the affirmative defense that the persons to whom allegedly obscene or indecent material was disseminated, or the audience to an allegedly obscene performance, consisted of persons or institutions having scientific, educational, governmental or other similar justification for possessing, disseminating or viewing the material (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 235.15 [1]), does not render section 263.16 facially overbroad as applied to defendant, a certified social worker who claimed he possessed pictures of young children engaged in sexual activity with adults as part of his scientific research to develop treatment for persons transmitting child pornography on the Internet.  The First Amendment does not protect pornographic material involving children.  States enjoy greater latitude in regulating child pornography because of the government's compelling interest in safeguarding its children.  It is irrelevant to the child who has been abused that the material in question has a literary, artistic, political or social value.  Thus, the possible danger of infringement on serious literary, scientific, etc. works does not render the statute unconstitutional.  On its face, New York's child pornography statute is more narrowly drawn than a sister State law that was found constitutional by the United States Supreme Court.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Possessing Sexual Performance by Child - Absence of &quot;Scientific&quot; Defense Does Not Render Statute Unconstitutional Denial of Equal Protection - Compelling State Interest in Protecting Children </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a prosecution for possessing a sexual performance by a child ( Penal Law &sect; 263.16), defendant's rights to equal protection under the Federal and State constitutions was not violated.  The absence of the affirmative defense that the persons to whom allegedly obscene or indecent material was disseminated, or the audience to an allegedly obscene performance, consisted of persons or institutions having scientific, educational, governmental or other similar justification for possessing, disseminating or viewing the material (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 235.15 [1]), did not violate the equal protection rights of defendant, a certified social worker who claimed he possessed pictures of young children engaged in sexual activity with adults as part of his scientific research to develop treatment for persons transmitting child pornography on the Internet. Section 263.16 allegedly criminalizes possession of the same pornographic material that would otherwise be allowed under Penal Law article 235 if the pornography were classified as obscene. The statutory scheme, which treats the offenses differently, need only be supported by some rational basis to survive constitutional scrutiny.  The compelling State interest in eradicating child pornography and preventing child exploitation and abuse justifies the prohibition against child pornography. Because defendant has made no showing that the statutory scheme is irrational or contrary to public policy, the equal protection argument must fail.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Possessing Sexual Performance by Child - Mistake of Law Defense - Possession of Child Pornography for Scientific Purpose - Belief That Digital Computer Image Not Photograph </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a prosecution for possession of a sexual performance by a child ( Penal Law &sect; 263.16), the trial court properly refused to permit defendant, a certified social worker who claimed he possessed pictures of young children engaged in sexual activity with adults as part of his scientific research to develop treatment for persons transmitting child pornography on the Internet, to present a mistake of law defense (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 15.20 [2] [a]).  Penal Law article 263 does not authorize one to possess images on a computer hard drive of children engaged in sexual activity, if those images are not displayed to an audience, on the theory that the images technically were not photographs or other visual representations exhibited before an audience. Rather than showing that there was an official statement of the law contained in a statute authorizing his conduct, defendant maintains that a digital computer image is not a photograph within the meaning of Penal Law &sect; 263.00 (4), which defines sexual &quot;performance&quot; as, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> any visual representation exhibited before an audience. Defendant does not show that he relied on an official publication in construing the statute incorrectly.  Thus, there is nothing in section 263.00 (4) that would support his interpretation of the statute as allowing the possession of the prohibited material.  Accordingly, defendant only thought that the statutory exemptions permitted his conduct when, in fact, the primary statute clearly forbade his conduct.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Possessing Sexual Performance by Child - Digital Computer Images as &quot;Photographs&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a prosecution for possession of a sexual performance by a child ( Penal Law &sect; 263.16), computer graphic images may be considered &quot;photographs&quot; within the meaning of Penal Law &sect; 263.00 (4), which defines sexual &quot;performance.&quot; It cannot be said that computer graphic files containing images of children less than 16 years of age engaged in sexual conduct do not fall within the purview of the statute, on the theory that computer graphic images are not &quot;photographs,&quot; or that they do not constitute an &quot;other visual representation&quot; because defendant did not &quot;exhibit before an audience&quot; the prohibited material ( Penal Law &sect; 263.00 [4]).  Such a narrow reading of the statute does not comport with reasonable interpretation.  By enacting Penal Law article 263, the Legislature intended to employ broad measures to eradicate child pornography in all its forms.  Consistent with that expressed intent, the graphic images stored in defendant's computer were either photographs that were converted to digital images by a scanner or taken by a digital camera.  Defining digital computer images as photographs falls within the plain and natural meaning of the statute and gives effect to the objects of the law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed the order granting defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York). Plaintiffs appealed denial of their motion for summary judgment based on lack of notice under U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant town, dismissing plaintiffs' claim that defendant towns failed to give proper notice under U.S. Const. amend. XIV for a special assessment of fees on plaintiffs' property. The trial court held that defendant town violated Dover, N.Y., Town Law &sect; 239 by failing to hold a hearing prior to the assessment but that defendant adjoining town held the hearing and gave notice via a local newspaper. Also, the assessment did not constitute a divestiture of plaintiffs' title. The court found that plaintiffs were entitled to notice prior to the enactment of any special assessment, reasoning that where the interest of a property owner was substantially affected by an act of government, due process required that actual notice be given. Further, the court reasoned that a special assessment was no different than a tax sale or condemnation case and an owner was entitled to notice and a hearing prior to the assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting defendant town's cross motion for summary judgment was reversed and the motion denied. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment was granted because plaintiffs never had the opportunity to object to a special assessment due to the fact that plaintiffs never received prior notice of a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Plaintiff, an out-of-State landowner, was deprived of due process by defendant town's notice by publication in a local newspaper of a special assessment, since plaintiff's interest as a property owner was substantially affected by the government action, and its name and address were known.  Although defendant town complied with Town Law &sect; 239, which only provides for notice by publication, compliance with this statute under the circumstances was inadequate to satisfy due process requirements.  The opportunity to appear and object at the hearing provided for under section 239 is crucial: unless a property owner appears and objects to the proposed assessment, the owner will be forever barred from challenging the levy and will be responsible for paying the costs imposed.  An objector has only 30 days from the date the special assessment is finalized to challenge it, and a failure to challenge would eventually result in a lien imposed upon the land.  The right to appear and object is meaningless unless the property owner has notice that is reasonably calculated to apprise it of the proceeding.  Significantly, the names and addresses of the affected landowners were indisputably known to defendant town because they appear on the special assessment roll, and there was no showing of other compelling or persuasive reasons, economic or otherwise, why direct notice could not be given.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Assessment - Notice to Taxpayer - Notice by Publication - Constitutional Requirement of Actual Notice - Due Process - Taxpayer's Knowledge of Prior Assessments </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Where the interest of a property owner will be substantially affected by an act of government, and where the owner's name and address are known, due process requires that actual notice be given.  Plaintiff, an out-of-State landowner, was deprived of due process by defendant town's notice by publication in a local newspaper of a special assessment, and plaintiff may not be charged with knowledge of one year's assessment by virtue of its challenge to the prior year's assessment.  The required hearings were not held for the prior year's assessments, and it was only after the imposition of the prior special assessment that plaintiff challenged its validity.  Even with knowledge of a previous year's special assessment, plaintiff had no way of knowing whether the subsequent levy would be substantially different from the year before.  Without notice, plaintiff never had the opportunity to object to the methodology employed in imposing the subsequent assessment and should not be compelled to rely on an earlier experience.  The continuing nature of defendant's obligation under article 15 of the Town Law should not deprive plaintiff of its entitlement to receive actual notice of the scheduled hearing to consider the challenged special assessment, and an opportunity to attend and be heard.  </SPAN></P>
