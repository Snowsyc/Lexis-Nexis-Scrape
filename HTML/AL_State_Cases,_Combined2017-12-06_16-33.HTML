Code &sect; 36-27-1(14)'s term &quot;earnable compensation&quot; as the salary an individual was normally entitled to receive, which by definition did not include overtime; [2]-No vested contract rights afforded the members by Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 were violated because no statute was amended to their detriment; rather, they objected only to a change in an administrative interpretation of a statute, and ERSA's longtime erroneous interpretation of &sect; 36-27-1(14) did not bind the State in any respect.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-It erred in finding the State had selectively enforced the gambling laws in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, as its selective-prosecution finding conflicted with cases decided by the State's high court, and it applied the wrong legal standard, as gambling was not a fundamental right and there was no allegation of purposeful discrimination; [3]-Its interrogation of the State about its enforcement was an intrusion into the executive branch's discretionary functions that violated the separation of powers; [3]-It erred by  finding that voters, in approving a constitutional amendment allowing bingo, meant to include electronic bingo; [4]-Under the high court's precedent, the amendment allowing &quot;bingo&quot; meant traditional bingo.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 36.03, as there was a need for immediate uniform relief, the magnitude and importance of the issue was unparalleled, and no other court could provide statewide relief; [2]-The same-sex marriage prohibition did not violate substantive due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV because under a rational basis analysis, offering marriage solely to heterosexuals served to prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and there was no animus shown; [3]-There was also no violation of equal protection because there was a rational basis by recognizing and encouraging ties between children and biological parents.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 1-1-16 because using severability to save the act was not permissible where it was obvious that the legislature excluded the three counties for no rational reason and to edit the act by severing that language excluding the three counties would be to undermine the clear intent of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The trial court properly denied the doctor's motion for relief from judgment because, given the conflicting evidence, the doctor failed to meet his burden of proving extraordinary circumstances and/or extreme hardship or injustice sufficient to entitle him to relief under Ala. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). The record reflected that the trial court considered conflicting affidavits concerning the extent of the doctor's treatment of the juror's husband and whether the juror had ever spoken disparagingly about the doctor at any time; [2]-The judgment was reversed as to the issue of remittitur because, at the time of the Hammond/Green Oil hearing, the third-party action had not yet accrued and was speculative in nature. Thus, it could not be considered as part of the doctor's net worth in determining his assets for purposes of Hammond/Green Oil and the remittitur analysis.</SPAN></P>

It was a franchisee licensed for the beneficial purpose of participating with other health-care providers in Alabama, both public and private, in rendering health-care services to citizens of Alabama. As a health-care authority organized and operating under the Alabama Health Care Authorities Act of 1982, Ala. Code &sect; 22-21-310 et seq., defendant was neither a county nor a municipality; therefore, the statutory cap on liability set forth in Ala. Code  &sect; 11-93-2 did not apply to defendant by operation of Ala. Code &sect; 22-21-318(a)(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a class action complaint against defendants, the board of directors of the Alabama Prepaid Affordable College Tuition (PACT) program. Objecting class members challenged a judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which approved a settlement agreement and concluded that the retroactivity provision of 2012 Ala. Acts 198, &sect; 4 was constitutional. The 2012 Act specifically repealed Ala. Code &sect; 16-33C-19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the 2012 Act removed &sect; 16-33C-19 as a basis on which to challenge the trial court's approval of the settlement agreement. It upheld the trial court's ruling that the retroactive application of the 2012 Act was constitutional. While the Act removed certain prohibitions on the actions of the PACT board, the legislation itself neither diminished, removed, or impaired any contractual rights or obligations, vested or not, nor mandated any particular result in violation of Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. It was the settlement agreement that altered the rights found in the PACT contracts, not the 2012 Act. Because the briefs on return to remand did not explain how &sect; 16-33C-19 constituted an &quot;existing defense&quot; under Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 95, and no authority in support of the argument was presented, the argument was waived pursuant to Ala. R. App. P. 28(a)(10). The trial court did not exceed its discretion in holding that the settlement agreement was fair, adequate, and reasonable. The award guaranteed to each class member under the terms of the settlement agreement likely exceeded the reward the class members would receive if they were successful at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The execution of the warrant having been accomplished, the court removed the seal from its order, and addressed the reasons for issuing the writ. The court found that the special agent's affidavit submitted with the State's petition and the judge's submissions indicated that the decision not to issue the warrant was premised on numerous grounds that were in error and that were extrinsic to a proper determination of probable cause since: (1) reliance upon another public official's opinion as to what was and what was not a crime under applicable law was an erroneous ground for denying a search warrant; and (2) the information publicly declared on television, upon which the judge professed reliance, was not properly before him in the case. Contrary to the judge's conclusion and the various erroneous legal grounds upon which he based that conclusion, the circumstances presented allowed for no reasonable conclusion other than that probable cause existed for the issuance of the search warrant. Therefore, the judge exceeded his discretion under Ala. R. Crim. P. 3.7 in denying the search warrant. The State was entitled to an order directing the judge to issue the requested warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jail administrator sued a former correctional officer, inmate one and inmate two (inmates) alleging various torts. The inmates counterclaimed against the administrator, a sheriff, in her official and individual capacities, and the Clay County Commission (Commission) raising a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. The inmates appealed the dismissal by the Clay Circuit Court of their claims against the sheriff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that the sheriff was properly named as a counterclaim defendant under Ala. R. Civ.

The inmates were convicted felons, rather than pretrial detainees, for part of the relevant period and could raise Eighth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VIII, claims against the sheriff. The &sect; 1983 claim alleged a causal connection between the sheriff's failure to  address the alleged ongoing sexual assault of inmates, and the alleged violations of the inmates' Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, rights. The sheriff could be held vicariously liable for the alleged violations. The sheriff had immunity under Ala. Const. art. V, &sect; 112 against the state-law claims against her and Eleventh Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XI, immunity against the federal claims against her in her official capacity. The sheriff did not have federal qualified immunity against the federal claims against her in her individual capacity. The inmates alleged that the sheriff's failure to take action deprived them of their Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed insofar as it dismissed the federal claims against the sheriff in her official capacity or the state-law claims against her in both her official and individual capacities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee alleged he was discharged without due process. He argued that his request for reinstatement was a claim for equitable relief excepted from the bar of immunity. The high court held that as he failed to overcome the presumption that he was an at-will employee, he was not entitled to the due-process rights afforded staff employees under their employee handbook. As he was not entitled to any due process, petitioners did not act in bad faith, beyond their authority, or in a mistaken interpretation of law; therefore, they were entitled to summary judgment as to the employee's claim for injunctive relief asserted against them in both their individual and official capacities. Petitioner one was entitled to state-agent immunity on the fraud claim asserted against him in his individual capacity, as the employee failed to establish that petitioner  intentionally misled him by assuring him that his position was secure. As the employee presented no argument or evidence in opposition to petitioner two's summary judgment motion seeking state-agent immunity on the malice claim asserted against him in his individual capacity, petitioner was entitled to summary judgment on that claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One defendant tested positive for cocaine prior to giving birth and the child tested positive for cocaine after birth. The other defendant gave birth to a son who died soon thereafter. A medical examiner with the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences performed an autopsy and determined the child died from acute methamphetamine intoxication. The Supreme Court of Alabama held that the plain meaning of the word &quot;child&quot; was broad enough to encompass all children, born and unborn, including both defendants' unborn children. The term &quot;child&quot; in &sect; 26-15-3.2 was unambiguous. Thus, the Court had to interpret the plain language of the statute to mean exactly what it said and not engage in judicial construction of the language in the statute. Also, because the statute was unambiguous, the rule of lenity did not apply. The Court did not see any rational basis for concluding that the plain and ordinary meaning of the term &quot;child&quot; did not include a viable fetus. The Court rejected the lower courts' reasoning insofar as it limited the application of the chemical-endangerment statute to a viable unborn child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the patient died as a result of aspiration pneumonitis, the administratrix sued the defendants for wrongful death. At the conclusion of the case, the jury awarded the administratrix punitive damages. The trial court thereafter entered a judgment in the administratrix's favor in a reduced amount. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that although a large number of jurors did not disclose their complete litigation history during voir dire, the trial court did not exceed its discretion in concluding both that the cause of the failures to respond was misunderstanding of the questions posed and that no probable prejudice resulted. The application of punitive damages under Alabama's wrongful-death statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 6-11-27(a), did not deny the defendants rights to due process and equal protection of the law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ala. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6 and 13. In addition, there was no indication that the trial court erred in determining the amount of the remittitur.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, a state university president, and the individual members of the university's board of trustees (respondents), in their official capacities, appealed an order entered by the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which granted petitioner employee's petition for a writ of mandamus and declaratory relief as a result of the termination of her employment with the university and awarded the employee full backpay and benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that the respondents were immune from any claim for monetary damages under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. Thus, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the employee's claim for backpay and benefits, and the trial court's order was void to the extent it purported to award backpay and benefits to the employee. The appeal was dismissed as to the portion of the trial court's order awarding the employee backpay and benefits, and that portion of the trial court's order was vacated. The respondents' claim that it was error to grant the employee's petition for a writ of mandamus and declaratory relief was rejected as it was not supported with authority that the harmless-error rule applied to their failure to comply with the procedures set forth in the university handbook The respondents' harmless error claim did not comply with Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sued appellee officials, seeking a declaration that Ala. Code &sect; 29-2-123, and 2004 Ala. Acts 456 insofar as it appropriated money to fund community-services grants, were unconstitutional. After an earlier appeal which resulted in a decision in favor of the taxpayer and remand, the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) awarded the taxpayer attorney fees and costs. The officials brought four proceedings seeking review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officials argued that an award of attorney fees and expenses to be paid by the State to a successful litigant under the common-benefit doctrine in a declaratory-judgment action violated Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. The appellate court agreed. Although the taxpayer argued that the award should have been upheld on grounds of public policy, the determination of public policy of states resided, first, with the people as expressed in their Constitution and, second, with the representatives of the people-the state legislature. Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 enshrined the public-policy considerations of the people of Alabama, and the appellate court was bound thereby. Public policy considerations did not override constitutional mandates. Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 barred an award of attorney fees and costs even if a plaintiff prevailed on a claim against State officials in their official capacities for a violation of the State Constitution that resulted in preservation of significant funds in the State treasury. The trial court lacked authority to award such attorney fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the petition for the writ of mandamus was dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the State Director of Finance and the State Comptroller, challenged an order of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which granted plaintiff associations' a preliminary injunction in their action to force the Comptroller to resume the previous practice of executing salary deductions. The associations moved to vacate the injunction and to remand the case to the circuit court after the legislature amended Ala. Code &sect; 17-17-5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Comptroller based changes in the manner of executing salary deductions on his interpretation of Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 36-12-61 and 17-17-5. The supreme court held that the claims the associations presented in their action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief were moot. The action challenged the practices adopted by the Finance Director and the Comptroller based on their interpretation of Alabama statutory law as it existed before the act amending &sect; 17-17-5 became effective, 2010 Ala. Acts 2010-761. The Act explicitly stated a rule that encompassed those practices. Unavoidably, therefore, the action had to be considered moot. By its terms, the Act clearly prohibited the Comptroller from executing salary deductions that contribute directly or indirectly to political-action committees. No claims were made seeking the return of any moneys the Comptroller refused to deduct in the past, and the Act plainly foreclosed the prospective declaratory and injunctive relief specifically requested by the associations. Because the action was moot as a result of a change in the law, it followed that the basis for the circuit court's preliminary injunction no longer existed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court vacated the circuit court's preliminary-injunction order and remanded the case for the circuit court to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Disciplinary Board of the Alabama State Bar Association determined that an attorney who had been convicted of violating 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 371 and 641, both misdemeanors, had been convicted of a &quot;serious crime&quot; for purposes of Ala. R. Disc. P. 22(a)(2). The attorney appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney and his client, a sheriff who contested an election, used sheriff's office employees to access the National Crime Information Center database to obtain criminal records of persons who voted by absentee ballot. The attorney was convicted of violating &sect; 641, para. 2 and conspiring to violate it (&sect; 371). As the value of the property converted was less than $1,000, the &sect; 641 conviction was of a misdemeanor. The Board found the &sect; 641 violation was a &quot;serious crime&quot; as defined by Ala. R. Disc. P. 8(c)(2)(C) and the &sect; 371 violation was a serious crime under Rule 8(c)(2)(D). The high court held that as the attorney's &sect; 641, para. 2 conviction was based on his receiving the records with the intent to convert them, not his actual subsequent use or conversion of them, &quot;misappropriation&quot; was not a necessary element of that crime; therefore, he was not convicted of a &quot;serious crime&quot; as defined in Rule 8(c)(2)(C). In finding that the &sect; 371 conviction constituted a &quot;serious crime&quot; under Rule 8(c)(2)(D), the Board erred in limiting its analysis to the necessary elements of that offense and not considering the facts supporting and the circumstances surrounding the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board's findings that the convictions of violating &sect;&sect; 371 and 641 were serious crimes were reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings as to the &sect; 371 conviction.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 16-33C-19, barred the PACT board from violating the contracts, and (3) the objectors did not consent to a contract modification or waive any statutory rights, so the settlement exceeded Ala. Code &sect; 16-33C-19's limit on the PACT board's authority. It was not a mutual compromise because (1) the objectors could not opt out of this Ala. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) class, and (2) its approval by most class members did not let the PACT board trump statutory limits on its power or contract holders' statutory rights. Ala. Code &sect; 19-3B-412, letting a court modify a trust, did not let the trial court approve the settlement because (1) Ala. Code &sect; 16-33C-19 superseded a contrary general statute, and (2) neither the PACT board, under that statute, nor the court, under Ala. Const. art. III, &sect; 43, could ignore the statute. The entire settlement had to be vacated because the objectors could not opt out of the class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A worker sued a contractor, alleging its wantonness caused his injury. The trial court granted the contractor's motion for summary judgment, finding the suit was time-barred. The worker appealed. The Alabama Court of Civil Appeals reversed, finding that the worker's wantonness claim was governed by Ala. Code &sect; 6-2-34(1)'s six-year statute of limitations. The contractor filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reversing the trial court's judgment, the intermediate appellate court relied on McKenzie v. Killian, 887 So. 2d 861 (Ala. 2004), in which the state's high court had held that a claim of wanton misconduct was subject to the six-year statute of limitations found in &sect; 6-2-34(1), rather than the two-year statute of limitations found in Ala. Code &sect; 6-2-38(l). The high court overruled McKenzie and held that tort claims based on allegations of wanton misconduct were subject to the two-year statute of limitations found in &sect; 6-2-38(l). Based on equitable considerations, it declined to impose this new rule retroactively. For litigants for whom the six-year limitations period announced in McKenzie would, under the rule announced in the instant case, expire on a date less than two years from June 3, 2011 (the date of the instant decision), the limitations period was not affected by the holding in the instant case. Litigants whose causes of action accrued on or before June 3, 2011, had two years from that date to bring their action, unless and to the extent that the time for filing their action under the six-year limitations period announced in McKenzie would expire sooner.</SPAN></P>

He sought a writ of mandamus, alleging that in his capacity as a warden, he was a deputy sheriff who was entitled to immunity. The court noted that as warden of the county jail, he did everything a deputy sheriff did as well as everything a jail administrator did. Further, he was acting as a deputy sheriff at the time of the incident, which was considered the alter ego of the sheriff. As the sheriff was a constitutional officer pursuant to Ala. Const. art.

Code &sect; 27-42-11(e), seeking to recover money it had paid on behalf of the board on a workers' compensation claim filed by one of its employees. The board challenged a judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals (Alabama), which reversed a circuit court's order granting its motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">AIGA determined that the board was a high-net-worth insured for the purposes of the AIGA Act and sent it a demand for reimbursement pursuant to &sect; 27-42-11. The Board refused to reimburse AIGA, arguing that the statute of limitations on its claim had run. The circuit court entered a judgment limiting AIGA's recovery to the payments it had made on the workers' compensation claim during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the action. The court of civil appeal concluded that AIGA's claims were subject to a six-year statute of limitations under Ala. Code &sect; 6-2-34 and that, therefore, the circuit court had erred in limiting AIGA's recovery to payments made within two years of the filing of the action. The supreme court held that the circuit court erred in limiting AIGA's right to reimbursement to the payments it made in the two years immediately prior to the filing of the underlying action. a six-year statute of limitations applies to AIGA's claim. AIGA's right to reimbursement was a statutory right permitting the recovery of a liquidated sum. Therefore, AIGA's claims related to that right fall within the purview of &sect; 6-2-34(5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the judgment of the court of civil appeals reversing the circuit court's judgment and remanding the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother brought an action against defendant school officials, a county board of education, individual board members, the superintendent, the principal, and the assistant principal, after her son was suspended for fighting. The mother sought damages and injunctive relief, alleging both state and federal law claims. The Colbert Circuit Court (Alabama) granted the mother's motion for a preliminary injunction. The school officials appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assistant principal suspended two students for three days for allegedly fighting on school property during school hours. He also required each of the suspended students to attend an alternative school for 15 days at the beginning of the following academic school year. With regard to the state law claims against the board and its members in their official capacities, the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the board was entitled to absolute immunity, and the members were entitled to qualified immunity, under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. Furthermore, the trial court erred in entering the preliminary injunction without any evidence in support of its issuance, relying solely on the mother's complaint and her unverified motion requesting injunctive relief. Although the trial court indicated that it was relying upon its consideration of the evidence and submissions, there was nothing in the record to indicate that any evidence had been presented when it entered the preliminary injunction. Some type of evidence which substantiated the pleadings was implicitly required by Ala. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction insofar as it applied to the state law claims against the board, the claims seeking monetary damages against the individual board members in their official capacities, and the entry of the preliminary injunction based upon state law claims. The court reversed that portion of the judgment which entered the preliminary injunction, and it remanded the cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, students and former students of three universities, filed three separate class-action lawsuits challenging the legality of the dining-dollars program pursuant to Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 6-5-60, 16-1-32(d), and Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 93. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) granted defendant food-service vendors' Ala. R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the program, all undergraduate students were required to pay a dining fee each semester, which was then credited back to the students in the form of dining-dollars that could be spent only at on-campus dining outlets controlled exclusively by defendant food-services vendors. As against defendant university boards of trustees, the claim for money damages was barred by sovereign immunity pursuant to Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. The boards of trustees were considered the State for purposes of &sect; 14 state immunity, while nevertheless maintaining a status distinct from the State for Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 93 purposes because they were organized as public corporations. Section 93 did not apply to public corporations. Defendant university administrators were entitled to immunity with regard to the Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-60 antitrust claims under the state-action-immunity doctrine. Also, the food-service vendors were entitled to state-action-immunity because it was foreseeable that the universities would require some form of mandated meal plan for students under an exclusive management contract. Finally, the students lacked standing to bring an action for a violation of Ala. Code &sect; 16-1-32.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A tenant petitioned for a writ of certiorari to review an order of the Court of Civil Appeals (Alabama), which granted a landlord's writ of mandamus petition directing a circuit court to dismiss her appeal as untimely. The writ was issued to consider whether the circuit court of appeals erred in ruling that &quot;seven days&quot; in Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 6-6-350 and 35-9A-461(d) meant seven calendar days and that Ala. R. Civ. P. 6(a) did not apply to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord filed an unlawful-detainer complaint against the tenant. A district court rendered a judgment in its favor. The tenant filed a notice of appeal to the circuit court. The landlord moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the notice of appeal was untimely. The circuit court denied the motion. The landlord filed a petition for a writ of mandamus. The supreme court held that the court of civil appeals erred in granting the landlord's petition for a writ of mandamus. Rule 6(a) applied to the computation of the time for filing the appeal to the circuit court from the adverse judgment in the unlawful-detainer action in the district court. Section 35-9A-461(a) specifically provided that actions by residential landlords relating to a tenancy had to be governed by the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure and the Alabama Rules of Appellate Procedure except as modified by that chapter. It did not modify or exempt such actions from the application of Rule 6(a). Under Rule 6(a), the tenant timely filed her notice of appeal. Consequently, the circuit court properly denied the landlord's motion to dismiss her appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the judgment of the court civil of appeals and remanded the case with instructions that the court of civil appeals quash the writ it issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation consolidated approximately 1,800 cases involving claims seeking damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by exposure to welding fumes. Dozens of the cases were governed by Alabama law, and the multi-district litigation court, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, certified three questions of Alabama law under Ala. R. App. P. 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first question certified was whether, in a case where the plaintiff sought damages for injuries cause by long-term continuous exposure to an allegedly toxic substance, Alabama law limited the plaintiff to recovery of damages for only those injuries that occurred within the limitations period. The court answered that a plaintiff injured by long-term continuous exposure to a toxic substance was limited to recovering damages attributable to injuries occurring within the period of limitations. The second certified question concerned the application of recent caselaw to a wantonness claim. The court answered by stating that a six-year limitations period of Ala. Code &sect; 6-2-34(1) applied to wantonness claims filed before Ex parte Capstone Building Corp. The third certified question involved the burden of proving which injuries occurred within the applicable limitations period. The court answered that a plaintiff injured by long-term continuous exposure to a toxic substance bore the burden of establishing what damages, if any, were attributable to injuries occurring within the limitations period as opposed to injuries occurring outside that limitations period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff candidates filed a verified complaint for injunctive relief against defendant City, challenging the results of city council and board of education elections. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) entered summary judgment in favor of the City. The candidates appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 11-46-5, a majority of a city council voted to adopt an ordinance to change the days of the general municipal elections and runoff elections. After the U.S. Justice Department precleared the ordinance, the City implemented the new election dates and elections were held. The candidates argued that by adopting the ordinance the City had unilaterally changed the Mayor-Council Act of 1955, 1955 Ala. Acts 452, without first petitioning the Alabama Legislature to amend the Act. However, by enacting and later amending Ala. Code &sect; 11-46-5, the legislature gave municipalities the authority, pursuant to &sect; 11-46-5, to choose to vary from the election dates established in the Mayor-Council Act. Further, although Ala. Code &sect; 11-46-20 did not require Class 1 municipalities, such as the City, to conduct elections in accordance with Ala. Code tit. 11, ch. 46, art. 2, it did not prohibit them from choosing to do so in accordance with Ala. Code &sect; 11-46-5. The City complied with the plain language of &sect; 11-46-5 when it changed the dates for its general municipal elections and runoff elections. Accordingly, the trial court properly entered a summary judgment for the City.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents of minor children challenged the appellate court's decision upholding the Alabama Grandparent Visitation Act (Act), Ala. Code &sect; 30-3-4.1, against a constitutional challenge. The supreme court affirmed, but on a different rationale. The trial court awarded the grandparents visitation based on the best-interests-of-the-child standard in the Act. The appellate court held that, although the Act was not unconstitutional on its face, it was unconstitutional as applied to the parents because the grandparents were awarded visitation without a showing of harm to the children caused by denying the grandparents visitation. The supreme court declared the Act unconstitutional in its entirety, because it clearly and unmistakably came within the inhibition of the constitution. The failure of the Act to include a presumption in favor of the parents when deciding questions of visitation infringed on the constitutional right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children, and the Act was therefore fatally flawed and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Director argued that counts III and IV of the complaint, alleging unjust enrichment and unlawful taking and seeking money damages, were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity under Ala.

Although respondents' action alleging the Director overcharged them based on a misinterpretation or willful misapplication of the law was not necessarily barred by sovereign immunity, a judgment in respondents' favor would affect the financial status of the state treasury, and, thus, the action for money damages could not be maintained. Accordingly, to the extent that respondents' action sought money damages from the State, it was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed an action against defendant county, contending that 2009 Ala. Acts 811 was unconstitutional because the notice requirements of Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 106 were violated. The county challenged an order of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which denied its motion for summary judgment and entered a summary judgment for the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor, acting pursuant to Ala. Const. art. V, &sect; 122, called the legislature into an &quot;extraordinary session,&quot; The 2009 Act was enacted during the session.  The official legislative records contained a notice presented by representative for a house bill, which became the 2009 Act. It imposed occupation taxes. The supreme court held that the Governor's authority to call a special session pursuant to &sect; 122 did not affect the application of &sect; 106 to the enactment of laws that could be considered in that special session. The 2009 Act could have been properly noticed pursuant &sect; 106 within the time constraints for the special session called pursuant to &sect; 122. The supreme court concluded that the essential purpose of &sect; 106, that those affected be informed of the substance of the proposed local legislation, had not been met. The public was not properly informed by the notice that the taxes that were held invalid were to be reimposed. A comparison of the notice with the 2009 Act revealed a number of differences. The omission of the referendum provision or the retroactive-taxation provision from the notice sufficiently implicated the &quot;substance&quot; of the 2009 Act so as to violate &sect; 106.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff teacher filed an action against defendants, the Alabama Department of Education, state officers, a board of education, and members of the board, alleging that her pay raise under Ala. Code &sect; 16-22-13.1 had been miscalculated. The Department, officers, board, and members challenged a judgment entered for the teacher in the Jefferson Circuit Court, Bessemer Division (Alabama), arguing they were immune under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court treated the appeals as petitions for a writ of mandamus. It held that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to enter a judgment against the board. The board was an agency of the State and was entitled to absolute immunity. No exception to &sect; 14 immunity applied to the board itself. However, regarding the members in their official capacities, the teacher was entitled to bring an action to compel them to perform their legal duty or to perform a ministerial act. The members had a statutory duty to pay the teacher the appropriate salary increase under &sect; 16-22-13.1. The amount of the salary increase the members had to pay the teacher involved obedience to the statute. It did not involve any discretion. Therefore, the teacher's action against the members in their official capacities was not an action against the State for &sect; 14 purposes, and the members were not entitled to immunity. The Department, as an arm or agency of the State, was entitled to absolute immunity. The teacher could not sue the State indirectly by suing the individual State officers in their official capacities. Therefore, the individual State officers were entitled to immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court granted the petition for mandamus as to the board, the Department, and the officials and issued the writ directing the trial court to dismiss the teacher's claim against the them. It denied the petition for a writ of mandamus as to the board members in their official capacities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Alabama Declaratory Judgment Act, Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 6-6-220 through 6-6-232, a city sued defendants, a veterans club, a limited liability company (LLC), and a county sheriff, seeking a judgment declaring that a city ordinance was valid and that electronic, video, or machine bingo was lawful in the county. The St. Clair Circuit Court (Alabama) upheld the ordinance. The sheriff and intervenor district attorney and Governor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the club and LLC applied for permits to establish machine-bingo facilities, the city filed the instant suit, alleging that the sheriff believed that electronic, video, or machine bingo was illegal and planned to arrest any licensee that started up machine bingo operations under the city's ordinance. The high court noted that the city's complaint described merely anticipated conduct accompanied by a request, which assumed that the anticipated conduct would take place, for an advisory opinion as to the validity of the ordinance authorizing such conduct. While the Act allowed a court to declare the legal rights, status, and relations of parties, it did not empower courts to give advisory opinions. There existed only an anticipated controversy; there had been no damage or injury to the parties, nor had any legal rights been thwarted or affected. Thus, the city's lawsuit was nonjusticiable under the Act. Therefore, the trial court was without subject-matter jurisdiction; its judgment was void and could not support an appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizens filed an action against defendants, a trust, its director, and certain State officials (collectively, the State officials), alleging that a portion of 2009 La. Acts 768 allocating funds to the trust violated La. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 45 and 61. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) denied a motion for class certification, but granted a preliminary injunction. The State officials appealed, and the citizens cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to 2009 La. Acts 768, the citizens, who had all received traffic citations, paid twelve dollars as a DNA database fee, a portion of which was allocated to the trust. The citizens claimed that the allocation of a portion of the fee was unconstitutional. The trial court issued the preliminary injunction requiring the State officials to escrow all funds received by them pursuant to 2009 La. Acts 768. Because this was a civil proceeding collaterally attacking the judgments in criminal cases, it fell within the scope of Ala. R. Crim. P. 32. Accordingly, the appellate court had to treat the action as it would any other Rule 32 proceeding. Accordingly, with respect to two of the citizens, Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.1 required that the petitions be dismissed without prejudice. With respect to the third citizen, the criminal proceeding was still pending and, therefore, the trial court was without subject-matter jurisdiction to entertain the underlying action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order issuing the injunction, affirmed its order denying class certification, and dismissed the appeal as to one of the citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama issued a writ of mandamus in response to a petition filed by an inmate, whose Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition was pending in the trial court, directing the trial court to ensure that the inmate had access to certain demographic information he sought. The State sought review by filing a petition for a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate sought the demographic information on the race and gender of jurors in Tuscaloosa County from 1978 through 1995 in relation to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The clerk had produced the lists, but only two lists from 1995 contained information regarding the race and gender of the venire. Although the motion requested that the court order various agencies to produce information, the appellate court found that the order at issue required discovery only with regard to demographic information available from the Tuscaloosa County Board of Registrars (board). Earlier, an appellate court held that the inmate was entitled to the demographic information about the venires in question. It was undisputed that the board had in its records voter-registration applications that requested, and generally contained, information about gender and race. There was no reason why the trial court should not have been required to order that the voter-registration applications in the board's possession be made available to the inmate for his review. Although the trial court ordered the production of the venire lists, the inmate still needed the demographic information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Ala. Code &sect; 16-60-111.4, defendant State Board of Education adopted policies prohibiting the employment of State officials. Plaintiff legislators challenged the policies as conflicting with the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act (AAPA), Ala. Code &sect; 41-22-1 et seq., the Fair Dismissal Act, Ala. Code &sect; 36-26-100 et seq., and Ala. Code &sect; 17-1-4. On remand, the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) invalidated the policies. The Board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First, the trial court erred in concluding that the Board lacked authority under Ala. Code &sect; 16-60-111.4(1) to adopt the policies. By its plan language, &sect; 16-60-111.4(1) authorized the Board to make rules and regulations for the government of the two-year colleges. Second, the trial court erred in holding that the polices violate Ala. Code &sect; 17-1-4(a)(3) because the policies did not deny two-year college employees the right to participate in political activities. Third, the trial court erred in holding that the Board invaded the province of the legislature in violation of the separation of powers provision in Ala. Const. art. III, &sect; 43 because the trial court erred in concluding that the policies imposed a new qualification on the right to hold legislative office. Finally, the trial court erred in determining that the policies violated the Fair Dismissal Act, Ala. Code &sect; 36-26-100 et seq., because nothing in one policy related to the termination of any employee and under the other policy, the employee was entitled to choose to retain his or her employment or to give it up in favor of an elected State office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county planning and zoning commission sought certiorari review of an opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals (Alabama), which upheld a trial court's order granting a property owner's petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the commission to grant his application for a proposed residential subdivision and to declare Subdivision Regulations of Baldwin County, La., &sect;&sect; 1.2.2, 5.1, and 5.2.2 unenforceable on the ground that they were vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the owner was not entitled to a writ of mandamus compelling the commission to approve its preliminary plat. It was not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect;&sect; 1.2.2, 5.1, and 5.2.2. vested in the commission the type of arbitrary discretion to deny the owner's preliminary plat that was prohibited under Alabama law. The legislature specifically authorized planning commissions to prohibit inappropriate construction in the flood-prone areas, Ala. Code &sect; 11-19-4, through implementation of the land-use and control measures established under the broad authority conferred on county commissions, Ala. Code &sect; 11-19-3. Although some development in flood-prone areas could be permitted as appropriate, development in such areas had to be denied where it was deemed by the planning authority to be inappropriate. That was precisely the scenario contemplated by &sect;&sect; 1.2.2, 5.1, and 5.2.2. Those sections did not deprive the owner of notice as to what was required in order to lawfully subdivide its real property. The owner could reasonably have known that exceptional and unique conditions of topography would render bay lots unsuitable for subdivision due to flooding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder in the deaths of three victims. Currently, the supreme court granted his petition for certiorari review. The supreme court affirmed the finding that defendant was not mentally retarded.

The supreme court reversed the trial court's decision to continue with the penalty-phase hearing after becoming aware of comments made to veniremembers by one of the victim's relatives. Comments by that victim's mother not only identified her to members of the jury venire as the mother of one of the victims, but also let them know that in her opinion, defendant deserved to be sentenced to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a settlement of claims in 22 separate actions for damage allegedly caused by an underground gasoline spill, a dispute arose over a fee-splitting agreement among the attorneys involved. The Tuscaloosa Circuit Court (Alabama) granted summary judgment to attorney one as to a breach of contract claim. The appellate court reversed. On remand, the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of attorneys two and three. Attorney one appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First, because the appellate court did not definitely address in the first appeal the issue of whether a binding contract existed between the parties, the law of the case doctrine did not preclude the trial court's determination of that issue on remand. The trial court was entitled to consider the issue of whether a binding and enforceable contract existed between the parties. Second, the terms of the parties' agreement as to attorney one's obligations regarding the gasoline litigation were not so indefinite as to render the agreement void and unenforceable. Finally, on remand, the trial court determined that the parties' fee-splitting agreement was unenforceable as violative of Ala. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(e), which addressed the division of fees between lawyers who were not in the same firm. However, the trial court erred because the sole remedy for a violation of Rule 1.5(e) was disciplinary in nature. The Rules were designed to provide guidance to lawyers and to provide a structure for regulating their conduct; not to be a basis for civil liability. Therefore, the trial court lacked the authority to declare the parties' agreement unenforceable as violative of Rule 1.5(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment and remanded the matter for proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bingo operators appealed from an order of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) upholding the Jefferson County Bingo Act, 1980 Ala. Acts 609, as amended by 1994 Ala. Acts 393 and 1999 Ala. Acts 415, against the operators' constitutional challenge and declaring valid certain regulations promulgated by the Jefferson County Sheriff pursuant to the Bingo Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court declared 1994 Ala. Acts 393 to be unconstitutional, and the constitutionality of that Act was not argued on appeal. Under the new bingo rules, the operators would have been able to operate bingo games only two days per week and five hours per day. 1980 Ala. Acts 609, &sect; 2 attempted to extend regulatory authority over bingo to the sheriff in Jefferson County, which was in direct conflict with Ala. Const. amend. 386, which clearly vested only the governing body of Jefferson County or the governing body of a municipality located in Jefferson County with the exclusive authority to regulate the operation of bingo games in Jefferson County. Accordingly, to the extent the Bingo Act granted regulatory authority to the sheriff of Jefferson County to issue permits and to promulgate rules and regulations regarding the operation of bingo games in Jefferson County, it was in conflict with amend. 386 and was unconstitutional. Consequently, any rules or regulations issued by the sheriff of Jefferson County pursuant to the Bingo Act were necessarily invalid.</SPAN></P>

The patient appealed from a judgment as a matter of law in favor of the administratrix on the patient's claim of wantonness against the decedent arising out of the same surgery. In addition, the administratrix contended that the trial court erred in declining to submit her proposed verdict form to the jury. The supreme court affirmed, stating that an expert's theory of causation was deducible as a reasonable inference from the known facts and conditions of the patient's situation. The trial court did not err in finding that the patient presented substantial evidence that the doctor's action caused injuries to her. However, the trial court did not err in entering a judgment as a matter of law in favor of the administratrix on the patient's wantonness claim because the supreme court was unable to conclude from the record that the doctor had engaged in conduct that was carried on with a reckless or conscious disregard for the rights or safety of the patient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation challenged a judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which dismissed for lack of jurisdiction its amended complaint against defendants, officials and others, seeking a declaration of its rights, a declaration that 2009 Ala. Acts 466 was unconstitutional, and an order permanently restraining defendants from carrying out the construction proposed by the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered a summary judgment for the corporation and against defendants in consolidated actions. It enjoined defendants from engaging in certain acts and retained jurisdiction to enforce its ruling. Defendants appealed. The supreme court affirmed the judgment in part, reversed it in part, and dismissed several defendants from the action. The legislature enacted the Act. The corporation filed its amended complaint. Defendant moved to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction. The supreme court held that the trial court had no authority to consider new claims, and it correctly dismissed the amended complaint. Because the corporation did not seek enforcement of the judgment enjoining defendants, the trial court did not have retained or residual jurisdiction to consider the amended complaint. Therefore, any claims regarding the validity or effect the Act should have been asserted in a new action challenging that legislation. The permanent injunction disposed of all issues between the parties and left nothing for the trial court to adjudicate. Although it retained residual jurisdiction to enforce its judgment, that judgment was final.</SPAN></P>

The home builders sought review of a judgment of the St. Clair Circuit Court (Alabama), which upheld the validity of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted the ordinance to help finance the completion of  water and sewer system projects. The supreme court held that the city properly exercised its authority in imposing service fees for the home builders' connections to its water and sewer systems. The impact fees and the capital-recovery fees imposed by the ordinance were properly characterized as service fees rather than taxes. The ordinance limited the use of the impact fees and the capital-recovery fees collected to capital improvements to its water and sewer systems. The fees were not considered general revenue to be used for any purpose. The city planned on using the fees imposed by the ordinance to defray the costs of providing water and sewer services to its residents. Under Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 11-45-1, 11-47-130, 11-50-1, 11-50-50, 11-50-52, 11-50-53, 11-50-54, 11-50-5, and 11-50-12, Alabama municipalities were granted the authority to establish and maintain water and sewer systems for their residents, and they could charge their residents for such services.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The County appealed from orders entered by the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) in an ongoing class action lawsuit involving the collection of business-license and occupational taxes. The circuit court determined that 2009 Ala. Acts 811, authorizing the County to collect the taxes in question, violated Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 95, and it ordered the County to pay postjudgment interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class action complaint alleged that the County's occupational tax was unlawful because 1967 Ala. Acts 406, which authorized the tax, had been repealed by 1999 Ala. Acts. 669. The trial court relied on unambiguous language in the latter act to hold that the collection of occupational tax was illegal. It entered an injunction that required that the tax payments received by the County be placed in escrow. The appellate court upheld judgment. While the appeal was pending, 2009 Ala. Acts 811 was enacted authorizing the County to resume the tax collection. The trial court denied the County's motion to dissolve the injunction and required the County to transfer the escrowed funds to a special master. In the instant appeal, neither the doctrine of judicial estoppel nor the doctrine of waiver applied. The appellate court struck the portion of 2009 Ala. Acts 811, &sect; 7 ratifying, validating, and confirming the illegal collection of taxes as inconsistent with the restraint on legislative authority set forth in Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 95, but left the remainder of the Act intact and in force. Postjudgment interest should not have been ordered because the judgment was not final.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed those portions of the orders that declared the retroactivity of tax collection to be unconstitutional and that required the County to pay postjudgment interest. It affirmed that portion of the judgment ordering the transfer of escrowed funds to a special master. It remanded the matter for the computation of the County's liability exclusive of taxes collected after January 12, 2009, but levied prior thereto.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 12-17-20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney sought to run for election for the judgeship in the third circuit of the 19th Judicial Circuit which was designated for Chilton County. The secretary of state took the position that the attorney's name could not be included on the ballot because he was a resident of Elmore County, not Chilton County. The supreme court found that the residency requirement imposed by Ala. Code &sect; 12-17-20(b)(16) gave the voters of each county in the 19th Judicial Circuit the opportunity for a greater level of familiarity with the candidates for at least one of the judgeships in the circuit. Conversely, it ensured that among the three judges of the 19th Judicial Circuit, at least one judge would be familiar with each county within the circuit. It promoted the appearance of justice by preventing a more populous county from dominating the judicial seats in the circuit. It avoided the possibility of excessive recusals: by requiring that the three circuit judges be residents from the three counties that composed the circuit, and it reduced the chances that more than one of the judges in the circuit might have to recuse himself from a case because of familiarity with the parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant church organization appealed the order of the Etowah Circuit Court (Ala.) that denied its motion to intervene in a declaratory judgment action brought by appellee sheriff regarding the licensing or organizations to conduct bingo games in Etowah County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff filed a declaratory judgment action in which he asked the circuit court to decide the applicable law under which the sheriff's investigation of applicants for bingo permits had to be conducted. The county commission, had issued a resolution promulgating rules and regulations for the operation of charitable machine bingo. The sheriff's responsibility under the rules was to conduct an investigation to determine the appropriateness of the issuance of licenses to applicants for bingo permits. The organization sought to intervene on behalf of its members, baptist churches, who were in close proximity to the proposed &quot;electronic bingo&quot; facilities. The organization argued that because the sheriff had taken no legal position and defendants were in agreement as to the issues, there were no adverse interests in the case. The supreme court found that the fact that the sheriff did not oppose defendants' motions for a summary judgment strongly indicated that he acquiesced in the requested judgment or, at least, that he had no preference in the standard to be used. As such, the circuit court never acquired jurisdiction because there was no justiciable controversy before it.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter the board also filed a notice of appeal from the trial court's order under Tenn. R. App. P. 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the underlying action, state employees filed an action involving a deferred compensation plan. The board filed a motion to intervene, but such motion was withdrawn before it was ruled on. Upon review, the court found that the board was not a party to the underlying because the record did not show that the trial court ever entered an order authorizing intervention and no party to the appeal contended that such an order existed. Furthermore, the trial court's order was an injunction and a petition for a writ of mandamus was not the proper method for seeking to review of the order. With regard to the appeal from the order, the court determined that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the board to prohibit it from issuing administrative subpoenas. The trial court had authority to control the discovery process in the underlying litigation but the board was never made a party to the underlying litigation and thus, the trial court had no authority to restrict the board's actions through the discovery process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff City brought an action against defendant business, an adult-only enterprise, alleging a violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-200.5(4), a part of the Alabama Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-200.1 et seq., and a violation of a parallel municipal code provision. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) found in favor of the City, upholding Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-200.2 against a constitutional challenge. The business appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court agreed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit that post-Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, public morality could still serve as a legitimate rational basis for regulating commercial activity, which was not a private activity. Accordingly, it held that &sect; 13A-12-200.2 did not violate the Due Process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.  In rejecting the business's state constitutional challenge under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 35, the court held that the legislature's restraint on the sale of sexual devices did not constitute an unreasonable restraint upon the inalienable right to pursue happiness or the right to contract in a field that involved expressive activity; the restriction in the statute was justified as an exercise of the state's police power. Next, the business did not properly raise a void for vagueness argument with regard to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-200.2 before the trial court and, therefore, that issue was not preserved. Finally, the enactment of &sect; 13A-12-200.2 did not violate Ala. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 42-43 because the source of the idea that was the impetus for the proposed legislation did not implicate separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted an application for rehearing, withdrew its initial opinion, and substituted another opinion. On application for rehearing, it affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff vehicle owner sued defendant towing company alleging negligence and wantonness; depravation of possession of her vehicle under Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-260; recovery of chattel in specie; conversion; negligent and wanton supervision; and fraudulent suppression. The Tuscaloosa Circuit Court (Ala.) dismissed the claims on the grounds they were preempted by federal law. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's son took the vehicle without the owner's knowledge and left it in the parking lot of a restaurant in Tuscaloosa, where it remained for several days. The city police department determined that the vehicle was abandoned vehicle and directed the company to tow it from the parking lot.  The company sold the vehicle at public auction. The circuit court determined that the claims against the company were preempted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994. The supreme court found that intrastate motor-carrier activities substantially affected interstate commerce, and Congress acted within its powers under the Commerce Clause in enacting 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 14501(c), and had under the Supremacy Clause, preempted the field of law regarding the price, route, and service of motor carriers of property. It was undisputed that the company was a motor carrier of property subject to &sect; 14501. The owner's claims were not exempted from preemption under &sect; 14501(c)(2)(C) because her claims related only to the company's service of towing and selling the vehicle, not to the price the company charged for those services.</SPAN></P>

The Macon Circuit Court (Alabama) entered a temporary restraining order pending a hearing. The special prosecutor filed an emergency motion to stay or vacate the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation asserted that its activities were lawful and that suffered irreparable injury by the seizure of the machines. The trial court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the action because the corporation sought to enjoin the enforcement of state criminal laws. The corporation had the opportunity to make its case in the prosecution of the criminal action, if any. Further, the civil forfeiture procedures were adequate to protect the corporation's due-process rights. The complaint did not present a situation in which the corporation acknowledged that its conduct was prohibited by a statute and then challenged the enforceability of the statute. To the contrary, the corporation strenuously maintained its innocence. Entertainment of a civil action for injunctive and declaratory relief under such circumstance could not be countenanced lest the trial court become involved in a role that should have been left to the factfinder in a criminal proceeding following a plea of not guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State petitioned for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals (Alabama), which reversed defendant's conviction for falsely reporting an incident in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-11-11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was staying at his ex-wife's residence. The ex-wife called the county sheriff to request that he be removed from the residence. When law-enforcement officers arrived defendant walked into an outbuilding and returned with an object that they believed was an explosive device. Defendant told the officers that the object was a bomb. The officers ordered him to stop and started shooting at him when he did not do so. Defendant stopped and told the officers that the bomb was not real. A bomb technician and an explosive technician verified that the bomb was a pipe. The court of appeals held that the court of criminal appeals erred by applying the plain language of the Commentary to &sect; 13A-11-11, rather than the plain language of that statute, in reversing the trial court's judgment as to defendant's conviction for falsely reporting an incident. The plain language of &sect; 13A-11-11 was unambiguous. It provided no exception for persons who falsely reported an incident to public officials who were engaged in police or fire-control activities. Although the Commentary purported to create such an exception, the language of the Commentary did not override the plain language of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the court of criminal appeals to address the arguments it did not address when it held that, based on the plain language of the Commentary, the statute was not intended to apply to facts such as those in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a state education board and its members and a postsecondary education department and its chancellor, appealed from an order of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff legislators declaring two of the board's policies invalid under the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act (AAPA), Ala. Code &sect; 41-22-1 et seq., and issued an injunction preventing the implementation of the policies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The polices at issue regarded the two-year-college system. One policy did away with a previous practice of permitting employees to work certain flexible schedules and the other policy prohibited the employment of elected state officials. The complaining legislators were employed in, or desired to become employed in, the two-year-college system. It was undisputed that the board adopted the policies without complying with the notice requirements set forth in Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 41-22-5, 41-22-23. The notice requirements of the AAPA did not apply because the policies were not rules as defined by Ala. Code &sect; 41-22-3(9)(a), (c). The policies were more like administrative activity that had a judicial character because they arose out of a specific controversy and addressed personal rights within the context of a personnel action. Accordingly, the policies were internal-management policies and as such were exempt from the AAPA notice requirements. The legislators also challenged the policies as violative of the Fair Dismissal Act, Ala. Code &sect; 36-26-100 et seq., and Ala. Code &sect; 17-1-4, but the trial court relied exclusively on the AAPA in granting summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Lowndes Circuit Court (Ala.) granted the company's request for a preliminary injunction. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company obtained a license to operate a bingo-gaming facility that contained several hundred electronic gaming machines that were played by hundreds of customers every day. The company purportedly obtained its license so that it could operate charity bingo games in accordance with Ala. Const. amend. 674, &sect; 3. Pursuant to its mandate, the task force executed a search warrant on the facility and confiscated approximately 105 electronic gaming machines, the servers to which those machines were attached, over $ 500,000 in proceeds, and various records kept by the company. The court found that the matter was not moot because the legal questions presented here, although presented in the context of an appeal from an order issuing a preliminary injunction, were legal questions of great public interest and importance that were likely to recur and indeed already had recurred in other locales. Plaintiffs failed to introduce substantial evidence from which the trial court reasonably could have concluded that plaintiffs had a &quot;reasonable likelihood of success&quot; in proving that the electronic gaming machines seized from the facility constituted the game of bingo.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order issuing a preliminary injunction was reversed, and the cause was remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a former inmate involuntarily committed to State custody, sued appellees, state officials, and alleged that the former inmate had been improperly classified as an &quot;adult criminal sex offender&quot; for purposes of Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-20 et seq. The Montgomery Circuit Court, Alabama denied the former inmate and his siblings motions for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. The former inmate and his siblings appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state officials argued that unless the former inmate's siblings could show that the Alabama legislature intended to direct the Alabama Community Notification Act (CNA), Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-20 et seq., directly at them, they had no standing under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Assuming, without deciding, that each of the former inmate's siblings had a constitutionally protected right to reside with the former inmate, the appellate court nonetheless concluded that the former inmate's siblings lacked standing to maintain a claim in the action under &sect; 1983 since only the person toward whom the state action was directed, and not those incidentally affected, could maintain a &sect; 1983 claim for a violation of the familial association right. Moreover, the former inmate's siblings failed to show that the state action in requiring the former inmate to continue complying with the residency restrictions of the CNA applicable to adult criminal sex offenders was directed at their right to familial association, and thus, any resulting deprivation of that right was merely incidental to the state action. Therefore, the former inmate's siblings lacked standing to maintain a claim in the action under &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal was dismissed insofar as it concerns the former inmate's siblings. The trial court's judgment was affirmed insofar as it denied the former inmate's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

Act. 382 (Act) and a city ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring the Act and the ordinance void.

Each of the 21 sections of the Act related to the subject, and it was unreasonable to require that the title detail each section. Plaintiffs cited no legal authority that demonstrates that the Act and ordinance impermissibly conflicted with the Municipal Public Improvement Act and the Alabama Improvement District Act. Plaintiffs cited no authority in support of the argument that the Municipal Improvement District Act and the Alabama Improvement District Act were controlling over the Act.

Acts 398 (Act) (codified at Ala. Code &sect; 33-6A-3.1) did not violate the equal-protection guarantees and Due Process Clauses of the U.S. Constitution and that it was not unconstitutionally vague. The Act prohibited certain marine vessels on three impoundment lakes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The impoundment lakes were owned in whole or in part by a utility company. Appellants argued that the classifications in the Act were arbitrary because they did not further a legitimate governmental purpose and could not be rationally related to any reasonably conceivable governmental purpose. They also argued that the Act was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court noted that limiting certain boats from certain lakes can positively affect the use, enjoyment, and overall atmosphere, of those lakes and that it was reasonable for a state to seek to reserve particular waterways for particular purposes and to foster particular atmospheres. Appellants argued unsuccessfully that the trial court had an obligation to examine the legislature's actual motive in passing a statute. There was an overabundance of evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that the Act furthered one or more conceivable legitimate governmental purposes and that the classifications in the Act were rationally related to those purposes. The Act contained sufficient notice to the public regarding the type of marine vessels that were prohibited on the three impoundment lakes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two suits concerned a vehicular collision, which occurred while the jailer was transporting a prisoner to a certain facility; the prisoner was killed and the driver of the other vehicle suffered injuries. Both suits alleged negligence and wantonness against the jailer in his individual capacity. The trial court denied the jailer's motions to dismiss on the basis that absolute immunity under art. I, &sect; 14 extended only to sheriffs and deputy sheriffs, but did not include jailers. The jailer contended that because he was acting in the line and scope of his employment when the accident occurred, he was entitled to state immunity under art. I, &sect; 14. In rejecting this argument and denying the writ, the court reviewed pertinent case law and found that no cases had extended the state immunity afforded a sheriff to any sheriff's employees other than deputy sheriffs, who were considered the sheriff's alter egos, and thus, entitled to immunity because they acted as a sheriff. In contrast, a jailer working for a sheriff's office could not be properly viewed as an extension or alter ego of the sheriff, and the court declined to extend art. I, &sect; 14 state immunity to the jailer.</SPAN></P>

The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) granted summary judgment in favor of the employer on all of these claims. The employee sought review only as to the ruling on his breach of contract claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When he applied for a job with the employer, the discussions concerned a change of control agreement, which was represented as a favorable condition. The employee did not know the terms of this agreement. Although he testified that he signed such an agreement, the employer was unable to find it. Prior to a pending merger, the employee participated in a committee to develop plans for his new department. As a result of the merger, the employee sustained a large reduction in responsibilities and staff. When he accepted a new job, the employer declined to pay him under the change of control agreement on the basis that it did not believe that the merger adversely impacted him. On appeal, the court held that there were numerous disputed factual issues, which made summary judgment on the breach of contract claim erroneous. In particular, there was a disputed issue as to whether a change of control agreement existed between the parties. If there was such an agreement, there were also genuine issues of material fact as to its terms, whether it was supported by consideration, and whether the employer breached it by refusing to pay the employee severance compensation and legal expenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment ruling in favor of the employer on the employee's fraud and suppression claims, reversed the summary judgment ruling on the employee's breach of contract claim, and remanded this claim for resolution of the disputed factual issues by the trier of fact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer filed a class action in Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) against defendants, county commission and county officials, alleging that the occupational tax levied by the county was being collected unlawfully. The trial court certified the class and also entered summary judgment in favor of the taxpayers. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Act No. 406, enacted in 1967, authorized the county to impose an occupational tax upon any person engaging in a business, exempting those who already paid a license tax to the state or the county. Act No. 99-669, which expressly repealed Act. No. 406, also sought to impose an occupational tax. The trial court determined that Act No. 99-669 was valid, in contrast to an earlier decision declaring it invalid. The county argued that the this determination was barred by res judicata based upon the earlier decision. The court held that the taxpayers in the earlier litigation contended that Act No. 99-669 violated the Equal Protection Clause; the present taxpayers, by contrast, asserted that Act No. 99-669 was validly enacted and that it repealed Act No. 406. Therefore, res judicata did not bar their claim. The court held that the prior judgment declaring Act No. 99-669 invalid was void for lack of jurisdiction because the issue of validity as presented there was a nonjusticiable political question under another Alabama case. Although that Alabama case was decided after the decision declaring Act No. 99-669 void, it operated retroactively because it dealt with a constitutional question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">defendant was indicted for vehicular homicide and for assault in the second degree. He applied for youthful offender status. The trial court adjudicated him a youthful offender on the basis of the underlying charges of vehicular homicide and second-degree assault. Defendant moved to dismiss the vehicular-homicide count of his indictment, arguing that the failure to allege a culpable mental state rendered that count fatally defective. The trial court denied the motion. The court of criminal appeals reversed. The supreme court ruled that the court of criminal appeals misconstrued its holding in a prior case, which was not based on any deficiency in an indictment. Defendant's indictment substantially followed the language of &sect; 32-5A-192(a) and was proper under Ala. R. Crim. P. 13.2(a). The vehicular-homicide indictment clearly apprised him with a reasonable certainty of the nature of the accusation against him so that he could prepare his defense and plead the judgment of conviction as a bar to any subsequent prosecution for the same offense. The absence of a mens rea averment in the indictment did not render the indictment fatally defective or void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State legislators sued the Alabama Governor and Comptroller (administration), seeking a judgment declaring that the Governor's line-item veto of an appropriations bill violated Ala. Const. art. V, &sect; 126. The administration contended that &sect; 4 of the bill violated Ala. Const. art. XI, &sect; 213 and Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 71. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) entered a summary judgment in favor of the legislators; the administration appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the Governor's veto of the bill was unconstitutional because, in his veto message, he had not set &quot;out in full&quot; the item or items he wished to veto. The appellate court agreed. It was insufficient that the Governor identified by line and page number all of &sect; 4 of the bill; he was required by art. V, &sect; 126 to set out in full the item or items he wished to veto. Section 4 of the bill did not offend art. XI, &sect; 213, which required a pro rata reduction of all appropriations in the event of a budget shortfall. As &sect; 4 merely imposed a condition on certain appropriations--that the State have the funds to satisfy them--it did not violate Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 71, which required the legislature to address only appropriations in a general-appropriations bill. Although Ala. Code &sect; 41-4-90 required an estimate of available funds by the Alabama Department of Finance and &sect; 4 required a similar estimate by the Governor, there was no conflict because &sect; 41-4-90 operated when proration was declared and appropriations were reduced, and &sect; 4 addressed how the conditional appropriations made in the bill were funded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being added as a defendant in an existing lawsuit, the city filed a cross-claim against the town to challenge the town's purported annexation of three parcels of property located in the county.

Acts 481 regarding in part defective annexations went into effect, the town moved for relief from the summary judgment ruling and claimed that it validated the town's annexations. The trial court agreed with the town and entered a judgment dismissing the city's claims in their entirety. The state supreme court found that the trial court erred in finding that Ala. Code &sect; 11-41-8(b), regarding defective annexations and which was contained in 2008 Ala. Acts 481 that went into effect during the litigation, could be applied to bar the city's claims. It so concluded because it found that Ala. Code &sect; 11-41-8(b) did not apply since the annexations in the case were not at issue due to the fact that the validity of the town's incorporation to annex those properties, pursuant to Ala.

Code &sect; 13A-8-30 (the Act) and Montgomery, Ala., Ordinance No. 3-2008, and for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 13A-8-30 regulated secondary metals recycling. The ordinance addressed the detrimental impact that copper thefts and illegal trade in stolen copper had on citizens. The court disagreed that the Act and the ordinance conflicted. The fact that the Act did not regulate copper purchases of $ 100 or less did not create a conflict with the ordinance, which did regulate such purchases. The ordinance enlarged on the provisions of the Act by adding restrictions. The check issuance portion of the ordinance did not prohibit anything the Act expressly permitted or permit anything the Act expressly prohibited. Even assuming that the ordinance applied to new and salvaged copper, the ordinance did not conflict with the Act--the phrase &quot;metals that have served their original economic purpose&quot; was part of the definition of secondary metals recycler and references to whom the provisions of the Act applied and not the definition of nonferrous metals.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for felony DUI after he was convicted of three or more DUI charges, in violation of &sect; 32-5A-191(h). Prior to trial, defendant's counsel asserted various arguments against use of the prior DUI convictions. The trial court held that the prior DUI municipal court convictions could not be used to enhance the felony DUI charge. The State appealed that order. The appellate court dismissed the State's appeal on the ground that it did not have the right to appeal from the trial court's order because the trial court had not dismissed the charge. The State filed a petition for certiorari review, which was granted. The court found the trial court order had the effect of dismissing that portion of the indictment charging defendant with a felony offense. The appellate court's ruling resulted in a denial to the State of appellate review of the merits of the trial court's dismissal order. Accordingly, the appellate court erred in finding that the trial court did not &quot;dismiss&quot; the charge, such that appellate review thereof was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the appellate court and remanded the matter to the appellate court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 34-21-80 to -93. When the motion was denied, the State appealed to the Court of Appeals, which granted the State's petition for a writ of mandamus directing the trial court to vacate its prior order. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that the State lacked authority under Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 12-12-70(c), 12-22-91, and Ala. R. Crim. P. 15.7 to appeal from an adverse ruling in a criminal case. Accordingly, it was not entitled to seek mandamus review of the pretrial denial of its motion in limine. If the trial court allowed the jury to consider the evidence the State sought to keep out, it would be acting within its lawful authority, and the State will have no right of appellate review. Such an outcome would reflect the ordinary and proper administration of criminal justice, not a disruption thereof. Accordingly, defendant was entitled to mandamus relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor vetoed a general-fund appropriations bill. The legislature had no opportunity to address his action because the Alabama House of Representatives received the veto while a motion for adjournment was being made. The legislators filed suit against the Governor and comptroller. The Governor and comptroller moved to dismiss the complaint. The supreme court held that the trial court correctly denied the motion to dismiss because the Governor and comptroller had no clear legal right to such relief. The legislators provided evidence that the Governor's veto created an actionable dispute. They showed that the veto required State agencies to calculate their operating budgets based on inaccurate funding information, which required agencies to allocate for their operations money that would not be available. State agencies were allocating and spending operating expenses according to that inaccurate information. The Governor's veto immediately raised a dispute as to whether State agencies that were not protected under the bill were operating on budgets, which, if the veto was held invalid, would exhaust their available funds before the end of the fiscal year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alabama Department of Corrections (DOC) and its commissioner, appealed from a summary judgment entered by the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) in favor of the Montgomery County Commission on a complaint seeking a judgment declaring that, pursuant to under Ala. Code &sect; 14-3-30(b), the DOC was responsible for the payment of medical bills incurred to treat an inmate housed at a county detention center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the commissioner and the DOC claimed that the action, which was initially filed against the DOC only, was barred by sovereign immunity. The court agreed. The Commission's original complaint named only the DOC as a defendant. Because the DOC was a State agency, it was, under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14, absolutely immune from suit. Because the original complaint named only a party that had absolute State immunity, it failed to trigger the subject-matter jurisdiction of the circuit court. Consequently, it was a nullity. The purported amendment of the nullity (to add the Commissioner as a party) was also a nullity. Because the circuit court never acquired subject-matter jurisdiction over the action, its orders and judgments were void, including the judgment that was the subject of the appeal. In conclusion, the circuit court did not have--and never had--subject-matter jurisdiction over the action; thus, its judgment was void. Moreover, the void judgment did not support an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal, vacated the summary judgment, and dismissed the action.</SPAN></P>

The candidate won the primary election; his opponent contested the election based on the candidate's noncompliance with the FCPA.

Code &sect; 17-5-18 in revoking the certificate of nomination of a candidate who had failed to comply with the  FCPA. As the trial court had jurisdiction to determine whether chairman violated a statutory or constitutional provision in revoking the certificate of nomination, Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State was awarded compensatory damages for the underpayment of oil and gas royalties the company owed it under offshore leases.

The citizen challenged the deposit of the interest into the general fund. The supreme court held that the citizen had no standing to sue the officials. The citizen's claim of standing as a taxpayer failed because the Trust Fund, which was established under Ala. Const. amend. 450, received no tax revenue. It was funded only from royalties from the production of oil and gas under offshore leases. Therefore, no taxpayer was liable to replenish any shortfall that could occur in the Trust Fund. Although the citizen was a member of the community to be benefited by the Trust Fund, he could not demonstrate a sufficient special interest in its enforcement to entitle him to institute a suit as to that trust.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Taxpayers and the governor filed suit against a county election commission, alleging that a special election to fill a district seat on the county commission was unconstitutional because 1977 Ala. Acts 784, which authorized a special election to fill a commission vacancy, violated Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 105. They challenged an order of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which ruled that the vacant seat was to be filled by special election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A member of the commission resigned his seat. The county election commission adopted a resolution calling for a special election to fill the seat. The governor appointed a candidate to fill the vacant seat pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 11-3-1(b). A special election was held. The trial court ruled that the governor's appointment was unauthorized and that the winner of the special election was entitled to the seat. The supreme court held that the taxpayers had standing to bring their claims. The county incurred costs in holding the special election for the commission seat that it otherwise would not have incurred in administering the presidential-preference primary election. The supreme court ruled that the trial court erred in upholding the validity of the special election. The governor's appointment was in accordance with &sect; 11-3-1(b) and was lawful. Act 784, by purporting to provide for special elections to fill commission vacancies, was in conflict with &sect; 11-3-1(b), which required vacancies to be filled by gubernatorial appointment with no exception for preexisting local laws. Therefore, the Act, as a preexisting local law, was repealed by the legislature's adoption of &sect; 11-3-1(f).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause. It instructed the trial court to enter an appropriate order declaring that the required election was to be placed on the general election ballot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) entered a judgment that denied petitioner sheriff's motion to dismiss respondent personal representative's actions against the sheriff in his official capacity alleging breach of contract and violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 regarding the death of the pretrial detainee while in the sheriff's custody. The sheriff filed a petition for writ of mandamus directing the trial court to dismiss those actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pretrial detainee was arrested and detained at the sheriff's county jail. Thereafter, she allegedly requested medical care. However, she was not admitted to a hospital until two weeks later and died the next day. The personal representative brought claims against the sheriff in his individual capacity for breach of contract regarding his official bond with a surety company and under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for violation of the Fourteenth Amendment for being deliberately indifferent to her medical needs. After his motion to dismiss was denied as to both claims, the state supreme court found that (1) the sheriff was entitled to have the breach of contract claim dismissed since he had immunity pursuant to Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 given that the breach of contract claim requested money damages against him for his acts within the scope of his employment as a sheriff for the State and (2) the sheriff was not entitled to have the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim dismissed, since the personal representative adequately alleged that the pretrial detainee had a Fourteenth Amendment right to not have the sheriff act with deliberate indifference to her medical needs and that he violated that right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court granted the sheriff's petition for writ of mandamus as to the personal representative's breach of contract claim and directed the trial court to dismiss that claim. However, the state supreme court denied the sheriff's petition for writ of mandamus as to the personal representative's federal statutory civil rights claim and, thus, found he was not entitled to dismissal of that claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Alabama Department of Finance (Department), sought a writ of mandamus instructing the Madison Circuit Court (Alabama) to grant its motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for a summary judgment, as to the issue of its liability to respondent equipment provider (provider) on sovereign immunity grounds or, failing that, to grant its motion to transfer the case to the Montgomery Circuit Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department contended that it was entitled to the sovereign immunity conferred on the State by Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14, and, as a result, the trial court should have granted its motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for a summary judgment. The instant court agreed. Because actions against the State or against State agencies were absolutely barred by art. I, &sect; 14, the Department was entitled to an order directing the trial court to dismiss it from this action. In addition, because the provider filed a motion to strike certain portions of the Department's mandamus petition, and the Department candidly agreed that the portions of its petition to which the provider objected were due to be stricken, the provider's motion was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The writ was issued and the circuit court was instructed to dismiss the Department from the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT), the governor, and the director of ALDOT challenged a decision of the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama) in favor of a contractor in its action for declaratory and mandamus relief directing the governor and the director to pay liquidated damages and a retainage reserved by ALDOT. Appellants claimed that the suit was barred by Ala. Const. art. 1, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ALDOT, as a State agency, was absolutely immune from suit. Only State officers named in their official capacity--and not State agencies--could be defendants in such proceedings. Therefore, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to entertain an action or to enter a judgment against ALDOT. The other appellants did not contest the trial court's holding that a liquidated damages provision in the contract was unlawfully applied nor did they properly present an argument as to how ALDOT was legally entitled to the funds withheld as retainage. The claims for unliquidated damages, although purporting to fall within exceptions to &sect; 14, were claims that sought damages for breach of contract, which were forbidden under &sect; 14. The assessment of damages against the State officers named in their official capacities divested the treasury of funds in a manner that was prohibited by &sect; 14. Therefore, under &sect; 14, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter a judgment or to direct the governor and the director to pay on the unliquidated damages counts. The issue of whether the claims procedure was fair and impartial was no longer moot and had to be addressed on remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared the judgment against ALDOT as void and dismissed the appeal as to ALDOT. The judgment directing the payment of unliquidated damages had to be dismissed. The court affirmed the holding as to the liquidated damages and the direction to pay the retainage and remanded the issue as to whether the claims procedure was fair and impartial for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The voter sought the revocation of nomination certificates issued by officials to unopposed state senatorial candidates under Ala. Code &sect; 17-13-5(c) (formerly Ala. Code &sect; 17-16-11(c)) and the removal of the candidates' names from the general election ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter sought a declaratory judgment, an injunction, a writ of mandamus, and a writ of quo warranto, claiming that the candidates failed to file reports described in former Ala. Code &sect; 17-22A-8 (currently Ala. Code &sect; 17-5-8) of the Act. Although Ala. Code &sect; 17-22A-21 provided the basis for a substantive remedy, it did not provide the procedure for obtaining that remedy; instead, that procedure was stated in those sections of Title 17 governing the contest of a general election. By not filing a statutory election contest after the general election, the voter chose not to use the procedure provided by the legislature for a party seeking to obtain, under &sect; 17-22A-21, the revocation of a certificate of election issued after the general election. Once the general election occurred and the time to contest the general election under former Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 17-15-22 to -26 (currently Ala.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electric supplier, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 37-14-37(b), sued the town in the Baldwin Circuit Court (Alabama), alleging that the town was wrongly supplying electricity to premises under the Alabama Service Territories for Electric Suppliers Act, Ala. Code &sect; 37-14-30 et seq. After the trial court denied the town's motion for judgment as a matter of law, the jury returned a general verdict in favor of the town. The parties filed cross-appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electric supplier contended that the town was providing electricity to customers in a service area which the supplier claimed was assigned to the supplier under Ala. Code &sect; 37-14-32 of the Alabama Service Territories for Electric Suppliers Act. The supplier argued that the trial court erred by admitting at trial evidence regarding an oral agreement between the town and the supplier and by refusing to give certain jury instructions which the supplier requested. On appeal, the court found that, because the supplier did not, pursuant to Ala. R. Evid. 103, preserve for appellate review its objection to the testimony regarding the existence of an oral agreement and because the supplier did not, and, in fact, could not, demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the trial court's evidentiary ruling, the judgment of the trial court was to be affirmed on the issue of the admissibility of the evidence. Additionally, because the affirmative defenses regarding the supplier's claims were not properly before the trial court under Ala. R. Civ. P. 8(c), the trial court did not err by refusing to give the two instructions which the supplier requested on the supplier's untimely defenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision was affirmed in the appeal by the electric supplier. The town's cross-appeal was dismissed as rendered moot by the affirmance of the decision in the supplier's appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a wife acting as the executrix of her husband's estate, sued defendant chemical companies alleging their liability under the Alabama Extended Manufacturer's Liability Doctrine. The chemical companies moved to dismiss and/or for a judgment on the pleadings. The Tuscaloosa Circuit Court, Alabama, granted the motions and dismissed the claims against them with prejudice. The wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that the decedent's exposure to various chemicals while he was employed by the chemical companies caused him to develop acute myelogenous leukemia and resulted in his death approximately 10 years after he left his employment. The chemical companies' motion, which relied on the supreme court's opinion in Garrett v. Raytheon Co., 368 So. 2d 516 (Ala. 1979), argued that the complaint was time-barred, which raised the issue of whether the date of last exposure rule was still the law in Alabama. It was not because the supreme court reversed Garrett and its progeny. The supreme court held that the wife's cause of action accrued when a &quot;manifest, present injury&quot; occurred. This accrual rule of toxic-substance-exposure applied prospectively, except in the present case, in which it applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the cause was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the supreme court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

Both parties were candidates for a city mayoral election. The elected candidate's petition for a writ of mandamus seeking to dismiss the opponent's complaint was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues in the election contest concerned mainly the validity of several votes cast by absentee ballots. The elected candidate received 1,120 votes, the opponent 997 votes, and a third candidate, who was not a party to the action, 39 votes. The opponent contested the election on various grounds centering around illegally casted absentee ballot votes in the elected candidates favor. The court determined that the notice of contest complaint filed by the opponent sufficiently set forth what election was being challenged and contained an affidavit setting out the grounds of the contest, which was all that was required by Ala. Code &sect; 17-15-29. The court upheld the trial court's order requiring a new runoff election as, after the trial court recounted the votes after taking away certain votes cast in the elected candidate's favor for improper identification, changes or alterations, improper application addresses, non-residence, and other reasons, no candidate received a majority of the votes under Ala. Code &sect; 11-46-70. The court noted that the fact that so much time had passed since the election did not limit the trial court's authority to order the runoff election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court ordering a runoff election between the parties.</SPAN></P>

Following the primary election, the candidate and nominee participated in a runoff election. They received an equal number of votes in the runoff election. The nominee received the nomination through a process to break the tie and was certified as the Democratic party nominee for the upcoming general election. Eight days before the general election, the candidate and spouse filed suit alleging that during the time leading to the primary and runoff elections, the nominee had violated certain reporting provisions of the Fair Campaign Practices Act, now Ala. Code &sect; 17-5-1 et seq. They requested that the nominee's certificate of nomination be revoked and that his name be removed from the general election ballot. The trial court dismissed their action. The state supreme court found that since they did not file the required election contest under Ala. Code &sect; 11-46-69, the trial court pursuant to now Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sued defendant State, state officials, and State of Alabama General Liability Trust Fund, seeking a declaration that they were obligated to provide him a defense and indemnification in a federal action brought by an individual the employee had shot. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) found that the employee was entitled to a defense from the Fund, but was not entitled to indemnification from the Fund. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action against the State was barred by Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14, as no exception to the State's absolute immunity applied. The appeals against the Fund were dismissed as it was not a legal entity subject to suit. The action against the state officials was not barred by &sect; 14 where the case sought to compel state officials to perform their legal duties and was brought under the Declaratory Judgments Act, Ala. Code &sect; 6-6-220 et seq. An insurer/insured relationship did not exist between the employee and the Fund where the amended Fund guidelines expressly stated that they did not constitute a policy of insurance and made no reference to a premium. Thus, the Fund owed the employee only the duties and obligation imposed upon it by its terms and conditions. The Fund had not waived its right to rely on the criminal-acts exclusion in issuing a reservation-of-rights letter as it was premature to invoke the exclusion prior to the time the employee's conviction became final. Ala. Code &sect; 27-14-19(a) did not estop the Fund from relying on the exclusion as no insurance contract existed. The state officials did not owe the employee a duty to defend once he was convicted of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal was dismissed with respect to the Fund. The judgment was reversed and remanded as to the claim that the employee was entitled to a defense from the Fund, but was affirmed as to the finding that the employee was not entitled to indemnification from the Fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The representative proposed an amendment to the state constitution to provide for the legal operation of bingo games for eleemosynary purposes in one county. The bill was passed, and the voters approved the constitutional amendment in a referendum. This suit followed. The citizens argued the amendment violated the separation of powers doctrine under the Alabama Constitution, and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the state and U.S. Constitutions. The citizens argued the amendment denied them the opportunity to live in a county in which a valid law on bingo game operations existed. The high court held that such a violation of a purported right did not establish an actual, concrete and particularized injury of fact. One citizen's assertion that he was &quot;psychologically devastated&quot; because he was subjected to the amendment was insufficient to establish an injury in fact for standing purposes. Neither citizen had standing to bring the action challenging the constitutionality of the amendment.</SPAN></P>

The former employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former employee had been hired to work as a truck driver for the former employer. One day, while the former employee was driving his truck, it overturned. He sought workers' compensation benefits. Thereafter, his doctor then cleared him to return to work without restrictions. He did, but suffered from a fear of driving. He then informed the former employer's officials that he could not continue driving. The former employer allowed the former employee to make a choice: either return to driving a truck or have his employment terminated. The former employer stated he was unwilling to drive. The former employer then terminated his employment. The trial court denied the former employer's motion for judgment as a matter of law filed at the close of his evidence and the close of all of the evidence on his Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-11.1 retaliatory discharge claim. A jury then returned a verdict in his favor and awarded damages to him. The state supreme court found that the trial court erred in denying the former employer's motions for judgment as a matter of law since he did not show his employment was terminated solely for filing for workers' compensation benefits, as the statute required.</SPAN></P>

Defendant attorney general, in his official capacity acting for the state, appealed. Plaintiffs, a registered voter, an elected judicial candidate, and the forum county judicial commission moved to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature enacted 2006 Ala. Acts 355 (&quot;2006 Act&quot;) authorizing creation of an additional judgeship to be filled in a specific judicial circuit by the governor on or after a certain date. The 2006 Act also stated that the judgeship was subject to election at the next general election after that appointment date and the judge elected would then serve a full term. The registered voter filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a finding that the provision for filling the office by gubernatorial appointment violated Ala. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 152 and 153. The trial court agreed, declared the 2006 Act unconstitutional, and directed the elected judicial candidate to assume the position's duties. The state supreme court found its jurisdiction was not limited by Ala. Code &sect; 17-16-44 because matters beyond the conduct of an election were involved and that the issue was not moot. It then found that the governor did not have the constitutional authority to fill a &quot;vacancy&quot; through appointment of the initial officeholder, but that the &quot;appointment provision&quot; in the 2006 Act could be severed from the provision that a person be elected judge to fill the position after a certain date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner constructed two brick flower planters in her yard located along a state highway. Allegedly, she was told by her neighbor, a state transportation department employee at the time, that the planters were permissible under applicable regulations. The state transportation department later notified her that the planters encroached upon the state transportation department's right-of-way. She sought declaratory relief in the trial court, which included a request that the planters be allowed to remain on the property. The trial conducted a hearing and ruled for the property owner. It did not interpret the state regulation; instead, it found that the property owner reasonably relied on the representations of the state transportation department's employee. On appeal, the state supreme court found that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction because the state transportation department had immunity from suit as a state agency, pursuant to Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. It also found that no exception to immunity was shown, especially since her declaratory action sought relief other than construction of a law and how it should be applied in a given situation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners sued the city, alleging nuisance, trespass, negligence, strict liability, and inverse condemnation arising from the city's operation of a landfill. On remand, the Lauderdale Circuit Court (Alabama) entered summary judgment in favor of the city on all claims. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment on the strict liability claim was affirmed as the landowners' brief provided no legal authority to show that the operation of the landfill and the risk of harm it created constituted an ultra-hazardous activity. The city had a duty to monitor the amount of methane generated from the landfill and to perform remedial measures after the landfill closed given its monitoring plan submitted pursuant to Ala. Admin. Code r. 335-13-4-.16(2) (2005). The city also had a common law duty to maintain the landfill after its closure where it continued to own the property to store previously deposited waste materials and was aware of the ongoing emission of methane gas. The nuisance, negligence, and trespass claims accrued each time the city's maintenance and ongoing operation caused methane to migrate onto the landowners' properties. However, any claims that accrued six months before the landowners informed the city of their intent to sue were time-barred under Ala. Code &sect; 11-47-190. Summary judgment was proper as to the inverse condemnation claim where the city's placement and periodic monitoring of the pipes on the landowners' properties was performed for their benefit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment was affirmed as to the strict liability and inverse condemnation claims, but was reversed as to the nuisance, negligence, and trespass claims.

Plaintiff state interior design board, which had sued defendant interior designer for violating the Act, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state interior design board sued the interior designer in the trial court and alleged that she was in violation of the Alabama Interior Design Consumer Protection Act, 2001 Ala. Acts 660, Ala. Code &sect; 34-15B-1 et seq., for practicing &quot;interior design&quot; without registering with the state interior design board. In response, she alleged that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court held a bench trial and heard evidence that the services she provided to clients consisted of advice in selecting paint colors, accessories, fabrics, and furniture for homes and businesses. The trial court then found that the Act was overly broad, unreasonable, and vague in violation of the Alabama Constitution's due process provisions. On appeal, the state supreme court found the law was unreasonable because part of it allowed a nonregistered individual to make recommendations if they were made pursuant to a retail sale while nonregistered people like the interior designer could not make recommendations at all, even though the State had little legitimate interest in regulating matters such as the color of living room walls or the type of throw pillows to place on a sofa.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A property owner sued defendants, a trust, a church, a company, a city, and city council members, seeking a judgment declaring that the vacation of an alley was void because the city failed to comply with Ala. Code &sect; 23-4-2. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) dismissed the suit as time-barred under Ala. Code &sect; 23-4-5. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trust, church, and company owned property abutting the alley, and executed a declaration of vacation, which the city council approved. The owner alleged his property abutted the alley and that he had an easement to use it. Defendants argued that the owner's complaint was barred under &sect; 23-4-5 because he failed to file it within 30 days of the city's approval of the vacation. The high court held that the 30-day limitation did not apply to an abutting landowner who never received the notice of the hearing on the vacation required by Ala. Code &sect; 23-4-2, as the owner alleged. As the trust and church submitted a tax map purporting to show the owner's property did not abut the alley, the trial court erred in not granting the owner a continuance and in failing to dispose of the matter under Ala. R. Civ. P. 56. As it was possible the owner could prove he was an abutting landowner entitled to notice under Ala. Code &sect; 23-4-2, dismissal of the suit against the trust, church, city, and company was premature; factual analysis was required to determine whether the vacation procedures set forth in &sect; 23-4-2 were complied with. The owner conceded that the council members were immune from suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of the action as to the trust, church, company, and city was reversed. The dismissal of the action against the council members was affirmed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case involving claims of wrongful death and medical malpractice, defendant hospital challenged a judgment, entered on a jury verdict in the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama) in favor of plaintiff son, as administrator of the estate of his deceased mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties agreed that certain provisions of the Alabama Medical Liability Act of 1987, Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-540 et seq., applied. Pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-548(a), the son had the burden of proving by substantial evidence that the hospital's nurses failed to exercise such reasonable care, skill, and diligence as other similarly situated health care providers in the same general line of practice. The appeals court found sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that if a nurse had accurately communicated the mother's symptoms of pain to a reasonable cardiologist, it was more probable than not that the cardiologist would have included acute mesenteric ischemia in his differential diagnosis. The son presented sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that the nurse's negligent communication prevented the mother from receiving the medical care that probably would have prevented her death. Upon a de novo review of the punitive-damages award, involving the application of the Gore guideposts and the Hammond and Green Oil factors, it was found that the trial court should have reduced the award and that the award should have amounted to no more than $ 3,000,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed on the condition that, within 14 days of the date of the opinion, the son file with the court an acceptance of a remittitur of the punitive-damages award in the amount of $ 2,500,000, which would result in a judgment for him in the amount of $ 3,000,000 in punitive damages. Otherwise, the judgment of the trial court was to be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied both motions. He filed a petition for a writ of mandamus directing the trial court to set bail in a reasonable amount, because he could not be retried for capital murder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's first trial, at which he had been charged with capital murder, a jury found him guilty of the lesser offense of reckless manslaughter. The trial court set aside the conviction on grounds a jury instruction was defective. The intermediate appellate court held that the failure of the trial court to give a reasonable-doubt instruction was a structural defect that nullified the proceedings that had resulted in the manslaughter conviction. Thus, defendant could be prosecuted for capital murder. The high court held that structural errors were not necessarily the functional equivalent of jurisdictional defects that rendered the proceedings absolutely null. The jury's conviction of the lesser offense--under the general double-jeopardy rule--was an express acquittal of the greater offenses, because the jury was instructed that it could consider whether defendant was guilty of manslaughter only if it first concluded that the State had not proved all the elements of capital murder or of the lesser offense of murder. The high court rejected the State's argument that a jury's verdict of not guilty was valid only if the jury was properly instructed as to reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Just before his scheduled graduation from the medical college, but while on nonacademic probation, the student was arrested for the unlawful possession of prescription drugs and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of possession of drug paraphernalia. Thereafter, the student was dismissed from the college. The student did not appeal the decision, but filed an action seeking an order requiring the defendants to award him a degree of doctor of medicine. The state supreme court found that the college was a state institution. The process of recommending students for graduation required the exercise of discretion in evaluating a candidate's compliance with the prescribed guidelines, and was not merely a ministerial act. The student made no showing that the defendants' refusal to award him a medical degree was arbitrary, in bad faith, or that they exceeded their discretion. Therefore, they were entitled to state immunity. Because the student was afforded the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner, his due-process rights in Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 were not violated. The trial court correctly awarded summary judgment to the defendants.</SPAN></P>

The intermediate appellate court held that &sect; 40-10-160, providing for tax refunds based upon a &quot;mistake&quot; or an &quot;error,&quot; did not permit a refund when the taxpayer's overpayment resulted from its intentionally false statements as to the value of nonexistent assets. The high court agreed. An intentional misrepresentation was not included in the plain meaning of either &quot;error&quot; or &quot;mistake.&quot; Further, due to the clean hands doctrine, the trial court could not invoke its equity jurisdiction to grant the refund petitions, because there was no equity in allowing the taxpayer to obtain relief from its own fraudulent scheme.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county commission and various commissioners appealed a judgment from the Cleburne Circuit Court (Alabama), which was entered in favor of a supernumerary county sheriff (SCS) in his action, seeking a declaration that Ala. Code &sect; 11-2A-2(4) was unconstitutional, and ordering payment by the county parties of various salary adjustments and increases due him under Ala. Code &sect;&nbsp;36-22-62(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The SCS, who had previously served in a county sheriff capacity, indicated his election to participate in the supernumerary sheriffs' program, as provided by Ala. Code &sect; 36-22-60 et seq. After such appointment, the SCS received the proscribed salary pursuant to Ala. Code &sect;&nbsp;36-22-62(a). However, the commission denied the SCS salary adjustments based on Ala. Code &sect; 11-2A-2(4). Accordingly, the SCS filed his action. As the county parties failed to respond to the SCS's request for admission of facts, they were deemed admitted under Ala. R. Civ. P. 36. Thereafter, the trial court granted summary judgment to the SCS. On appeal, the court noted that as the SCS held an &quot;office of trust and profit,&quot; his remuneration could not be considered retirement pay, as such would have violated Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect;&nbsp;98. Accordingly, the SCS had no vested contractual interest in an alleged retirement plan. There was no impairment of the obligation of contracts under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 by the enactment of Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 11-2A-1 through 11-2A-8, and there was no right to a cost-of-living increase under Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 11-2A-2(4) and 11-2A-4(a), which were controlling over Ala. Code &sect; 36-22-62.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor entered into three contracts with ALDOT pursuant to which it was to undertake various roadway-construction projects. Based on contract provisions, ALDOT withheld liquidated damages from the contract price based on the contractor's alleged delays in completing the projects. This suit followed. The high court noted that the contractor named only ALDOT, not its director, as a party to its suit. Under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14, ALDOT, as a state agency, was absolutely immune from suit. Alabama case law did not support the contractor's claim that it had a right to sue a state agency for breach of contract. ALDOT's absolute immunity also barred the contractor's actions for relief by mandamus or injunction, its claims of negligence, unjust enrichment, and for recovery under a theory of quantum meruit. The declaratory-judgment exception to sovereign immunity did not apply, as the contractor was seeking damages, not the interpretation of a statute. As the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to ALDOT's immunity, it had no authority to allow the contractor to amend its complaint to substitute ALDOT's director as a party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The St. Clair Circuit Court (Alabama) granted partial summary judgment to a customer, in his action against a pawnbroker, which alleged that Ala. Code &sect;&nbsp;5-19A-7(a) was unconstitutional, and held that a portion of the Alabama Pawnshop Act which allowed an interest rate charge of 25 percent per month on car title pawns had to be struck down as a violation of equal protection. The pawnbroker appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court first considered the pawnbroker's claim that the customer lacked standing to contend that Ala. Code &sect; 5-19A-7(a) violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because he was a consumer, not a lender. In other words, it argued that the customer was not within a group of individuals that have been allegedly arbitrarily discriminated against, because the so-called &quot;favored class of pawnbrokers&quot; was not favored over the customer because he was not a lender. The customer claimed to have standing merely because he was encumbered by an arbitrarily excessive pawnshop charge that was more than the interest that could be lawfully charged to non-pawnshop borrowers. The instant court agreed with the pawnshop, finding that the customer lacked standing. Although the customer might have been tangentially affected by the Alabama Pawnshop Act, he was not directly affected in the manner necessary to confer upon him standing to raise the equal-protection issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city sued a property owner to collect business-license fees and gasoline taxes. The owner counterclaimed, alleging the city's annexation of its property was invalid because the act approving the annexation did not comply with Ala. Code &sect; 11-42-6(b). The Elmore Circuit Court (Alabama) held that the owner's property was validly annexed and that it owed business-license fees, gasoline taxes, sales taxes, and penalties. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the legislature passed an act expanding the city's limits by annexing several parcels, including the owner's land, the city filed the instant suit. The appellate court held that there was substantial evidence to establish that a map showing the territory to be annexed was furnished to the county probate office by the city clerk on or before the first date of the public-notice period and over one month before the bill that became the act was introduced in the legislature, as required by &sect; 11-42-6(a). There was substantial evidence, including testimony by the chief probate clerk and the city clerk, to establish that the map was &quot;open to the inspection of the public&quot; in the probate office during the public-notice period, which was all that &sect; 11-42-6(b) required. Therefore, the act was valid. But the trial court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the sales-tax issue because the city had not used the administrative procedures of the Alabama Taxpayers' Bill of Rights and Uniform Revenue Procedures Act, Ala. Code &sect; 40-2A-1 et seq., which the Alabama Local Tax Simplification Act of 1998, 1998 Ala. Acts 192, made applicable to the assessment of local sales taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed insofar as it ordered the owner to remit municipal sales taxes to the city, but was otherwise affirmed. The cause was remanded to the trial court for further action.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then raised an Atkins claim in the state supreme court, which it denied. However, his death sentence was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court for a new penalty-phase proceeding. In the trial court, defendant filed three Atkins motions. The trial court did not rule on them. Defendant was then sentenced to death again. The appellate court reversed and held as a matter of law that defendant was mentally retarded and therefore not eligible for the death penalty. On further review, the state supreme court found that the appellate court erred in applying only one of the three prongs set forth in Ex part Perkins to determine defendant's mental retardation when consideration of all three prongs might had yielded a finding that defendant was not mentally retarded and could be executed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit between a county and certain landlords seeking a judgment declaring that the county's practice of imposing liens against landlords for debts for sewer service incurred by and in the name of their tenants violated Ala. Code &sect; 35-9-14, the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) declared the statute unconstitutional, as inconsistent with Ala. Const. amend. 73. It then granted summary judgment to the county. The landlords appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlords contended that the collection powers conferred on the county by Ala. Const. amend. 73 expired with the payment of the last bond outstanding. This construction, however, contradicted the plain language of the amendment. The cessation of the authority to issue bonds and the cessation of the authority to collect sewer charges were not inexorably linked as the landlords contended. Instead, the amendment contemplated the continuation of the collection of service charges and rentals after the payment of the last of the bonded indebtedness. Moreover, the provision Ala. Code &sect; 35-9-14 depriving the county of the right to impose liens on landlords for charges for sewer services incurred in the name of a tenant clearly conflicted with the amendment. Specifically, the inclusion of the phrase in the statute &quot;notwithstanding any provision of law&quot; could not trump a constitutional provision. As a result, the amendment controlled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a bad faith action filed by an insured against its medical malpractice insurer, in which the insured alleged that the insurer was liable for that part of the judgment that exceeded the limits of the relevant policies, the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama) denied the insurer's summary judgment motion. The insurer was thus granted permission to appeal pursuant to Ala. R. App. P. 5, and this matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer moved for a summary judgment on the insured's negligent-failure-to-settle and bad-faith-failure-to-settle claims, arguing that its decision not to settle the underlying claim was made in reliance upon Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-547, which unambiguously capped its liability on that claim at a sum less than that at which settlement was offered. It argued that reliance upon a validly enacted statutory damages cap precluded a finding of negligence or bad faith. Upon a review of the evidence, the instant court affirmed the denial of summary judgment on the negligent-failure-to-settle claim, as the determination of whether the insurer's reliance on &sect; 6-5-547 was reasonable was a question that was better left to the trier of fact. Finally, because of the agreement between the parties, the court did not need to consider the insurer's argument as to the insured's remaining claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed inasmuch as it denied the insurer's motion as to the insured's negligent-failure-to-settle claim. Further, the court expressed no opinion as to that part of the order denying summary-judgment as to the bad-faith-failure-to-settle claim, because its decision on the negligent-failure-to-settle claim and the unique procedural posture of the case rendered a review of that claim unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The billboards were non-conforming to current zoning ordinances. However, the billboards pre-dated the ordinances, and initially, were &quot;grandfathered&quot; by the ordinances. After the billboards were damaged by a storm, the corporation repaired them, and the city sought removal. The corporation claimed that, because the billboards had not been destroyed or become 50 percent or more structurally deteriorated, they still were still &quot;grandfathered.&quot; The appellate court disagreed. Brewton, Ala., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 10.72 provided that the building inspector had discretion to decide if a sign was destroyed or 50 percent or more deteriorated and that, if either of those events occurred, any replacement sign was required to conform to the requirements of the ordinance. The trial court correctly relied on the building inspector's testimony that the four billboards were either destroyed or 50 percent or more structurally deteriorated, including the inspector's explanation of how he reached this decision, and reviewed photos taken after the damage to ensure that the inspector's decision was not arbitrary or unreasonable. This was fully consistent with the intent of the ordinances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While a citizen's motion to intervene in a suit challenging a town's election was pending, he filed a second suit against the town. The Cherokee Circuit Court (Alabama) denied his motion to intervene, dismissed the first action with prejudice, and dismissed the second action without prejudice pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-440. The citizen appealed; the two cases were consolidated for purposes of the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first suit, a citizens' group sued the town for scheduling an election on whether to allow alcoholic beverages to be sold. The trial court's order was reversed on appeal; after remand, the parties stipulated to dismiss the suit. The citizen later moved to intervene. Before his motion was ruled on, he filed the second suit, which the town moved to dismiss under &sect; 6-5-440. The high court held that after the parties filed the stipulation of dismissal under Ala. Ala. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(ii), the trial court lacked authority to entertain the first action; therefore, its subsequent orders in that action were void. As a void judgment could not support an appeal, the appeal in the first action had to be dismissed. Because the first suit was terminated long before the citizen sought to intervene in that action, the only action in which he was ever a party was the second action he filed against the town. Hence, Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-440, which barred a plaintiff from prosecuting two actions in Alabama courts at the same time for the same cause and against the same party, was inapplicable. Therefore, the trial court erred in dismissing the second action under &sect; 6-5-440.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court dismissed the citizen's appeal of the first suit, reversed the judgment dismissing the second suit, and remanded the second case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 6, were violated. After a trial de novo, the Baldwin Circuit Court (Alabama) upheld the deputy's termination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deputy was fired after being indicted for three felonies. As he was a merit employee, under Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 45-2-234.01(6) and 45-2-234.03, he could not be fired except for cause. The high court held that as the sheriff followed the county commission's manual concerning personnel policies and procedures in terminating the deputy, the sheriff was estopped to deny the manual's applicability. Though the deputy had not been convicted, the sheriff had &quot;cause&quot; to terminate him under the manual &quot;for the good of the county service&quot; since he would not have the trust of his peers or the public. The sheriff violated his due process rights by failing to give him written notice of the reasons for his termination and by failing to conduct a predisciplinary hearing. These procedural infirmities were cured by the trial de novo since the deputy had full notice of the reasons for the discipline and an opportunity to conduct discovery and to prepare for trial. Under Ala. Code &sect; 45-2-234.04, the county, not the State, funded the sheriff's operations; therefore, the sheriff was immune from the deputy's claims for back pay as a remedy for the due process violations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claims of the subject miners arose in Tuscaloosa County.

Viewing the actions of the Tuscaloosa miners independent of the other consolidated claims, the appellate court concluded that venue in the Bessemer Division was improper as to those actions because it was undisputed that the claims of the Tuscaloosa miners did not arise within the Bessemer Division. The appellate court concluded that &sect; 6-3-7 was not meant to override the Bessemer Act and its limitations on the judicial power of the Bessemer Division as to claims arising in that Division.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State, acting through a district attorney, brought a quo warranto action against a county commissioner, seeking removal of the county commissioner from office.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of his election and continuing for more than a year after he assumed office, the county commissioner was a convicted felon. Before the quo warranto action was filed, the county commissioner was pardoned by Georgia for his 1975 felony conviction for burglary. The appellate court held that the county commissioner's usurpation of office occurred when he assumed an office he was ineligible to hold. Having usurped his office initially, the county commissioner's usurpation continued for the entire one-and-one-half year term he served before he was removed from office, because during that entire term he deprived someone else who was lawfully entitled to the office at the time of the election from holding it. Quo warranto was the proper form of action. The facts as stated in the order directing the district attorney to bring the action showed the judge's awareness and belief that bringing such an action was necessary for the public good. The allegation in the present case that a public office was held by a person not entitled to that office clearly involved the public good. The county commissioner's ineligibility for office was not the result of any constitutional infirmity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Owners of a race course and others (&quot;the owners&quot;) filed an action for injunctive and declaratory relief against appellant district attorney (DA) in response to allegations that the owners were conducting an illegal gambling operation. The owners also argued that Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-20 was unconstitutionally vague. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) entered judgment in favor of the owners. The DA appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The system involved the use of &quot;readers.&quot; Once activated, a reader allowed a consumer to reveal sweepstakes entries. The trial court had found that the readers were not slot machines under Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13A-12-20(10) and 13A-12-27 because no element of chance was present at them and no consideration was paid to use them. The court held that the trial court erred. The element of chance was satisfied at the point of sale, before the readers were activated, by the same central database and other computer equipment that operated the readers. As for consideration, when consumers made a payment, they received four minutes of cybertime in addition to 100 sweepstakes entries. The trial court had erred in finding that the consideration was paid for the cybertime, not for the entries. It was clear that most consumers were paying to play the readers rather to use the cybertime. Furthermore, the fact that minimum quantities of free chances could be obtained did not mean that the game was not a gambling scheme. Next, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-20 was not unconstitutionally vague. The terms &quot;chance&quot; and &quot;consideration&quot; possessed generally accepted meanings, and the statute itself defined &quot;consideration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the owners and entered a judgment in favor of the DA. Because its decision resolved the issues in a related case, it dismissed the appeal in that case as moot.</SPAN></P>

The intermediate appellate court held that the trial court was barred from determining the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance as applied to the owners' day-care facility because they had failed to serve the Alabama Attorney General with a copy of their complaint pursuant to &sect; 6-6-227. The high court disagreed. The owners' suit challenged the constitutionality of the government officials' alleged selective enforcement of the zoning ordinance; it did not challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance itself. Therefore, notice to the Alabama Attorney General was not a prerequisite to the owners' prosecution of their claim under &sect; 6-6-227.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff's department employee sued the sheriff, in the sheriff's individual and official capacities, and asserted federal claims against the sheriff in federal court. The federal claims included a claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000e (Title VII). A settlement was reached. After the case was dismissed, the sheriff's department employee allegedly learned that the sheriff breached the settlement agreement. The sheriff's department employee filed another federal court action against the sheriff, which was dismissed. The sheriff's department employee then sued the sheriff, in the sheriff's individual and official capacities. The trial court granted the sheriff's motion to dismiss upon finding that the lawsuit did not fall under any exception to the sheriff's sovereign immunity. On appeal, the state supreme court found an action to enforce a settlement agreement reached between private parties in a Title VII case was not a Title VII action, but also found that the settlement agreement required the sheriff to carry out certain ministerial acts, which was an exception to his Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Alabama sued defendants, the Alabama Executive Commission on Community Services Grants and state officials, challenging the constitutionality of 2006 Ala. Acts 511, codified at Ala. Code &sect;&sect;&nbsp;29-2-121, 29-2-123, and 41-24A-1. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) found the Act constitutional. The State appealed; it filed a separate appeal for an injunction prohibiting defendants from disbursing funds pending disposition of its appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act created the Commission and authorized it to distribute legislative appropriations to a community-services-grant program. The Commission was composed of members of the executive department, but not the Governor, who could not appoint its members, directly oversee its actions, or veto its decisions. The State argued that the Act violated Ala. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 42 and 43, the separation-of-powers provisions, by denying the Governor his role as chief executive officer under Ala. Const. art. V, &sect; 113. The high court disagreed. Though the State argued the Governor, as the supreme member of the Executive Branch, had to have a meaningful role on the Commission, it did not articulate how much control he had to have or the nature of that control. In fact, the Governor did have a measure of control over the Commission, as it was composed of executive department officers, and Ala. Const. art. V, &sect; 121 authorized him to monitor executive department agencies; moreover, Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-4 authorized him to recover wrongfully spent public funds. The State also failed to prove that the Act called for an unconstitutional post-enactment legislative involvement in the grant procedure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to the State's first appeal, the high court affirmed the trial court's judgment. It dismissed the second appeal as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner, director, and board argued they were entitled to state and state-agent immunity in the underlying suit. The primary issue was whether the individual defendants, who were sued in their official capacities, were immune in the underlying action. The lower appellate court granted mandamus directing the trial court to dismiss the agencies but denied the petition as to the individual defendants. The court ruled that, because a holding in favor of the employee would ultimately have resulted in reinstatement to her former position, the relief she sought in the trial court fell within the well-recognized exceptions to immunity granted by Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. The lower appellate court was correct in ruling that Ala. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A husband petitioned the state supreme court for a writ of mandamus directing the Baldwin Circuit Court (Alabama) to grant his motion to stay divorce proceedings pending a resolution of criminal charges filed against him by his wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife alleged that her husband had been physically and verbally abusive to her. The husband was arrested after crashing his truck into the garage attached to the marital home. Defendant was charged with stalking, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-90, and other crimes. The husband argued that a civil trial on the divorce action would violate his privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution in his criminal trial. The state supreme court held that the stalking charge was parallel to the divorce proceeding, as the prosecutor would have to prove repeated actions of harassment on the part of the husband. The state supreme court also held that the husband's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was threatened by the civil action. Because of the overlap in the proceedings, the husband would likely be asked questions in the divorce proceeding that would cause him to incriminate himself in relation to the stalking charge. The state supreme court further held that the husband's Fifth Amendment rights outweighed the wife's wish for a speedy divorce, as the wife failed to show that her case would be prejudiced if a stay was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was granted and the trial court was ordered to stay the civil divorce proceedings until the stalking charge against the husband was adjudicated at the trial level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Calhoun Circuit Court (Alabama) entered a judgment on a jury's verdict awarding punitive damages to appellee estate administrator after the estate administrator filed a wrongful death claim against appellants, a doctor and professional association, due to the doctor's failure to go to the hospital to attend to a patient despite three telephone calls informing him the patient was in distress. The doctor and professional association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor removed a cancerous part of decedent's lung. Thereafter, while decedent was a patient at the hospital and still under the doctor's care, a nurse telephoned the doctor at his home and informed the doctor that decedent was in distress. The nurse said decedent had &quot;coded.&quot; However, the doctor did no go to the hospital. About two hours later, the nurse telephoned the doctor to inform him that decedent's vital signs were at dangerous levels. The doctor still did not go to the hospital. Almost two hours thereafter, the doctor was called again to be informed that decedent's life was in danger. The doctor later claimed he went to the hospital but the evidence did not support that claim. Decedent then died. Following a trial at which the doctor, the professional association, and the hospital were defendants, the jury awarded punitive damages. The hospital statutorily could be liable only to a certain limit. Judgment was entered against the doctor and professional association for the balance. On appeal, the state supreme court found that pursuant to Ala. Code 6-11-21(j), those damages did not have to be apportioned among the three defendants based on their relative culpability.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs brought suit challenging the validity of the ordinance that levied a county-wide tax for capital improvements to public schools in the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendants upheld the validity of the ordinance and, in effect, the education warrants and taxes. Plaintiffs did not challenge the authority of Jefferson County to levy the education taxes, nor did they contend that the taxes were not levied exclusively for public-school purposes. Instead, plaintiffs challenged Jefferson County's method of distributing the revenues of the education taxes collected under the ordinance. The court held that it was required to presume that the ordinance was reasonable and valid, with the burden resting on plaintiffs to overcome that presumption. The court held that plaintiffs failed to show that the ordinance was not reasonable and valid. The court noted that the tax was well within the authority of Jefferson County and that plaintiffs failed to prove that the financing plan in the ordinance was contrary to the legislative intent for education taxes set forth in Ala. Code &sect; 40-12-4. The court also found that plaintiffs failed to offer any substantial evidence creating genuine issues of material fact on the point that the education warrants exceeded Jefferson County's constitutional debt limit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee homeowners sued appellant, the Board of Water and Sewer Commissioners of the City of Mobile, Alabama, in the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama) for damages from a sewer backup. After the homeowners offered an unlicensed engineer to testify on their behalf and the Board objected, the trial court declared Ala. Code &sect; 34-11-1, as amended by 1997 Ala. Acts 97-683 unconstitutional and enjoined enforcement of the statute. The Board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board pointed out that Ala. Code &sect; 34-11-1(7) said the practice of engineering included testifying, and a license was required to practice engineering. The supreme court held 1997 Ala. Acts 97-683, which amended the statute to include testifying in the practice of engineering, did not violate the single subject rule in Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 45 because it was an amendatory statute which sufficiently stated the statutes it amended, and the substance of the amendment was germane to the existing statute. The legislature could properly find that the requirements for expert testimony in the area of engineering were the same as the requirements for licensure. The homeowners had no standing to argue the statute was void for vagueness, and the expert they offered could not challenge it because it clearly applied to him. The statute was specific enough to allow the public to discern the conduct it sought to prohibit. The statute was not arbitrarily or discriminatorily enforced. It did not violate equal protection as it was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of safeguarding the public health and welfare. The statute did not restrict a litigant's access to the courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded. The trial court's injunction was dissolved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged taxpayer sued the state officials and asserted that to fund its operations, the state securities commission charged and collected certain fees authorized by the state legislature that were specifically earmarked by statute for the benefit of the state securities commission. He also asserted, however, that the state officials had raided funds earmarked for the state securities commission by transferring those funds to the state general fund in violation of the Alabama Constitution and Alabama law. The state officials moved for summary judgment and the trial court granted their motion after holding, inter alia, that the alleged taxpayer did not have standing as a taxpayer to bring the action. On appeal, the state supreme court found that he had not presented substantial evidence that had standing as a taxpayer to bring his action because he had not shown that any deficiency created by the challenged transfers would cause him to be liable for replenishing the public treasury, especially since the state securities commission was self-funded through the collection of fees and was not funded through the receipt of taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 40-2A-7(c)(5)(b), the taxpayer filed a complaint seeking a refund for certain tax years on grounds that Alabama's franchise-tax structure was unconstitutional. Less than two years later, it filed an &quot;amended notice of appeal&quot; to add a subsequent tax year to its complaint. The trial court held that the amended notice of appeal did not strictly comply with the appeal procedures in the Alabama Taxpayers' Bill of Rights (the TBOR), Ala. Code &sect; 40-2A-1 et seq., and violated Ala. R. Civ. P. 15(d) because the taxpayer had not sought leave of the trial court to file it. The appellate court disagreed. First, the TBOR did not require the taxpayer to file an additional refund petition for a tax year occurring after the original notice of appeal was filed, and to pay a new filing fee and serve process on the previously-served Department. Second, as the Department did not file its motion to strike the amended notice of appeal until two and a half years after it had been filed, by which time the taxpayer was time-barred under Ala. Code &sect; 40-2A-7(c)(5)(c) from filing another action, granting the motion to strike severely prejudiced the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a town and a landowner, brought a declaratory judgment action against the Alabama Department of Environment Management (ADEM). Petitioners were awarded interim attorney fees and expenses by the trial court. ADEM appealed the trial court's order, and the Court of Civil Appeals (Alabama) reversed the decision. Petitioners sought certiorari review, which the court granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The declaratory judgment suit arose out of ADEM's approval of the construction of a landfill. In their request for attorney fees, petitioners argued that as a result of their efforts, ADEM had adopted a solid waste plan that benefited the citizens of the county and the state. The lower appellate court held that the award of attorney fees violated Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14, which provided that the State of Alabama could not be made a defendant in any suit at law or equity. Petitioners argued that because the underlying declaratory judgment action fell within an exception to the bar found in &sect; 14, the award of interim attorney fees and expenses likewise was not barred. The court rejected this argument. An action was barred by &sect; 14 when it sought to recover damages or funds from the state treasury. Even if the underlying declaratory judgment action might not have been barred by &sect; 14, an award of interim attorney fees affected the state treasury and divested it of funds in the very way forbidden by &sect; 14. The court rejected petitioners' argument that its ruling should be applied prospectively. Prospective-only application of judgments was disfavored, particularly in constitutional law.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 40-23-4(a)(11) violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. After remand from the state's high court, the trial court granted the taxpayer summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sold crushed stone to Mississippi governmental entities and did not collect Alabama sales tax on those sales. It argued that Alabama's practice of taxing sales to Mississippi governmental entities while exempting identical sales to itself, its counties, and its incorporated municipalities violated the Commerce Clause. The lower courts disagreed, but the high court reversed, holding that Alabama's sales-tax-exemption scheme facially discriminated against interstate commerce and thus was virtually per se invalid. After remand, the trial court took testimony from a revenue agent, who said the tax assessment was based only on transactions in which the Mississippi governmental entities took delivery of the stone in Alabama. The trial court held that the Department failed to justify the discriminatory taxation; however, the intermediate appellate court concluded that the Department's justification was sufficient. The high court held that the Department failed to prove the tax advanced a legitimate local purpose that could not be adequately served by nondiscriminatory alternatives. Administrative convenience was insufficient justification for the discriminatory exemption.</SPAN></P>

They included part of his parole board records, records of his family members' convictions, and entire law enforcement files on his family members. The inmate argued that his family's records would show the violence with which he grew up.</SPAN></P>

His sought mandamus after his conviction was affirmed and his petition for postconviction relief and motion for discovery were denied. He claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective for not seeking the records in question. The court ruled that he had no right to mandamus because he did not show the lack of an alternative. The records of why the board granted parole were public records under Ala. Code &sect; 15-22-36(b), and he had a right to request them. His family members' conviction records were also public records to which he had a right of access. As to the law enforcement files, the court ruled that he failed to show good cause for such do post-conviction discovery under Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.6(b) and that the evidence gained would have entitled him to relief. The record showed that his counsel did present mitigating factors at sentencing about his family's violent home, and the trial court relied on that evidence. Thus, any additional such evidence gained from access to the law enforcement files would have been merely cumulative. It was also apparent that his counsel investigated the family and was not ineffective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient filed a medical malpractice action against the corporation, the first doctor, and the second doctor. After the presentation of evidence, the trial court instructed the jury concerning the burden of proof applicable to a medical malpractice action. The trial court told the jury that the burden was a little different than in a normal civil case because a medical malpractice action required that the patient prove a claim to the jury's reasonable satisfaction by substantial evidence of the truth of the matters and things claimed. The trial court also defined substantial evidence and informed the jury that in a normal civil case, a plaintiff only had to reasonably satisfy the jury of the evidence. The patient objected to the trial court's instruction on the burden of proof based on her contention that the evidence in a medical malpractice case was of a higher character or higher quality, but that the burden of proof remained the same. The trial court overruled the objection. The jury returned a verdict for the corporation, the first doctor, and the second doctor. On appeal, the state supreme court found no reversible error in the manner in which the jury was instructed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that, while an inverse-condemnation action was an exception to the doctrine of state immunity, inverse-condemnation actions were to be brought against state officials in their representative capacity. However, while the State moved to dismiss the case, it voluntarily substituted the proper party-the director of the department of transportation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, appellants, the Alabama Banking Department and check casher customers, challenged an order of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) that held the Alabama Small Loan Act, Ala. Code &sect; 5-18-1 et seq., did not apply to deferred-presentment transactions, commonly referred to as &quot;payday loans,&quot; and the transactions conducted in accordance with a prior consent order were lawful as to the customers and appellee check cashers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Banking Department and the check casher customers claimed the trial court erred in holding that the Alabama Small Loan Act did not apply to the check cashers' deferred-presentment transactions and that the transactions conducted in accordance with a consent order were lawful. The court held that the trial court erred in holding that the deferred-presentment transactions were not subject to the Act because a check cashing transaction became a loan when both parties explicitly agreed to defer presentment of the check for a period of time. Also, the enactment of the Deferred Presentment Services Act, Ala. Code &sect; 5-18A-1 et seq., in 2003 did not mean that there were no laws regulating deferred-presentment transactions before the enactment. The court noted that the fees charged in association with the transactions exceeded the maximum interest rate allowed by the Alabama Small Loan Act, but held that the Department was estopped from enforcing the Act as to the check cashers' transactions that were conducted in accordance with the terms of the consent order. However, the court held that the customers, who were not parties to the consent order, were not bound by its terms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the part of the trial court judgment that held the deferred-presentment transactions were not loans subject to the Alabama Small Loan Act and affirmed the part of the judgment that held that such transactions conducted in accordance with the consent order were legal with regard to the Banking Department, but reversed insofar as it related to the customers. The court remanded the case for further consistent proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff argued that he was entitled to immunity under Ala. Const. art.  I, &sect; 14 because the landowner's remaining claims against him sought to recover monetary damages for acts the sheriff performed while he was working within the line and scope of his employment. The instant court agreed. The landowner did not allege that the sheriff's actions were undertaken for some personal motive to further some personal interest and not as a part of his duties as a deputy sheriff. Instead, the landowner conceded that the sheriff came to his property during the course of his duties. Hence, because uncontroverted averments of fact stated in an answer to the mandamus petition were to be taken as true, the landowner's claims against the sheriff were barred by the doctrine of State immunity. Because the landowner did not seek injunctive or declaratory relief for the actions he alleged were beyond the sheriff's authority, none of the exceptions to State immunity applied. Finally, because the immunity was derived from the performance of his responsibilities as an adjunct to a constitutional officer of this State, the State-agent immunity and its exceptions did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the underlying suit, the taxpayer challenged a decision of the state revenue department to reduce a fee charged to the corporation to dispose of a certain waste at a landfill. The taxpayer did not seek collection of taxes owed by the corporation, but sought a declaration that the tax abatement represented by the reduction in the disposal fee was improper. The issue was whether the taxpayer had standing to bring the suit. The court found that the taxpayer had standing if he was able to demonstrate a probable increase in his tax burden from the challenged activity. Under the revenue department's interpretation and resulting application it appeared that the department would have collected less money than it should have with regard to the disposal of decharacterized waste. Therefore, the recognition of the taxpayer's standing to challenge the department's decision was consistent with, rather than contrary to, the taxpayer's claim of standing. The taxpayer's allegations were specific and were sufficient to withstand the corporation's motion to dismiss. The taxpayer argued that the issue of his standing to pursue the tort claims was moot, and the appellate court agreed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a county commissioner was elected mayor, plaintiff voters filed a complaint seeking, inter alia, a declaration as to whether Ala. Code &sect; 11-3-6, as amended by 2004 Ala. Laws &sect; 455, required the vacancy in the county commission to be filled by a special election. The governor had made public statements indicating that he would fill the vacancy by appointment. The trial court, apparently giving a field of operation to 1985 Ala. Laws &sect; 237, held that the vacancy had to be filled by a special election rather than by appointment. The state supreme court held that because the language of 2004 Ala. Laws &sect; 455 did not clearly indicate an intent by the legislature to cure the impediment to the enforceability that had been found in 1985 Ala. Laws &sect; 237, and because the plain language in 2004 Ala. Laws &sect; 455 provided for prospective application only, a special election was not the proper procedure by which to fill the commission vacancy. Consequently, the governor was authorized to fill the vacancy by appointment. The trial court erred in holding otherwise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an inmate on his own behalf and on the behalf of a proposed class of other inmates, challenged the judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, the Alabama Department of Corrections (DOC), its commissioner, a warden, and Alabama Correctional Industries (ACI). The inmate brought a class action seeking a declaratory judgment that contracting for inmate labor was unlawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DOC had contracted with a sporting goods company to have the inmates inflate sport balls and package them, among other things. The inmate asserted that the DOC and ACI did not have the authority to contract inmate labor to a private company and that the inmate, and other members of the class he assertedly represented, were due back wages for the work they had performed. The trial court ruled that the inmate was not a proper class representative and that his class-action claims were subject to dismissal based on sovereign immunity. The court agreed and held that the inmate's claims for back wages and compensatory damages were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity since the DOC and the ACI were state agencies. The court agreed that the inmate's claim for a declaratory judgment was not barred by sovereign immunity but, because the inmate was not a proper class representative, nor provided proper argument on that issue, the merits of the inmate's substantive argument were not addressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a majority shareholder, challenged the judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which found him liable for wrongdoing with regard to the shareholder-derivative claims brought by appellees, the estates of two deceased minority shareholders, on behalf of the corporation. The case at bar represented the second appeal arising from the suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The majority shareholder was found to have engaged in various acts of misconduct, including receiving excessive compensation. The court concurred with the trial court's conclusion that the evidence established that the majority shareholder had engaged in tortious conduct toward the minority shareholders after the estates became the actual minority shareholders in the corporation after the deaths of the minority shareholders. The court found that the majority shareholder either failed to properly preserve some of his arguments or was attempting to relitigate certain issues on the second appeal. The court did find error on the part of the trial court in permitting the same conduct to serve as the basis for a derivative action and for the tort claims of squeeze-out and oppression, which only harmed the minority stockholders individually. As such, the court reversed the portion of the trial court's judgment awarding damages on the conversion and tax penalty claims, instructing that, on remand, the entire amount for such damages was awarded to the corporation, not the estates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment as to attorney fees and compensatory damages based on the excessive compensation, loss of rental income, diversion of corporate opportunities, and corporate waste claims. The court reversed the judgment as to the damages for conversion and tax penalties incurred, and the case was remanded to assign such damages to the corporation. The punitive damages award was also reversed, with a new trial ordered on that issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney sought a writ of mandamus seeking an order directing respondent, the Alabama State Bar (Bar), to set aside a restraining order suspending him, on an interim basis, from the practice of law without giving him notice of an opportunity to be heard. In the alternative, the attorney sought an order pursuant to Ala. R. Disc. P. 20 dissolving the restraining order. The Bar moved for dismissal, and this matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney alleged that depriving him of his law practice violated his due process rights. The instant court agreed, first concluding that because the right to practice law was a property right, and that one could not be deprived of a license to do the same without notice and an opportunity to be heard, the Bar's actions denied the attorney due process. Further, in adopting rules governing the discipline of lawyers, the instant court could no infringe upon constitutional rights. Thus, the court held that a rule allowing for the interim suspension of a lawyer who was not convicted of a serious crime, only after notice and an opportunity to be heard in all but genuine emergency circumstances, would both provide the affected lawyer with the necessary minimum requirements of due process and allow the Bar to fulfill its duty to protect the public from harm. Hence, by separate order, the court revised Ala. R. Disc. P. 20(a) and 20(d).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sued appellee executive-branch officials, seeking a declaration that Ala. Code &sect; 29-2-123, and 2004 Ala. Acts 456 insofar as it appropriated money to fund community-services grants, violated the separation-of-powers provisions of the Alabama Constitution. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) granted intervenor legislative committee's motion to intervene, and entered judgment for the officials. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint averred that the granting of funds appropriated under 2004 Ala. Acts 456 for expenditure by the Alabama Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Community Services Grants, a committee of the legislature, as set forth in Ala. Code &sect; 29-2-123, encroached powers reserved to the executive branch of government by the Alabama Constitution. The taxpayer argued, in effect, that the separation-of-powers doctrine forbade the legislature from executing the laws it enacted, which the challenged statutory scheme purported to allow. The supreme court noted that the exercise of discretion in determining when and how to distribute funds was an executive function. The Committee's discretion in disbursing funds was unbridled, except for the fact that the money had to be used for educational purposes and that minimum equal percentages were earmarked for each house and senate district. Disbursements of the appropriated funds under the challenged legislation were not, therefore, ministerial acts. By enacting &sect; 29-2-123, the legislature usurped the executive branch's role in violation of the separation-of-powers doctrine set forth in Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 42, 43.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant appeal hinged on whether the employee established by substantial evidence that there was a termination of employment within the meaning of Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-11.1. The undisputed facts at trial showed that (1) the employer was engaged in a bona fide layoff in October, 2000 resulting from a slowdown in business; (2) the employee's seniority and job position made him subject to that layoff; (3) the employee was separated from his employment; and (4) the employee was subsequently recalled from layoff by the employer in accordance with its layoff policy. In light of these facts, there was no termination of the employee's employment. Hence, he was precluded from recovering under &sect; 25-5-11.1. Moreover, the employee suffered no injury as a result of his filing a claim for workers' compensation benefits. Based on this finding, the appeals court chose not to address the employer's argument that the award of damages was excessive.</SPAN></P>

The property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners were the owners of a parcel of land located adjacent to an unpaved public county road maintained by the county. Within its right-of-way, the county provided routine maintenance to unpaved public roads by scraping the roadway and clearing the ditches beside the road to allow for water drainage. Eventually, the property owners planted pine trees just outside the right-of-way. Thereafter, a county employee operating a grading machine within the scope of his employment destroyed many of the pine trees. The property owners sued the county, the county commission, and the county commission members. The property owners described the factual background giving rise to their claims, the alleged basis for the county's liability for damages resulting from the event, the nature of the damages, and the compensation demanded. However, the trial court grant the motion to dismiss filed by the county, county commission, and county commission members. On appeal, the state supreme court found the trial court erred in dismissing the claims because the claims, filed pursuant to Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 53 specifically committed to each house of the legislature the power to determine the rules of its own proceedings. However, the Alabama Constitution contained no identifiable textual limitation on the legislature's authority with respect to voting procedures that permitted judicial review of those procedures. There was also a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving whether the House of Representatives constitutionally passed both Act No. 288 and Act No. 357. Finally, for the judicial branch to declare that the legislature's procedure for determining that a bill has passed via a judicial opinion would be to express a lack of the respect due that coordinate branch of government. For each of these three reasons, the case presented before the instant court was a non-justiciable political question and, thus, was not reviewed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) granted appellee Chief Justice's motion to dismiss appellant taxpayers' complaint requesting that the Chief Justice be ordered to repay the State of Alabama for costs incurred as a result of actions he took in a parallel federal action. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged the judgment entered against them, contending that the Chief Justice made statements and arguments during the federal monument litigation that were calculated to result in his losing the case. Further, they alleged that he and his counsel failed and refused to assert the only feasible defense available, that the monolith was a historic, not religious, installation. The Chief Justice responded, arguing that the taxpayers lacked standing to seek the requested relief under Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-4, as only the Governor could initiate an action thereunder, and that the Governor did not do so in the instant case. The appeals court agreed with the Chief Justice. Thus, the taxpayers did not have the right to recover state funds wrongfully expended by, or caused to be wrongfully expended by, a public officer. Further, although &sect; 6-5-4 provided a method for the recovery of wrongfully expended funds, it did not provide the exclusive method for the same. Hence, their status as taxpayers was insufficient to confer upon them standing to sue a state official to recover public funds allegedly wrongfully expended because of the acts of that official.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A taxpayer challenged a decision from the Lowndes Circuit Court (Alabama), which entered an order in favor of a development district by validating the issuance and sale of bonds for the purpose of financing an industrial manufacturing facility in a county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district entered into a funding agreement with the county to finance an industrial plant. The district filed seeking to validate the revenue bonds proposed. The taxpayer filed a motion to dismiss. After the trial court entered an order in favor of the district, the taxpayer sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction. Despite the error, the district could have existed as a de facto corporation. And, because the incorporation error was corrected by a county commission in an amendment, the district had standing to bring the action. However, the contractual arrangement structured by the funding agreement violated Ala. Const. art. XII, &sect; 224, as amended by Ala. Const. amend. 342, by creating an absolute debt at once, payable over the course of many years out of future collections of existing tax revenues otherwise destined for the county's general fund. No new tax or revenue source was created to help fund the retirement of the bond indebtedness; rather, the components of the county tax revenues were all established and existing revenue sources for the county's general fund. There was no yearly recurring &quot;quid pro quo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court was reversed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hospital sought review from the judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court, Bessemer Division (Alabama), that denied its motion for a new trial, following a judgment entered on a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff patient in the patient's medical-malpractice action against the hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying its motion for a new trial because the jury's verdict was contrary to the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. The supreme court disagreed. The gynecological procedure contained a list of 13 directives. Two doctors testified that the procedure list was a set of standing orders that the group had given the hospital and that those orders were applicable to the patient. They also testified that the procedures required the nursing staff to administer preoperative antibiotics to the patient. Although the hospital presented the testimony of nurses and others who disputed the doctors' testimony, the jury evidently believed the doctors, as it was entitled to do. In short, the trial court did not err in denying the hospital's motion for a new trial based on the hospital's argument that it did not breach an applicable standard of care in failing to administer a preoperative antibiotic to the patient. The hospital conceded that evidence was presented to the jury indicating that it had been given such a standing order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, who was a resident of defendant town, and plaintiff, a political committee caring for children, sued the town and defendant mayor, seeking a declaration that 2002 Ala. Acts 362 was unconstitutional, that an August 12, 2003 election void, and an injunction to prevent the town from allowing liquor sales pursuant to the election. The Cherokee Circuit Court, Alabama, granted the requested relief. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court decided that plaintiffs did not have standing to contest, nor could it address, defendants' actions or the Act's constitutionality under Ala. Const. &sect; 105 (1901). The Act provided that a town with a population of 1,300 to 1,500 could determine by a local option election whether alcoholic beverages could be legally sold in the town. The August 12, 2003 election decided that alcoholic beverages could be legally sold in the town. Plaintiffs primary argument was that the Act was unconstitutional. If the Act was declared unconstitutional, then the election would have to be invalidated and liquor sales not permitted. Plaintiffs did not have U.S. Const. art. III standing to contest the constitutionality of the Act because they did not state their injuries with particularity. Ala. Code &sect; 17-15-1 did not grant standing to contest the constitutionality of the Act. Ala. Code &sect; 28-2A-3, passed in 1984, and Ala. Code &sect; 28-2A-4,which limited alcohol sales in towns less than 7,000 and 4,000 population could not be considered apart from the Act; the Alabama Legislature was presumed to have reconciled any policy differences when it passed the Act.</SPAN></P>
