On a second motion for post-conviction relief, a jury of the District Court of Mcintosh County, Oklahoma, found he was not mentally retarded. The trial court declared a mistrial and granted the State's motion to terminate further proceedings. Petitioner appealed the trial court's termination of the mental retardation proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Okla. Stat. art. 21, &sect; 701.10b (Supp. 2006) was applicable to the remand determination of whether petitioner was mentally retarded, notwithstanding the statement by the court that &sect; 701.10b(H) was not applicable during mandatory sentence review. Further, no plain error occurred under due process or Eighth Amendment principles when the district court granted the State's motion to terminate further proceedings. Petitioner received intelligence quotients of 80 and 82 on individually administered, scientifically recognized, standardized intelligence quotient tests and thus was not entitled to a jury trial on his claim of mental retardation. The court found that &sect; 701.10b(C), disqualifying any defendant from being considered mentally retarded for the purpose of a sentence of death if that individual has received an intelligence quotient of 76 or above on any scientifically recognized intelligence quotient test, is constitutional. There was no violation of ex post facto principles, as the statute does not criminalize an act after the act has been committed and does not increase the severity of the crime or the punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the finding that petitioner was not mentally retarded and denied his second application for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court violated his right to a fair and impartial jury by removing prospective jurors for cause over objection and absent proper questioning before it was adequately established that those jurors could not follow the law and consider the death penalty. As defendant had already been found guilty of first degree murder, the primary issue in jury selection was whether potential jurors could consider all three potential punishments. Defendant complained that the trial court removed 22 jurors for cause because the jurors were unable to consider imposing the death penalty, over his objection and without allowing him to rehabilitate the jurors. Of those 22 potential jurors, five were questioned as alternates. The court upheld the decision because defendant could not show prejudice from any alleged error that may have occurred when questioning the jurors because the record did not show that any alternate jurors sat on his jury. The court also held that it was harmless error when the trial judge left the bench during videotaped testimony that was offered in mitigation. The error was not structural in nature because there was no prejudice from the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the District Court of Blaine County (Oklahoma) of first degree murder, shooting with intent to kill, grand larceny, and possession of a firearm after conviction of a felony. He was sentenced to death for first degree murder, imprisonment for life for shooting with intent to kill, twenty-five years for grand larceny, and forty years for possession of a firearm after former conviction of a felony. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the district court committed reversible error by failing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offenses of second degree murder and first degree heat of passion or misdemeanor manslaughter and other lesser offenses applicable to the non-capital charges. The court of criminal appeals disagreed. Defendant's admission of guilt to the charges, through numerous statements of his counsel during trial, constituted a valid strategic election to present only a sentencing stage defense. By electing a sentencing stage defense, defendant foreclosed his claim to first-stage jury instructions on lesser-included offenses. The district court's failure to instruct the jury on lesser-included offenses did not &quot;go to the foundation of the case&quot; or take from the defendant any &quot;right essential to his defense,&quot; and thus was not plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the trial court did not err in admitting the recording of the 911 call during the first stage of trial because it was admissible to corroborate witness testimony about the condition of the victim as well as the conversation had between the victim and the man who made the 911 call. Further, the victim's audible moans did not render the recording more prejudicial than probative under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2403 (Supp. 2002). The 911 tape was also properly admitted in the trial's second stage to support the aggravating circumstance that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel because it showed the victim's conscious physical suffering before his death; the fact that defendant did not contest the suffering of the victim did not make the recording more prejudicial than probative. The State had the burden to prove each aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, and the 911 tape was convincing proof.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the trial court did not err in admitting the results of a Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test without scientific foundation by expert witnesses because the results, predicated by a proper foundation, were to be considered in the same manner as other field sobriety tests, such as the walk and turn test and the one-leg stand test. The testimony of the arresting deputies provided a proper foundation for the admission of the HGN, and the deputies were sufficiently qualified to administer the test. The testimony relating to the HGN test results was not offered as independent scientifically sound evidence of defendant's intoxication but was offered for the same purpose as other field sobriety test evidence--a physical act by defendant observed by the deputies contributing to the cumulative portrait of defendant as intoxicated in the deputies' opinions. Further, a scientific foundation for the test was not required because field sobriety tests were not based upon scientific evidence and were not a scientific test requiring scientific reliability. Therefore, neither Fry, Daubert, nor any other test establishing reliability or trustworthiness was applicable.</SPAN></P>

Testimony from a firearms examiner showed that the handgun defendant used was unusual in that it required several sequential steps to be fired a second time, and after he shot the victim the second time, defendant remained barricaded in the house, even though there were police and emergency medical personnel just outside that could have aided the victim. When the evidence was considered in the light most favorable to the State, it was sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to conclude that defendant intended to kill the victim with either the first or second gunshot despite some evidence showing that he was intoxicated but not so intoxicated that his mental powers were overcome rendering him incapable of forming criminal intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the capital sentenced imposed by the District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, following his second re-sentencing trial, arguing that crime scene photographs were improperly admitted in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2403 (2001), and that the evidence was insufficient to support the finding of an aggravator factor under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.12(4) (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's second re-sentencing trial, the jury found the existence of the aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.12(4), and recommended imposition of the death sentence. The district court accepted the jury's recommendation and imposed a capital sentence. On review, the court held that photographs of the deceased and crime scene were properly admitted because they proved the existence of the &quot;heinous, atrocious or cruel&quot; aggravator. Further, the court rejected defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient to support the finding of the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating factor because the evidence on this issue was profoundly compelling. The properly admitted evidence overwhelmingly established that defendant inflicted serious physical abuse inflicted upon his victim in attempting to rape her that resulted in conscious physical suffering by the victim until defendant delivered the final crushing blows with a coat rack that pierced the victim's skull and ended her life.</SPAN></P>

Following his convictions, the trial court imposed a capital sentence. On review, the court held that the trial court did not err in admitting a witness statement in its entirety. Under the rule of completeness, codified at Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2107 (Supp. 2002), a party that introduced part of a statement could not object when the adverse party sought to introduce the previously unintroduced portion. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony of a fellow inmate that defendant admitted to committing the murders because evidence that a defendant relayed details of a crime that only the perpetrator could have known was relevant evidence. In addition, in light of the heinous nature of the crime committed, the evidence was sufficient to support the finding of the continuing threat aggravator under 21 Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.12(7) (2001), to justify the capital sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial in the District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma, defendant was found guilty of trafficking in illegal drugs, Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-415 (Supp. 2004); possession of marijuana, second offense, Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-402 (Supp. 2004); and failure to obtain a drug tax stamp, Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 450.3 (2001), and was sentenced to, among other things, life imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police received a tip regarding the sale of drugs in an apartment; the officers testified that the person who answered the apartment door consented to a search and voluntarily signed the search warrant waiver and consent form. The officer observed defendant near a bedroom and found drugs on defendant. The court disagreed with defendant's argument that this trial was barred by former jeopardy. During the previous trial, defendant's counsel consistently turned down the trial judge's offer to declare a mistrial for the impermissible injection of evidentiary harpoons, Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2403 (2004). When an experienced trial court concluded that defendant's rights to a fair and impartial trial and effective assistance of counsel were irreparably compromised, it was faced with a cogent and compelling reason to order a mistrial and discharge the jury. There was no abuse of discretion in this ruling and no former acquittal which barred defendant's retrial and conviction. The officers were in the apartment based on a co-inhabitant's consent and plainly viewed defendant in possession of drugs. Therefore, there was no unreasonable search and seizure, Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 30.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of an Oklahoma trial court that convicted him of two counts of first-degree rape under Okla. Stat. art. 21, &sect;&sect; 1111 and 1114 (Supp. 2006) and two counts of kidnapping under Okla. Stat. art. 21, &sect; 741 (Supp. 2004), arguing that the joinder of the charges against him in a single trial was erroneous and that the trial court erred in precluding him from impeaching a victim regarding her history of prostitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate instances, each victim agreed to go somewhere with defendant in his car but were instead brought to his home, where they were attacked and raped. Although the instances occurred one week apart, charges stemming from both incidents were joined. On review, the court held that the charges were properly joined because both encounters displayed defendant's unique predatory pattern and common plan of attack and because evidence of the pattern and common plan was relevant to proving both kidnappings and both rapes. Further, the trial court did not err in precluding defendant from impeaching one of the victim's regarding her history of prostitution. Prior convictions under Okla. Stat. art. 12, &sect; 2609(A) (Supp. 2004), were admissible if they involved dishonesty, and Okla. Stat. art. 12, &sect; 2609(B) did not make crimes regarding moral turpitude, by themselves, generally admissible for impeachment purposes. Further, Oklahoma's rape shield statute, Okla. Stat. art. 12, &sect; 2412 (2001), contained no exception allowing for a complainant's history of prostitution, either acts or convictions, to be brought out at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the district erred under Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 15 (2001), in acquiescing to the request of law enforcement personnel that defendant be shackled because the statute required a factual predicate sufficient to justify the restraint and no showing was made. However, because care was taken to conceal the restraints and no juror observed them, defendant suffered no prejudice. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions because it tended to show that defendant forced the victim into her car, sexually assaulted her, murdered her, dumped her body, and took some of her belongings with him where DNA evidence extracted from sperm was found in the vehicle, on the victim, and on her clothing, where phone calls made from the victim's phone after her murder were placed to defendant's then-girlfriend, and where footprints of a Nike tread pattern were found at the scene and defendant owned shoes with the same tread pattern and of the same size. After reviewing the evidence and finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating evidence, the court concluded that the sentence of death was factually supported and appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma) of trafficking in controlled drugs under Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-415 (Supp. 2004). He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and a fine of $ 25,000, all but $ 500 suspended. The judgment showed that he convicted after conviction of a prior offense. Defendant appealed. He was also convicted in non-jury proceedings of failure to signal under Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 11-604 (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised various issues on appeal, but the court affirmed.  Defendant could not waive his right to a jury trial without the consent of the State. Although defendant attempted to waive a jury trial, he had no right to unilaterally waive jury assessment of punishment. Any rational trier of fact could have found that defendant failed to signal before turning and that failure might have affected other traffic, which supported his conviction in this regard. An officer testified that he saw defendant turn without signaling and there was no opposing testimony. Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-415 (Supp. 2004) did not presume that trafficking defendants were major drug dealers. The court rejected defendant's claim that the statute violated due process. To prove his equal protection claim, defendant had to show that Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-415 (Supp. 2004) interfered with his exercise of a fundamental right or operated to his disadvantage as a member of a suspect class, or show that the statute was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Treating some differently by the enactment of the trafficking statute does not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of Seminole County (Oklahoma) convicting him for three counts of first degree murder, under Okla. Stat. art. 21, &sect; 701.7 (2001), and one count of shooting with intent to kill, in violation of Okla. Stat. art. 21, &sect; 652 (2001).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant waived his right to a direct appeal, stated that he had nothing to present in mitigation, and requested a death sentence. On a mandatory sentence review for all death-penalty cases, pursuant to Okla. Stat. art. 21, &sect; 701.13 (2001) and Okla. R. Ct. Crim. App. 9.4, the court considered whether the crimes occurred in Indian County such that the State lacked jurisdiction. The murders occurred in a house located on property that was part of the original restricted allotment of a full-blooded Seminole, and 4/5ths of the surface interests in the property remained restricted against alienation as Indian land. The court held that the State's interest in exercising criminal jurisdiction over the property overwhelmed any fractional interest any Indian heirs of the original allottee might own in the unseen mineral estate. The court found that the sentence imposed was based upon aggravated circumstances that were supported by the evidence and were not under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, pursuant to the sentence review procedure under Okla. Stat. art. 21, &sect; 701.12. Defendant had an opportunity to present mitigating evidence and chose not to do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the District Court of Washita County (Oklahoma), which sentenced him to death after he was convicted of first-degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried by a jury and convicted of kidnapping, rape and first degree murder. He currently appealed from his sentence of death, but the appellate court affirmed. Two panelists initially expressed reservations about aspects of capital punishment that would have cat doubt on their fitness for jury service. However, each panelist said that she was able to consider all of the evidence presented and give meaningful and fair consideration to all three punishments. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying the challenges for cause. While the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow defendant's expert witness to use demonstrative aids during his testimony, witnesses were able to present a great deal of information regarding defendant's development and factors related to his ability to make good decisions. The record showed that jurors were able to use that information in their deliberations. The death penalty was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. Sufficient evidence supported the aggravating circumstances and no improper evidence or argument was admitted that could have unfairly swayed the jury's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed two employees of a hotel and took money from the hotel register and from the purse of one of the victims. Defendant first contended that he was incompetent to stand trial due to a mental illness. The court held that defendant was competent under the standards of Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1175.1 (2005) because there was no reason to second-guess the judgments of defense counsel, the trial court, and the defense experts that determined that defendant was competent at the time of his trial. Where defendant wrote a letter indicating that he wished to be relieved of counsel several weeks before trial and where the trial court failed to conduct a hearing on his request, the record did not support a conclusion that defendant made a clear, unequivocal expression of the desire to waive the assistance of counsel and to proceed pro se. Defendant was not denied a fair trial regarding the composition of the jury. The robberies had a sufficient separation of time and place to justify the two convictions and did not violate double jeopardy principles, under U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, and Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma, that convicted him of rape by instrumentation under Okla.

Stat. art. 21, &sect; 1123 (2002), arguing that the trial court erred in permitting his former stepdaughter to testify that he had sexually abused her years earlier.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sexually abusing a four-year-old girl. The girl, who was nine at the time of trial, testified that defendant placed his finger in her vagina and his penis in her mouth and had ejaculated in her mouth on more than one occasion. The State also presented testimony from defendant's former stepdaughter, who testified that defendant had abused her in the same manner. On review of defendant's convictions, the court held that the trial court did not err in admitting the testimony of his former stepdaughter. The mere fact that retroactively-applied evidentiary laws Okla. Stat. art. 12, &sect; 2413 (2007), and Okla. Stat. art. 12, &sect; 2414 (2007), worked to defendant's disadvantage did not mean that the laws were ex post facto. Further, the testimony of defendant's former stepdaughter was admissible under these statutes because the particulars of the prior crime showed a visible connection to the instant charge and demonstrated a common scheme to take advantage of very young girls. Both the instant offense and the past offense involved girls about the same age, and the girls gave contemporaneous descriptions of defendant's conduct that were eerily similar to each other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, that convicted him of rape under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1114 (1991), and forcible oral sodomy under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 888 (Supp. 1992), arguing that the trial court erred in admitting propensity evidence under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2413 (Supp. 2007), and that the statute of limitations, Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 152 (1994), barred his prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defendant's trial for the sexual abuse of his stepdaughter, the trial court permitted a witness with whom defendant has consensual sex to testify to statements defendant made regarding his sexual preferences. On review, the court held that the propensity evidence was admissible under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2413 (Supp. 2007), and that the statute did not violate due process or equal protection concerns. The introduction of prior acts evidence was limited by Okla. Stat. tit. 12 Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect;&sect; 2402 and 2403 (2001), which ensured that such evidence would not be admitted if its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. Sex crimes were crimes of propensity, and the need for corroborating evidence in cases of child sexual abuse due to the highly secretive nature of the crime justified the admission of prior crimes evidence. Further, the statute of limitations did not bar prosecution. Although more than seven years had passed since the commission of the offenses, the victim told no one about the crimes because she was afraid of defendant, who had been a police officer. While she remained silent about defendant's sexual abuse, the statute of limitations was tolled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, the State challenged the order of the Oklahoma County District Court, Oklahoma, quashing the grand jury indictments brought against defendants and suppressing evidence taken by the multicounty grand jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants alleged the presence of two alternate jurors in the grand jury room while evidence was being taken violated of Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 18 and Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 340(C) (2001). The State argued that the presence of alternate jurors in the grand jury proceedings during the reception of evidence was authorized by Okla. Stat. tit. 38, &sect; 21 (Supp. 2004). In a plurality opinion, the court ruled that Okla. Stat. tit. 38, &sect; 21 was constitutional and the presence of the alternate grand jurors in the grand jury room and their participation during the evidentiary phase of the proceedings was proper. By reading Okla. Stat. tit. 22 &sect; 340(C) and Okla. Stat. tit. 38, &sect; 21 together it was clear that the Oklahoma Legislature intentionally expanded the list of who could be present in the grand jury room during its proceedings to include alternate jurors. Alternate grand jurors provided by Okla. Stat. tit. 38, &sect; 21 were fully compatible with Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 18, and there was no limitation on the number of persons who could be qualified as alternate grand or petit jurors in anticipation of exercising fact-finding powers if a regular juror was unable to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, convicted defendant, after a bench trial, of taking clandestine photographs, under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1171(B) (2001), after conviction of a felony. The trial court sentenced defendant to six years in prison, provided that on successful completion of certain behavioral programs, the balance of the sentence would have been suspended. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence presented at the bench trial showed that defendant had used a digital camera, hidden in a backpack, to take photographs of a female student in the lobby of a community college without her knowledge. The evidence supported a conclusion that defendant had intentionally tried to position the backpack so that the camera, nestled inside an open compartment of the pack, would have captured images of the student's body underneath her skirt. Defendant claimed that any attempt to clandestinely photograph any part of a person, while the person was in a public place, was not a crime under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1171(B) (2001). The plain language of &sect; 1171(B) referred to one's reasonable expectation of privacy while &quot;in&quot; a particular place, not to one's expectations about a particular place &quot;on&quot; one's body. The court did not believe that &sect; 1171(B) covered the clandestine taking of photographs of a person who was in a public place, regardless of what part of the body the perpetrator focused on. Accordingly, defendant's conviction must have been reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was charged as an adult with first-degree murder. The alleged crime occurred when the juvenile was 17 years old. The juvenile sought certification to be tried as a youthful offender or a juvenile. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the juvenile claimed that a bill enacted in 2007 revising the Oklahoma Youthful Offender Act provisions then codified at Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 7306-2.2 and 7306-2.5 (Supp. 2006) was unconstitutional because it was passed in violation of the anti-logrolling and single-subject provisions of Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 57. The court found that the bill was a valid legislative enactment under art. 5, &sect; 57 as a bill adopting a revision of statutes. The Oklahoma Legislature intended, through the bill, only to revise duplicate bills, which amended the same sections of the Youthful Offender Act in order to merge them and to reconcile any conflicts therein. The trial court properly denied the juvenile's motion for youthful offender status based on Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 7306-2.2 and 7306-2.5 ( Supp. 2007). The statutes were not unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, Spanish-speaking defendants in criminal matters, were in court to be sentenced for unrelated charges when the judge asked them about their legal status in the country. Their answers led him to order petitioners committed to the custody of the sheriff. The judge relied on House Bill 1804, the Oklahoma Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act of 2007, 2007 Okla. Sess. Laws ch. 112, &sect; 1, at 546, which he believed required him to notify the sheriff of persons illegally in the country. The court found that House Bill 1804 did not authorize petitioners' commitment. However, under Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 201 (2001), giving the judge power to command the arrest of a person when an offense was committed in his presence, the judge could lawfully order the sheriff to take custody of petitioners. The court also found that the judge had legal authority to question petitioners regarding their immigration status during the sentencing hearing. However, under 8 C.F.R. &sect; 287.7(d) (2007), petitioners were required to be released once the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement failed to take any action against petitioners within 48 hours of detainer notices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police were preparing to execute a search warrant at a residence, and observed defendant and another male leave the house and drive away in defendant's car. The vehicle was stopped for a traffic violation. Defendant was arrested and returned to the residence where he remained until the search was completed. At the residence, police executing the warrant found 326.5 grams of methamphetamine and approximately twenty pounds of marijuana in a safe in defendant's bedroom. After he was Mirandized, defendant admitted he had been selling drugs for about six months, and stated that he sold approximately four pounds of methamphetamine and twenty pounds of marijuana a week. The appellate court ruled that while the police used a traffic violation to justify the stop in the case, such was not necessary to detain defendant while his residence was being searched pursuant to a lawful search warrant for contraband based upon a finding of probable cause. The police sought to detain defendant while they executed a lawful warrant to search his home for contraband. Although defendant was stopped about a mile from his home, this was, under the circumstances, as soon as practicable.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 565.1 (2001) in the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma). The matter was transferred to another district judge who, after a hearing, found defendant in direct contempt and ordered him to pay a fine, plus the amount of costs to the State resulting from his conduct. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant represented a client whose conviction had been reversed on appeal. Defendant believed that certain evidence was admissible at trial; however, the trial judge ruled that the evidence was inadmissible. Before the jury, nevertheless, defendant made reference to the inadmissible evidence. The dispositive question before the appellate court was whether defendant's conduct constituted direct contempt of court under the circumstances presented here. That was a question of law and appellate review was de novo. That the district court's order in the case could have been wrong was simply not relevant. Wrong or not, it was the order of the district court. Further, the appellate court determined that the statement to the jury was neither a slip of the tongue, nor an outburst made in an unguarded moment of passion. It was made in cool, calculated, contemptuous defiance of the district court's authority and with full awareness of the potential consequences. Moreover, defendant's conduct was not tempered as client zealous advocacy. To defy the district court's order in front of the jury was simply bad behavior and direct contempt of court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court in finding the defendant guilty of direct contempt was affirmed. The fine was also affirmed; however, the order directing payment of costs was set aside and held for naught.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for shooting the victim, a highway patrol trooper, to death while the trooper was attempting to arrest defendant for manufacturing methamphetamine in his car. On appeal, the court held that even though the jury instructions concerning the defense of voluntary intoxication were incorrect, the error was harmless because the evidence against defendant was overwhelming and clearly established that defendant knew what he was doing and deliberately chose to shoot and kill the victim. However, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to constrain the amount and content of the victim impact evidence presented during sentencing, erred by failing to hold a hearing on the admissibility of the evidence, and defense counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the evidence. The error was not harmless because, while defendant might have only had a slim chance of avoiding a death sentence, the religious and duty-based plea of the victim's wife that defendant be shown no mercy squelched whatever slim chance he had. The overall victim impact evidence was too long and too emotional.</SPAN></P>

In making these claims, he alleged trial counsel was ineffective in several instances and appellate counsel was ineffective for not raising these claims. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that the petitioner offered examples of ineffective assistance of counsel, either by counsel, appellate counsel, or both. Insofar as the petitioner intended to separately raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel at the first trial, the appellate court denied those claims. In reference to several of the petitioner's other claims, he failed to show the alleged acts of ineffectiveness prejudiced him; these included claims that some of the prosecutor's statements to the jury were improper, and claims that certain evidence seized by the State should have been found by counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not plainly err in failing to use the recommended instructions on jury note-taking where it told jurors that notes were for their personal use only and otherwise properly instructed the jury. The failure to provide a complete record of the sentence proceedings did not violate defendant's constitutional rights where the record was complete enough for the appellate court to evaluate the jury's verdict. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding on the continuing threat aggravating circumstance where the evidence showed that defendant had a lifelong pattern of using violence that was likely to continue. Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect;&sect; 12.1 and 13.1 (2001), did not apply as defendant's crimes were committed prior to March 1, 2000. The initial prosecutorial argument that the jury should not consider mitigating evidence was harmless where the jury was properly instructed as to the consideration of mitigating evidence. The claims of ineffective assistance of counsel failed as defendant was not prejudiced by counsel's failure to, inter alia, seek a determination that he was mentally retarded or to present evidence of his diminished mental capacity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the District Court of Rogers County (Oklahoma), which convicted him of first-degree murder in violation of Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his first-degree murder conviction, but the appellate court affirmed. The victim was his nine-month old daughter. He had tried to get her to stop crying, grabbed her by the ankles, and pushed her legs toward her head until she flipped over. The action broke the child's back and resulted in fatal injuries. The denial of defendant's motion for continuance 12 days before trial was proper because the decision to cut off the window of opportunity for developing even better evidence did not amount to an abuse of discretion. Moreover, there was no ineffective assistance of trial counsel with respect to the way the defense team handled the issue and no prejudice, as no evidence had apparently been developed in the two years since defendant's trial occurred. His prior criminal conviction and prison sentence in California for aggravated child abuse was appropriately admitted because that evidence was inextricably intertwined with the State's investigation of the current case and connected to its burden of proof. More importantly, some of the evidence went to intent, an exception found in Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2404(B) (2001).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) convicting him of first-degree murder in violation of Okla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his co-defendant were convicted for shooting the victim, the co-defendant's husband, to death. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion for a change of venue based on pretrial publicity because defendant did not show that any juror actually seated was biased against him due to adverse pretrial publicity; the trial court excused a number of prospective jurors who admitted that pretrial publicity had affected their ability to be impartial. Defendant's convictions for both first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder did not violate the prohibitions against double jeopardy or the prohibition against double punishment of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 11 (2001) because the fact that evidence of a plan to profit financially from the victim's murder was relevant to both the conspiracy charge and the murder for remuneration aggravating circumstance supporting the death penalty for the murder charge did not offend double jeopardy principles. The murder, and the plan to commit it, were not the same act as contemplated by &sect; 11 as neither crime was an indispensable part of the other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which, according to a jury verdict, sentenced defendant to death for first degree murder in violation of Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, his brother, and two women decided that the women would pretend to be prostitutes and that the brothers would arrive at the motel later to rob two men. One victim was stabbed to death during a struggle. The jury found that defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person, that the murder was especially heinous or cruel, and that defendant posed a continuing threat to society under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.12 (2), (4) and (7) (2001). On appeal, the court found that Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 860.1 and Okla. Stat. tit. 21 &sect; 701.10 (2001) did not prohibit the State from seeking to enhance defendant's noncapital offenses with proof of a prior conviction. The aggravating factors were not vague or broad as applied in violation of U.S. Const. amends. VII and XIV, and substantial evidence of the struggle and danger to the second victim substantially supported the factors. Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim under U.S. Const. amend. VI failed because he could not show that the outcome of his case would have been different had the credible evidence developed at the evidentiary hearing been presented during his capital sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review from a judgment of the District Court of Beckham County (Oklahoma), which after a trial de novo affirmed a municipal court's decision adverse to appellee on two counts of violating a city ordinance prohibiting inoperative or junk vehicles and reversed a finding of guilt as to four counts, dismissing those charges. The appeal was transferred to the court from the Oklahoma Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city sought to reinstate the decision of the municipal court as to the reversed counts. Appellee argued that the appeal should be dismissed because the city did not properly comply with the requirements of Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1053 for appeals by the state. The court dismissed the appeal. The city's appeal from a judgment of the district court on a trial de novo of a case appealed from a municipal court not of record for the violation of a city ordinance was a criminal matter under Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 27-102, 27-103, and the city's right to appeal was not expressly authorized under &sect; 1053. Additionally, neither Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1053.1 nor Okla. R. Ct. Crim. App. 6.1, Okla. Stat. tit. 22, ch. 18, app., applied in that the city did not properly reserve a question of law in the district court and no statute was found unconstitutional. Finally, case law interpreting Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 27-132, 28-128 had limited the right to appeal to a criminal defendant and not the state or municipality. Therefore, because the city did not meet the requirements of Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1053 for an appeal by a municipality, the city's appeal was not properly before the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of Grady County (Oklahoma) convicting him of first-degree murder under Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for killing his wife. On appeal, the court held that the record supported the trial court's conclusion that defendant was competent to stand trial because the information available at the time of trial from several experts, including one chosen by defendant, gave neither defense counsel nor the trial court any material reason to believe that defendant's competency was in doubt. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because his history of jealousy, his conduct in the days preceding the homicide, his scheme to get his wife to accompany him alone after she had moved out, the presence of a large knife in his car, defendant's own statements, and the nature of the wounds inflicted all supported the jury's conclusion that defendant deliberately meant to kill his wife. Defense counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately present mitigation evidence during defendant's sentencing. Modification of defendant's death sentence was appropriate, as evidence supporting the continuing threat to society aggravating factor was weak, defendant had no known criminal record, and evidence of his mental illness was considerable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.12(3) (Supp. 1996), and set the punishment at death. The District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, formally sentenced him in accordance with the jury verdict.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a motel manager, was convicted of hiring a maintenance worker, the perpetrator, to kill the owner. The perpetrator's corroborating testimony was sufficient direct evidence to support appellant's conviction on a theory of aiding and abetting, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 172 (2001): the perpetrator was completely dependent on appellant for work, food, and housing; it was appellant's idea to kill the owner; and he offered the perpetrator a large sum of money to commit the crime. The State also pointed out other aspects of appellant's involvement, other than the money, which pointed to his guilt: motive, concealment of the crime, intended flight, and his control over the perpetrator. Additionally, there was sufficient evidence to support the sole aggravating circumstance of murder for remuneration. Appellant claimed that the murder was only a method to steal the money from the owner's car. The flaw in his argument was that no murder was necessary for him and the perpetrator to steal the money from the car. The appellate court's mandatory sentence review revealed that the death penalty was not imposed because of any arbitrary factor, passion, or prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the District Court of Pushmataha County (Oklahoma) found defendant guilty of aggravated manufacture of a controlled dangerous substance (methamphetamine) under Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-401(G)(3)(h) (2004), and unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance (methamphetamine) under Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-402(B)(1) (2004). His 20 year sentence and two year sentence, respectively, were to be served concurrently. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four officers arrived at defendant's home to execute a warrant. The first officer testified that he knocked on the door, identified the group as the police, and announced that they had a warrant to search the property. After waiting approximately 20 seconds with no response, a second officer busted open the front door with a sledge hammer, and three officers entered defendant's home. Defendant alleged that the search of his home violated the Fourth Amendment's knock-and-announce requirement. However, even if the execution of the warrant at defendant's home violated the Fourth Amendment's knock-and-announce requirement, the evidence obtained did not need to be suppressed. In addition, Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-401(G)(3)(h) (2004) was not unconstitutionally vague, and it was appropriately applied to the entire contents of the liquid mixture containing methamphetamine found in defendant's home. Finally, defendant's convictions for both aggravated manufacture and unlawful possession, based entirely on the methamphetamine contained within the liquid in a single glass jar, violated Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 11 (2001). Thus, his conviction for possession of methamphetamine was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of criminal appeals affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for aggravated manufacture of a controlled dangerous substance (methamphetamine). However, the court of criminal appeals reversed and dismissed his conviction for unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance (methamphetamine).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;BIGLER JOBE STOUFFER, Appellant, was tried by jury for the crimes of Murder in the First Degree and Shooting with Intent to Kill in Case No. CF-85-509 in the District Court of Oklahoma County before the Honorable Jerry Bass, District Judge. Appellant was sentenced to death, and life respectively and he perfected this appeal. Judgment and Sentence is AFFIRMED.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a new trial, a jury in the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), found appellant guilty of first-degree murder in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.7(A), and shooting with the intent to kill in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 642 (1981). Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of shooting with the intent to kill and to death for the crime of first-degree murder. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although appellant raised 18 issues on appeal, the court found no basis to overturn either his convictions or sentences. As to his convictions, there was no reason to credit appellant's argument regarding the improper admission of hearsay evidence against him or his claim that the admission of certain expert testimony violated his rights to a fair trial and sentencing. And, while evidence that appellant had a physical fight with his girlfriend's former boyfriend, admitted under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2404(B) (2001), was, in fact, inadmissible character evidence, Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2403 (2005), the improper introduction of the evidence was harmless. At sentencing, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding of the &quot;great risk of death to more than one person&quot; and the &quot;murder committed for the purpose of avoiding or prevent a lawful arrest or prosecution&quot; aggravating circumstances because appellant shot his two victims with the same weapon, at the same place, and at essentially the same time, and the jury could have believed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant killed his second victim so that there would be no witnesses to the shooting of the first victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was before the court on a certified question from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma regarding petitioner prisoner's application for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was serving a six-year sentence for the revocation of probation. He was then sentenced to two concurrent twenty-year sentences, which were ordered to run consecutive to the six-year sentence. The Oklahoma Department of Corrections audited the prisoner's case and made a correction to his rebill date after the six-year sentence had expired. The prisoner filed a petition for habeas corpus relief citing a violation of double jeopardy principals. A certified question was then submitted to the court. In answering the question, the court determined that the prisoner's rights under U.S. Const. amend. V and Okla. Const. art. II, &sect;&nbsp;21 had not been violated. The Oklahoma Legislature granted the Oklahoma Department of Corrections (DOC) the authority to carry out terms of imprisonment, and the only expectation a prisoner had was he was not required to serve more time than the sentence imposed. Due to the ongoing accumulation and/or reduction of credits throughout incarceration, there was no expectation of finality or that the sentence would have been discharged earlier. Any errors in DOC recordkeeping were not grounds for early release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified question was answered; the prisoner had no expectation of finality in his sentence such that a correction could not have been made.</SPAN></P>

The opinion testimony of an emergency room physician and physician's assistant specializing in child abuse assisted the jury in understanding the cause of the injuries found on the victim and her sibling. Defendant's due process rights were not violated by not allowing testimony that the victim's mother offered to give the victim up for adoption. Further, the instructions fully informed the jury as to the use and weight of expert opinion testimony. Also, there was sufficient evidence of penetration, under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1111(A), given the expert testimony regarding the victim's injuries although there was no semen found.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for beating the victim to death with a claw hammer after he refused to lend defendant money to purchase more cocaine. Defendant robbed the victim of $ 525 and subsequently robbed five convenience stores to get money for cocaine. On appeal, the court held that the admission of defendant's confession and the physical evidence derived therefrom did not violate his constitutional rights because he failed to show that his Miranda rights waiver was not knowingly and voluntarily made. Defendant was read his Miranda rights, and he waived them when he was arrested for the robberies, and he volunteered statements about the homicide and initiated that discussion. During a videotape of the interrogation, defendant was not threatened, coerced, or promised anything, and the fact that defendant was fatigued and hungry from drug usage did not render his waiver involuntary. However, defendant's Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated when the trial court excluded the videotaped examination of defendant's mother from evidence during sentencing, and therefore, his death sentence was reversed. The jury was also improperly instructed to disregard relevant mitigating evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed, but his death sentence was reversed, and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed, holding that &sect; 1031(D) did not violate the Establishment Clause as it had a secular legislative purpose, namely, to deter prostitution-related activities in areas where the public could be reasonably be expected to gather. The intent of &sect; 1031(D) was to protect potentially vulnerable populations from exposure to prostitution-related activities was further evidenced by the fact that it applied equally to such activities that occurred within 1,000 feet of a school. The principal or primary effect of &sect; 1031(D) was not the advancement of religion, but rather the deterring of prostitution, particularly in locations where vulnerable populations could reasonably be expected to gather. This provision did not advance religion generally or any specific faith in particular.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma, convicted defendant of trafficking illegal drugs (methamphetamine), in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 415B (Supp. 2004), failure to obtain drug tax stamp, in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 450 (2001), and unlawful possession of marijuana (misdemeanor), in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-402(B)(2) (Supp. 2004). Defendant was sentenced accordingly. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 30 prohibited the issuance of a warrant based upon future contingent events, making the house warrant illegal, and the fruits of its execution inadmissible at trial. The appellate court found that nothing in the provision required a showing that the evidence had to be in the place to be searched at the time the warrant issued. Nothing prohibited the issuance of an anticipatory search warrant, and it did not run afoul of Oklahoma's constitution. Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1222 required that the object of the search be currently in the possession of the person or at the location to be searched. The anticipatory search warrant issued was invalid and impermissible on statutory grounds and did not set forth probable cause for the warrant to issue. The appellate court would not apply the good-faith exception to save the admission of evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant which was not supported by probable cause. Because the evidence of drug trafficking, possession of marijuana, and failure to affix tax stamp was obtained pursuant to a statutorily invalid warrant, the trial court should have granted the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Grady County, Oklahoma, convicted defendant of first degree murder in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.7(C) (1991). Defendant was sentenced to death, and his applications for post-conviction relief and habeas corpus relief were denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The appellate court determined that defendant failed to show that the protocol was facially unconstitutional. Defendant did not suggest that the protocol was anything but humane and effective. Oklahoma and at least thirty-three other capital punishment states mandated lethal injection as the primary means of execution, suggesting that it comported with contemporary standards of decency. The appellate court in the past held that lethal injection per se was not unconstitutional. Oklahoma's execution protocol was constitutional on its face. The protocol provided that a physician was present, monitoring the execution, and thus each step of the process (including insertion of IV tubes and administration of the fluids) had to be performed to the physician's satisfaction. The appellate court would not speculate on whether mistakes may have been made in past executions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) that, on resentencing, sentenced him to death for murder based on the jury's finding of 2 aggravating circumstances, that the murder was especially heinous or cruel, and was committed for the purpose of avoiding lawful arrest or prosecution under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.12(4) and (5) (1991); and sentenced him to imprisonment for armed robbery and car theft.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was also convicted in his original trial of sodomy and rape, but those convictions were vacated and the State chose not to reprosecute him for those crimes. On retrial, the jury again imposed the death penalty. On appeal, defendant raised numerous claims of error. The court held that the trial court erred in allowing the State to argue &quot;rape&quot; as the predicate crime for the avoid-arrest aggravator because the State's evidence was inadequate to support a rape conviction where there was no evidence of penetration. The court reversed the death penalty sentence based on its finding of cumulative error, which included the trial court's unwillingness to provide defendant any opportunity to voir dire jurors who expressed reservations about the death penalty or to rehabilitate jurors who expressed an unwillingness to consider life sentences. The court found that the trial court also erred in its admission of numerous photographs of the victim and a crime scene video, in excluding mitigating evidence, and in admitting victim impact testimony in addition to that of a family representative. The court found evidence of serious prosecutorial misconduct and significant trial court bias.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court finding of the avoid-arrest aggravator and reversed defendant's death sentence based on cumulative error. The court remanded the case with directions that it be reassigned to a new judge for resentencing because of the substantial evidence of trial court bias contained in the record. The court noted that the State was not precluded from re-pursuing the avoid-arrest aggravator in any future resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant admitted he stabbed the victim multiple times and the evidence showed that defendant began his knifing of the victim near the kitchen, following her into the living room where he cut her throat, severing the carotid arteries on the left side of her neck. Defendant was not prejudiced by three references that were made to his previous trial because the jury was well aware that prior proceedings had taken place, as some of the testimony was presented by reading a transcript from defendant's prior trial. Any error was mitigated by the trial court's instructions. The admission of several photographs did not violate defendant's due process rights because they assisted the jury in understanding the crime scene.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by admitting into evidence photographs of duct tape and cigarette lighter fluid found at his residence because the facts alleged in the search warrant affidavit set forth probable cause to show that the items were at that location. After listing the crimes and defendant's participation, the affiant stated that, the day after the crimes, he saw items that appeared to be stolen from the victims' residence through defendant's window. The court rejected defendant's claim that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to either grant a mistrial or remove for cause a juror who was inappropriately contacted by a member of the victims' family because defendant failed to preserve the claim by excusing the juror with a peremptory challenge and making a record of which remaining juror he would have excused. The court dismissed defendant's convictions for arson and robbery because it treated defendant's convictions as ones for felony murder, and dismissed the underlying felonies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the jury's finding of the 4 aggravating circumstances and claimed the trial court erred by improperly denying his challenge for cause against prospective jurors; by disallowing two defense witnesses because his lawyers missed a discovery deadline; in its jury instructions on the issue of mitigation; and by precluding him from presenting evidence pertaining to &quot;residual doubt&quot; as a mitigating circumstance. The court held that defendant's due process rights were violated by the trial court's improper denial of his challenges for cause and its imposition of the overly harsh discovery sanction under Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 2002(E) (Supp. 2002) where the missed discovery deadline was not willful.  The court found that the trial court refused to dismiss three jurors for cause, which resulted in prejudice when defendant was forced, over objection, to keep an unacceptable juror. One of the jurors was not qualified to serve under Okla.

Although appellate courts give great deference to jury findings of fact, the court was compelled to conclude that, given the evidence presented, the determination that the inmate was not mentally retarded was not supported by the evidence.

Defense counsel represented defendant's daughter in her plea proceedings. Defendant pointed out that counsel had an actual conflict because he could not effectively cross-examine the daughter about her plea agreement and her role in the burglaries yet still maintain client confidentiality. The inherent conflict resulted in prejudice to defendant. The trial court also erred in failing to instruct the jury on the elements of feloniously carrying a weapon. Whether or not defendant agreed to the instructions, it was plain error to fail to instruct on the elements of a crime.

The case had a long procedural history, and currently before the court was one of his applications for post-conviction relief. The court concluded that it had merit because of testimony from an Oklahoma City Police chemist. The chemist withheld evidence; most likely lost or intentionally destroyed important and potentially exculpable (or incriminating) evidence; provided flawed laboratory analysis and documentation of her work; testified in a manner that exceeded acceptable limits of forensic science; and altered lab reports and handwritten notes in an effort to prevent detection of misconduct. As a result of the chemist's actions, the inmate did not receive a fair trial and resentencing proceeding. The record more than adequately supported the findings of the Oklahoma City Police Departmental Review Board pertaining to the chemist, including dishonesty in communications with her supervisor; mishandling evidence; failing to follow proper peer review procedure; and engaging in flawed and improperly documented casework analysis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction, vacated his death sentenced and remanded the case to the district court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporations filed a civil suit in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma claiming that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect;&sect; 1289.7a and 1290.22(B) (Supp. 2004) were unconstitutional and sought injunctive relief. The federal district court certified a question of law to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor of Oklahoma had signed into law an act which amended the Oklahoma Firearms Act and the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act, and proscribed certain persons from prohibiting the transporting and storing of firearms in locked vehicles on certain property. The corporations had established and implemented policies prohibiting the possession of firearms anywhere on company property, including inside vehicles parked in company parking lots. The company's sought injunctive relief to avoid being prosecuted under the new act. The court of criminal appeals initially noted that the plain statutory language of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect;&sect; 1289.7 and 1290.22(B) prohibited enumerated entities from establishing particular policies affecting firearms; that was, the plain language forbade an act. The court of criminal appeals held that the statutory language did not itself impose a punishment for performance of the forbidden acts, so the general misdemeanor statute controlled, and the offense was punishable as a misdemeanor, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 21. The court of criminal appeals concluded that to find otherwise would have rendered Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 21 meaningless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of criminal appeals concluded that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1289.7a and Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1290.22(B) (Supp. 2004) were both criminal statutes, the violation of which could have subjected a violator to criminal misdemeanor sanctions or punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and sentenced to death. He filed two previous applications for state postconviction relief under Oklahoma's Post-Conviction Procedure Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1089 (2004), which were denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner claimed that DNA evidence, developments in the field of comparative bullet analysis, and evidence of brain fingerprinting demonstrated that he was factually innocent of murder.

Stat. tit. 22, ch. 18, &sect; 9.7(G) (2004). Nothing had changed since the court disposed of the prisoner's evidentiary challenges in its second postconviction opinion. The prisoner failed to show any error by counsel that deprived him of effective assistance: the DNA evidence was not dispositive of the prisoner's factual innocence because the evidence of his guilt was strong even without the DNA evidence, and he was not considered a candidate for DNA testing until after the brain fingerprinting tests had been done. The court rejected the prisoner's challenges to Rule 9.7(G) and the Post-Conviction Procedure Act because there were no actual innocence claims in his postconviction filings that had been barred from review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murdering a 13-year-old boy more than 10 years after the crime occurred. Defendant claimed that the delay deprived him of his due process rights. The court held: (1) while defendant claimed that some defense witnesses were dead or unavailable, the jury took into account the problems due to the passage of time, and so defendant's due process rights were not violated; (2) the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant in that defendant was seen with the boy going toward the lake where some of the body parts were found, and there were bite marks on defendant; and (3) a witness's description of defendant smelling like he had gutted a deer was not unduly prejudicial under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2403 (2001). The court reversed defendant's sentence, stating that defendant had a background that included severe abuse as a child and teenager and defendant's trial counsel did not present any of these potentially mitigating factors at trial, nor did his appellate counsel present evidence regarding his trial counsel's case in mitigation at the remanded evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on Count II and 50 years imprisonment on Count III. On appeal, the court affirmed, stating that defendant waived any claim of &quot;irregularities&quot; in the preliminary hearing proceedings by pleading guilty. Further, Oklahoma was not required to change its procedures and law so that aggravating circumstances should be included in an indictment or information and presented to a magistrate at the preliminary hearing. He also waived the right to a jury trial when he entered a plea of guilty and agreed to a non-jury trial on the issue of punishment. After reviewing the record and carefully weighing the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating evidence, along with the errors alleged in the appeal, the court found that the death sentence was factually substantiated and appropriate.

In affirming, the court found that defendant had not shown that his right to be present had been violated. He also had not received ineffective assistance of counsel. The police had probable cause to place defendant under arrest. Admission of evidence of homicide literature in defendant's home was relevant and not unfairly prejudicial given the manner in which the victims were killed. Details of defendant's criminal history were directly relevant to his credibility as a witness. Sufficient evidence supported the conviction because the jury was presented with an interconnected web of physical evidence, eyewitness testimony, and defendant's inconsistent statements. The death sentence was not the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor because the jury found aggravating circumstances: the nature of the double murder itself and defendant's admission to a past crime of violence. The victim impact evidence did not distract the jury from rendering punishment out of a reasoned, moral response to the crimes.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that defendant was competent and assessed the punishment at death. On capital mandatory sentence review, the court affirmed the judgment and sentence, stating that defendant was competent and had the capacity to understand the choice between life and death and to knowingly and intelligently waive any and all rights to appeal his sentence. The thorough competency examination by the physicians of the State hospital clearly indicated that he had the capacity to understand what he was doing and to knowingly and intelligently waive his appellate rights. Defendant was a long time prison resident who saw death as a better alternative to life without parole. The killing of his cellmate was a tool for his desire to die. Although it seemed that defendant was using the State to assist him in suicide, the death penalty was clearly indicated in the case, despite defendant's personal wishes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of LeFlore County (Oklahoma), which convicted him of two counts of first-degree felony murder (robbery with a dangerous weapon), in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.7(B) (Supp. 2000). In accordance with the jury's recommendation, the trial court sentenced defendant to death on both counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another man talked their way into the victims' rural home, stabbed them, and cut their throats, leaving them dead on the floor. The two men then stole some money and left in the victim's pickup truck. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion for change of venue after voir dire was completed. The trial court did not violate Witherspoon by striking one potential juror. Improper witness comments, victim impact testimony, and prosecutorial conduct were not unduly prejudicial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting photographs of the victims, which depicted the handiwork of defendant and his recruited cohort. The evidence was more than sufficient to establish the &quot;avoid arrest&quot; aggravator because defendant planned and accomplished the murders in order to avoid arrest and prosecution for robbing them. The court modified the uniform instruction on the &quot;heinous, atrocious, or cruel&quot; aggravating circumstance to more fully inform the jury regarding the findings that had to be made in order to properly apply the aggravator and to ensure that a jury determination was made regarding each of these findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences of death but remanded the case for correction of the judgment and sentence document to reflect the provision under which defendant was actually convicted.</SPAN></P>

The failure of the information to include every element of the underlying felony was harmless. The trial court properly conducted voir dire.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first-degree murder, among other charges. The District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, granted defendant's request for a separate jury trial on the issue of mental retardation prior to conducting defendant's trial for the murder charge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court found that the State was entitled to the relief requested as no prior case law required or authorized the trial court to empanel a separate jury trial on the issue of mental retardation before defendant was brought to trial on his murder charge. The appellate court also clarified how the issue of mental retardation could be resolved prior to trial by establishing a procedure for pretrial determination of mental retardation and for appeal. If the trial court denied the motion to quash bill of particulars on grounds of mental retardation, and if that decision was appealed and was affirmed on appeal, defendant's intellectual functioning could still be considered as a mitigating factor in the sentencing stage of the capital murder trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in an Oklahoma trial court of robbery with a firearm, after former conviction of two or more felonies, first degree malice aforethought murder, and conspiracy to commit robbery with a firearm, after former conviction of two or more felonies.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by allowing the State to read witnesses' testimony from his first trial at his resentencing without making a showing of unavailability. The court of appeals disagreed. The entire examination of both witnesses was read to the jury. The testimony had an adequate indicia of reliability as both witnesses had been thoroughly cross-examined by defense counsel. In addition, the testimony was taken under oath at the first trial and was transcribed by a licensed court reporter, thereby providing an adequate record. The cross-examination at the first trial was conducted by the same highly competent defense attorney who represented defendant at his resentencing trial. Defense counsel exposed the bias of both witnesses and challenged the accuracy of their perceptions and memories. In addition, their testimony was not the only evidence offered to show that defendant was the triggerman. The clerk's testimony corroborated the witnesses' testimony that defendant shot the victim as the victim approached him with a broom. Therefore, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to support the single aggravating circumstance found by the jury under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.12(2) (2001). The evidence showed that defendant shot the victim twice at close range inside a transmission shop, while his wife and another person stood a short distance away. However, the court vacated defendant's death sentence due to the trial court's instruction to the jurors in response to their question about where defendant might be assigned as a prisoner if he received a life sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a notice of intent to appeal and designation of record (notice and designation) in the District Court of Bryan County, Oklahoma. A petition in error was filed by defendant's counsel, Oklahoma Indigent Defense System (OIDS). Defendant sought to appeal a revocation order. OIDS counsel moved to dismiss the pending appellate proceeding, as defendant's trial counsel had not filed the required notice and designation within 10 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a regular direct appeal from a conviction, a defendant's time limitation for commencing an appeal began from the date of pronouncement of judgment and sentence. Appellate review of an order revoking a suspended sentence followed the same procedure as that for perfecting a regular misdemeanor or felony appeal. Provided, however, that in a revocation appeal, for the purpose of calculating the date that the appellate time period would commence, the date of the trial court's imposition of the order of revocation was substituted for the date of judgment and sentence. Consequently, in defendant's matter, his notice and designation were required to be filed within 10 days from the date the district court pronounced its decision to revoke. In defendant's case, it was not until Tuesday, May 20, 2003, that defendant filed with the trial court clerk his notice and designation. This filing occurred more than 10 calendar days after the Wednesday, May 7th, imposition of the order of revocation. Thus, unless something other than calendar days were counted in calculating the 10-day filing deadline, defendant's attempted appeal was not timely initiated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgments and sentences of death entered in the McIntosh County District Court, Oklahoma, on two counts of first degree murder with malice aforethought together with 100 years' imprisonment for robbery with a dangerous weapon, and, in a second case, 20 years' imprisonment for larceny of a motor vehicle. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had been granted probation, carried out with his wife a plan to rob and kill two weak and elderly persons who had recently employed them. On appeal defendant asserted inter alia that the district court should have instructed on the defense of &quot;voluntary intoxication&quot; based on defendant's testimony at the preliminary hearing that before the murder he and his wife had injected some methamphetamine. The court sustained the district court's refusal to give the intoxication instruction, noting that after committing the murder, defendant was able to drive 400 miles in the victim's car and six days later was able later to clearly describe the events surrounding the murder. Defendant also contended that a complete and adequate review of his case could not be conducted because there were several instances where the transcript of voir dire did not indicate the names of the prospective jurors who were being addressed or who were responding to questions from the judge or counsel. The court reviewed for plain error, holding that defendant had waived any objections to the nature and extent of voir dire not made before the commencement of testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the jury's determination that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating evidence and that the sentence of death was factually substantiated and appropriate and not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and, finding no error warranting reversal or modification, affirmed the judgments and sentences entered in the district court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an inmate, was charged with the first degree murder. The State alleged three aggravating circumstances: (1) defendant was previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person; (2) the murder was committed by a person while serving a sentence of imprisonment on conviction of a felony; and (3) the probability that defendant would present a continuing threat to society. The jury found the existence of the three aggravating circumstances and set punishment at death. The appellate court granted review, but found no error warranting reversal. Use of an armed guard to escort defendant to and from the courtroom did not violate Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 15. There was no error in use of evidence of defendant's prior robbery convictions to support aggravating circumstances. Trial counsel's conduct was within the wide range of professionally competent assistance.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the application. The court was not entitled to consider the merits of a subsequent application for such relief, unless the application contained sufficient specific facts establishing that the current issues had not and could not have been previously presented. Petitioner argued that state jurors should have been instructed that aggravating circumstances had to outweigh mitigating evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that petitioner misconstrued the state death penalty statutes. The substantive element of capital murder was the jury's finding of an aggravated circumstance necessary to support a capital sentence. This finding authorized jurors to consider imposing the death penalty, not the weighing of all circumstances, as contended by petitioner. The only thing that case law required was that the jurors make the factual finding of an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, and, once this was found, the substantive elements of the capital crime were satisfied.</SPAN></P>

The instant court concluded that defendant was not denied a fair sentencing hearing by the trial judge's decision to preclude defendant from presenting mitigating evidence to the jury at his non-capital sentencing proceeding. A criminal trial was not to be based upon so-called &quot;character&quot; evidence, and the same principle applied to sentencing proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court found that, although defendant's post-conviction affidavits established more &quot;mitigating&quot; evidence than was developed at trial, they did not provide a reasonable probability the sentencing result would have been different if competent counsel had presented the materials and explained their significance. Defendant asserted that his jury trial rights were violated by the district court's failure to instruct the jury that it must find the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. The court disagreed, holding that Apprendi did not invalidate the State's capital sentencing scheme. Defendant also asserted that, due to his mild mental retardation, his execution would violate the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and offend contemporary standards of decency. The court found that defendant's mental retardation claims had merit in view of the substantive Eighth Amendment limitation imposed under Atkins on the state's power to take the life of a mentally retarded offender.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court concluded he was not deprived of his right to present mitigating evidence by admission of edited videotape, as the excised portion added nothing to the evidence that was not apparent. He claimed a litany of evidence was improperly admitted at his resentencing trial. In doing so, he uniformly argued that the admitted evidence complained of was irrelevant to resentencing issues, and not that it was improperly admitted at trial. The admission of evidence at resentencing was limited to evidence bearing directly on punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was arrested for the misdemeanor offense of engaging/offering to engage in an act of prostitution. The District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) set her bail at the nondiscretionary amount of $ 15,000 pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1101.1 (supp. 2002). Petitioner's request for a reduction of bail was denied by respondent special trial court judge. Petitioner then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner alleged that Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1101.1 (supp. 2002), was unconstitutional because it deprived those in custody of the opportunity for an individualized determination to bail, violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, and was being used as punishment and not merely to ensure the presence of an accused at future proceedings. The special judge averred the legislature recognized that in crimes involving prostitution, minimum bail amounts and/or personal recognizance bonds did not serve to protect the interests of society or the neighborhoods plagued by this unlawful activity. The judge concluded Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1101.1 (supp. 2002), was the legislature's attempt to reduce the futility and hopelessness felt by citizens outraged such conduct was continuing in their neighborhoods. The appellate court found that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated the due process rights of Oklahoma citizens to an individualized determination to bail guaranteed by Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 7. The appellate court noted that the amount of an appearance bond should never be set at a high amount solely for the purpose of punishing an accused.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner demonstrated that her confinement was unlawful. The matter was remanded to the trial court for a proper bail determination.</SPAN></P>

The State filed an application to terminate defendant from drug court for violations of the terms of his drug court agreement. The District Court of Hughes County (Oklahoma) terminated defendant from drug court and imposed sentences. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged numerous errors, including a denial of due process because the district court was part of his drug court team. The appellate court conducted a review of the drug court program under the Oklahoma Drug Court Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect;&sect; 471 to -471.11 et seq. (Supp. 1998). The appellate court held there was more than sufficient independent, corroborative evidence presented at the termination hearing to find defendant had violated the terms of his drug court contract. Defendant claimed that the proceedings were inherently biased because they were conducted by the district judge, a member of the drug court team. The appellate court held defendant's allegations of bias did not constitute error sufficient to require reversal. There was no indication that defendant was deprived of a fair proceeding. Moreover, defendant never requested the judge's recusal which waived the issue. However, the appellate court concluded that in the future, if an application to terminate a drug court participant was filed, and a defendant objected to the drug court team judge hearing the matter by filing a motion to recuse, the defendant's application for recusal should be granted.</SPAN></P>

There was evidence defendant discussed killing the victim before the crime, the crime was particularly brutal, and there was evidence defendant intended to kill the victim's relatives, and took steps in that regard. Defendant presented mitigating evidence that he had no significant prior criminal history, his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct was impaired by alcohol, that he was under the influence of an emotional disturbance by virtue of his alcohol dependence, and he cooperated with authorities. After carefully weighing the aggravating circumstance and the mitigating evidence, along with the errors alleged in the appeal, the supreme court found that the sentence of death was factually substantiated and appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with one count of owning or operating a chop shop and five counts of knowingly concealing stolen property. The District Court of Delaware County (Oklahoma) ruled that Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 4209.8 (Supp. 1998) was unconstitutional, suppressed the evidence discovered during an inspection, as well as evidence recovered pursuant to a follow-up search warrant, and granted defendant's motion to quash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers went to defendant's business to conduct an administrative inspection. The visit was prompted by discrepancies on some title applications that defendant submitted to the tax commission. Defendant informed officers that he was buying boat motors from out of state and that the paperwork he was getting with the motors was off one or two numbers, so he was changing the paperwork to match the serial numbers on the motors and then sending the paperwork in with the title applications. The officers went to another building where there were about 200 outboard motors and two or three boats. A check of a serial number indicated one of the boats was stolen. At this point the administrative inspection was ceased, and a search warrant was obtained. The court ruled as follows: (1) as defendant's business was searched at a reasonable time, during business hours, he did not have standing to argue that the statute should be held facially void because other persons could conceivably be searched at an unreasonable time; and (2) the statute was limited to business hours and complied with the 4th Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit submitted a question for certification, requesting clarification on the interpretation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 652(B) (Supp. 1992), prohibiting the use of a vehicle to facilitate the discharge of a firearm (drive-by shootings).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court previously held that, where a vehicle was used to facilitate the intentional discharge of a weapon during a single transaction or shooting event, only one count of using a vehicle to facilitate the intentional discharge of a firearm was appropriate. The certified question asked whether the statute had the same meaning under Oklahoma law on May 2, 1997, the day defendant's criminal conviction for two counts of violating the statute was affirmed? The question turned on the intent of the legislature, whether the statute criminalized a course of action, rather than a discrete act. The court determined that the statute's meaning was the same as it was on May 2, 1997. The court ruled that the legislature intended to impose an additional punishment on persons who committed drive-by shootings by allowing more than one prosecution when there were multiple victims. Furthermore, the court ruled that its prior case was wrongly decided and must be overruled.</SPAN></P>

Upon completion of these crimes, the victim was executed on the roadside. All the elements of felony murder in the commission of rape or kidnapping were satisfied. The only question for the jury was who committed the crimes. Defendant was one of the rapists, and he may or may not have actually pulled the trigger; if he did not, he may nevertheless have encouraged it. The court ruled that a rational jury could have convicted defendant of malice aforethought murder. Furthermore, any error in allowing a witness to be questioned after he attempted to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, because it did not contribute to the jury's verdict. The evidence established that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and that the jury was not influenced by passion, prejudice or any arbitrary factors.</SPAN></P>

The indictment was dismissed and refiled as an information in the District Court of Comanche County, Oklahoma, charging defendant with caretaker neglect (count one), obstructing an officer (count two), and attempted subornation of perjury (count three).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the director of a nursing home. The caretaker neglect charge arose from the care or lack thereof that a 91-year-old resident of the home received prior to his death. The charge of obstructing an officer arose from circumstances where an investigator from the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Attorney General's Office was refused access to photographs of a resident, as well as the resident's medical records and the depicted resident. The State was unsuccessful in convicting defendant. On appeal, the State alleged that the district court erred in ruling that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 843.1 (1991) was unconstitutional. The court of criminal appeals held that &sect; 843.1 was not unconstitutional since it was not so vague as to be violative of due process; it was never repealed; and it gave defendant adequate notice. Also, it was not unconstitutional because caretaker was defined differently in rules and regulations governing nursing homes, and because it lent itself to selective prosecution. Further, the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit was entitled to a non-Medicaid patient's confidential records under the circumstances of this case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, appellant argued that: (1) the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury; (2) the trial court erred in excluding evidence of the deceased's father's extensive and violent criminal history; (3) the trial court erred in failing to admonish the jury not to consider the matter of parole; and (4) his sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was excessive and cruel and unusual under the circumstances. Upon review, the appellate court affirmed the judgment. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting appellant's requested jury instructions. Evidence of the specific nature of the deceased's father's violent history was collateral to the issue of appellant's guilt or innocence and not relevant as it did not have any tendency to make more or less probable the fact that appellant intended to kill the deceased. The trial court's refusal to admonish the jury not to consider matters outside the jury instructions was not prejudicial, as it would have been merely repetitive of the written instructions. Appellant's sentence was properly based in the evidence and supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the appellant raised 20 propositions of error, including that the trial court erred in excusing a prospective juror for cause because of her views on capital punishment without ascertaining whether or not the prospective juror could follow the law despite her views. The court found no abuse of discretion by the trial court in the manner in which it conducted voir dire. The trial court's questions to the prospective juror sufficiently established that she could neither consider nor impose the death penalty in the appellant's case, where the evidence and law warranted its imposition. The trial court's questions were adequate to determine whether the prospective juror could sit as a fair and impartial juror in the case. Appellant also made several allegations that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court found that trial counsel made certain omissions and errors, but that these errors were not outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance. The court held that the appellant failed to rebut the presumption that counsel's conduct was professionally reasonable and failed to show that he was denied a fundamentally fair trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree and assault and battery with a deadly weapon. Defendant was sentenced to death on the murder conviction and 15 years imprisonment for assault and battery with a deadly weapon.

He claimed these restrictions included being denied juror questionnaires, inquiry into the jurors' states of mind regarding defendant's defense and a meaningful question and answer process. The court found that there was no evidence to support defendant's contention that he was not provided with the jury questionnaires. Moreover, no abuse of discretion would be found so long as the voir dire questioning was broad enough to afford the defendant a jury free of outside influence, bias or personal interest. With regard to the sufficiency of the evidence, the court found that the direct and circumstantial evidence presented at trial was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to conclude defendant intended to kill victim when he stabbed him 11 times, his statements notwithstanding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, convicted defendant of five counts of murder in the first degree in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.7 (1991). The jury then sentenced defendant to death on each count. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised several issues of error. The appellate court denied relief, holding, inter alia, defendant did not show: (1) he was denied a jury composed of a fair cross-section of the community caused by systematic exclusion of African-Americans; (2) his story raised a credible, reasonable hypothesis of innocence as the case was built on strong circumstantial evidence; (3) a discovery violation, or the admission of other crimes and hearsay evidence, resulted in a miscarriage of justice or substantially violated his statutory or constitutional rights; (4) the Allen instruction given was improper, or that the jury misunderstood the law; (5) trial counsel was ineffective; or (6) the admission of victim impact evidence was erroneous. Although the prosecution presented misleading evidence in the first stage of trial and engaged in egregiously improper argument in both stages, the jury was not misled. Thus, the prosecutorial misconduct did not affect defendant's rights. Finally, the combination of errors did not infect the trial or sentencing proceeding with unfairness, and the death sentence was factually substantiated and appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding no error warranting modification, the court affirmed the judgment and death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found by the jury to have had sexual intercourse with and then to have killed the female victim. Appellant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. Evidence against appellant included a DNA match between appellant and sperm found in victim, a prior crime of a sexual assault upon and threat to kill a female, that victim was an acquaintance of appellant, and a fellow prisoner's testimony that appellant had admitted killing the victim. The trial court conducted an in camera reliability hearing prior to admission of the fellow prisoner's testimony. The court referred to the greater latitude for admissibility of like occurrences evidence in sexual assault cases. The admitted photographs were relevant and not unduly gruesome. The aggravating factors found, and reweighed against mitigating factors by the court, included that the murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel, appellant had committed a prior felony, appellant was a continuing threat to society, and the murder was committed to avoid arrest. The court affirmed appellant's conviction and death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence were affirmed. Whether to disqualify a juror for cause rested within trial court's sound discretion. Evidence that appellant previously sexually assaulted and threatened to kill a woman was admissible to show appellant's motive and intent to kill the victim in this case. There was proof appellant killed to avoid arrest. Certain victim photographs were properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent struck the jury panel in a criminal case involving a black defendant, contending that the fact that there was one black prospective juror in the panel did not fairly represent the defendant's peers and was fundamentally unfair. The State sought the reversal of respondent's order. After determining that a writ of mandamus and/or prohibition was the proper vehicle for the State to use, the court granted the petition and reversed the striking of the jury panel. The court held that respondent erred by striking the jury panel because there was no evidence presented that the current method of jury selection in the county systematically excluded distinctive groups within the community. The record was devoid of any evidence that the jury panel was not drawn from a fair cross section of the community; therefore there was no legal justification for respondent to strike the jury panel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his first degree murder and first degree robbery convictions and death sentence, after a finding of the aggravating factors that murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing lawful arrest or prosecution and that there existed a probability that appellant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society, by the District Court of Sequoya County (Oklahoma).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant told his wife that they needed money and he was going to do whatever it took to get it. The couple found the victim, who was killed. Later appellant's then-estranged wife implicated him. Appellant was convicted of murder and robbery and sentenced to death. The court affirmed. A voir dire record omission did not affect review of Witherspoon issues. Jurors who said they could vote for the death penalty did not unequivocally say that was the only option they would consider. Although several items not listed in a search warrant were seized, only one was admitted into evidence at trial. That item had been in plain view after a drawer was opened looking for a warrant-specified wallet. Appellant had not objected to the jury going into the hall unattended after deliberations began. Due to third-party testimony that appellant admitted he had killed the victim, the confidential nature of his prior discussions with his wife was lost and her testimony was corroborated. There was robbery even though the victim had been killed first. Appellant's not disguising himself showed the aggravating factor of killing to avoid arrest. A very short victim impact statement had no plain error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convictions and sentence affirmed. Due to third-party testimony that appellant admitted to the killing, the confidentiality of his prior talk with his now-estranged wife was lost and her testimony was corroborated. There was robbery even though the victim may not have known what was happening and had been killed first. Appellant's lack of disguise showed the killing had been to avoid arrest. Gloves in a drawer had been in &quot;plain view.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, tried by jury in Tulsa County District Court (Oklahoma), was convicted of first degree murder, shooting with intent to kill, and robbery with firearms. He was sentenced to death, life imprisonment, and 20 years in accordance with the jury's recommendation. He appealed, asserting errors at trial and constitutional violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, shooting with intent to kill, and robbery with firearms. Defendant's trial and sentencing were not made unfair by the denial of individual voir dire and the possibility prospective jurors had lied to be excused. Defendant's ex post facto and equal protection challenges to the death penalty statute had been rejected previously. Separating elements of murder between instructions was not prejudicial. The record showed defendant committed murder during robbery. Pre-trial information was sufficient. Defendant's robbery conviction should have been dismissed as a lesser-included offense. Ex post facto prohibitions were violated when defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment for shooting to kill, since the maximum imprisonment at the time had been 20 years. Inadmissible parts of surviving victim's testimony did not deny defendant a substantial right. Testimony from murdered victim's family fairly encompassed the murder's effects. Defense counsel was not ineffective; any deficiencies were not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction and sentence for first-degree murder were affirmed. Conviction for robbery with a firearm reversed with instructions to dismiss as an offense whose elements were included in first-degree murder. Conviction for shooting with intent to kill affirmed, but sentence reduced to maximum possible at the time of the offense.</SPAN></P>

The other participant shot and killed a clerk and wounded two other persons. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder.

Defendant did not carry burden to establish incompetency. Jurors were properly excused. Prosecutor's cross-examination and closing comments were permissible. Intoxication defense applied to specific intent crimes, not felony-murder general intent crime; and mental retardation was not a defense to death sentence. Defendant was not entitled to instructions including threshold requirements defining the least culpable mental state for the death penalty, because U.S. Const. amend. VIII did not require jury to make those findings. The record supported the requisite findings and were made in an adequate proceeding before an appropriate tribunal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant filed an appeal from a judgment of the Pittsburg County District Court (Oklahoma), in which a jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree and three counts of shooting with intent to kill and recommended the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of murder and sentenced to death, appealed, challenging jury selection, jury instructions, claiming insufficient evidence, and ineffective counsel. The court affirmed. The record did not support appellant's claim that jury selection violated the Equal Protection Clause. Since appellant gave a detailed account of the events and his conduct, he failed to show he was sufficiently intoxicated to raise a reasonable doubt of his ability to form specific intent, thus he was not entitled to a manslaughter instruction. The evidence showing appellant killed one person and shot three others was sufficient to support the aggravating finding that appellant knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person. Finally, defense counsel's strategy to eliminate malice aforethought by arguing appellant was on drugs, did not know the deceased, and shot him as a reflex, was a sound and valid trial strategy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Imposition of the death penalty was proper because evidence that appellant killed one person and shot three others supported the aggravating finding that he knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person, and the murder was committed to avoid or prevent a lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced in June 2005, and had one child. The parties continued to live together off and on after the decree was entered, and after reconciliation failed in September 2007, apparently continued to work with the parenting coordinator after the coordinator's appointment expired. The parenting coordinator was reappointed, and in July 2008, filed a report recommending that the father be given legal custody of the child. The father's motion to adopt the parenting coordinator's July 2008 report was granted, and the father's motion to modify the decree was granted. The district court awarded sole custody of the child to the father and on its own motion, discharged the parenting coordinator. The appellate court ruled that the district court had jurisdiction to reappoint the parenting coordinator in the case. However, the Parenting Coordinator Act did not authorize the parenting coordinator to change the custody order or make recommendations regarding to whom custody of a minor child should be awarded. The appellate court found that the father failed to meet his burden of proof showing that a change in custody was warranted.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of Payne County, Oklahoma, denied the prisoner's motion for summary judgment and granted defendants' motion to dismiss. The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Okla. Stat. tit. 57, &sect; 566.4(K) (Supp. 2006) set forth a procedure for correction officials to review the subject matter of a prisoner's claims in order to provide the court with additional information for the processing of the claim. The prisoner contended that &sect; 566.4(K) was a special law prohibited by Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 46, because it affected only inmates rather than all Oklahoma citizens who filed tort claims. On appeal, the court deemed &sect; 566.4's classification of persons sharing the same circumstances to be reasonable and justified. The special report provision of &sect; 566.4(K) was not unconstitutional. The court next found that the trial court correctly dismissed the prisoner's substantive claims. In addition, as an inmate sentenced to life imprisonment, the prisoner did not qualify for earned credits under Okla. Stat. tit. 57, &sect; 138(A) (Supp. 2009) so the disciplinary ruling cost him none, and he had no protected liberty interest in his security classification. The court specifically rejected the prisoner's claims that the trial court wrongfully conducted an evidentiary hearing. The record plainly reflected that no evidentiary hearing was conducted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the owner had not shown the trial court abused its discretion in finding the property was dilapidated under Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 22-112 (2004) and had become detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of the general public and the community. The testimony at trial demonstrated by competent evidence significant repair delay and ten dilapidation hearings. The property was in a significant state of decay and partial ruin to the extent that bricks were continuing to fall from time to time, the mortar was brittle and quickly degrading, the patio cover had not been replaced, and the stucco covering was falling off. Section 22-112 was a constitutionally permissible police power statute enacted to protect the general public's health, safety, and welfare. It was rationally related to that goal, satisfied the rational basis test, was clear and unambiguous in its purpose, and thus did not constitute an unconstitutional taking. The police power process exercised by the city and as applied to the owner satisfied constitutional due process. The trial court's findings were not clearly against the weight of the evidence, contrary to law or established principles of equity.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the employee's age discrimination action, holding that she failed to state a legally cognizable Burk tort claim because she had access to the same remedies as other victims of alleged violations of the State Government Reduction-In-Force and Severance Benefits Act and State employment discrimination. On appeal, the court disagreed and reversed. The court held that the employee was an at-will employee because she did not agree to a contract or otherwise obligate herself to work for a certain period of time, and the district attorney's office did not obligate itself to employ her for a definite duration. The court further held that state employees who alleged age discrimination were part of a larger, single class composed of all victims of employment discrimination, and because the remedies for the different forms of discrimination were disparate, there was a Burk tort remedy for those who alleged employment age discrimination, including the employee.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 3(13)(d) (2001 and Supp 2005), was unconstitutionally vague in failing to set forth what injuries received during recreational or social activities are to be deemed non-compensable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant worked for respondent, a temporary agency, that assigned him to work for an employer in its warehouse. The warehouse contained a small basketball court that workers were permitted to use after work and on breaks. During a lunch break, the claimant was playing basketball when he injured his knee. He applied for compensation, but his claim was denied based upon a determination that the injury was sustained in the course of a recreational activity and did not arise out of the claimant's employment under Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 3(13)(a) and (d) (2001 and Supp 2005). On review, the court held that, because the challenged order did not address the issue of subsection (d)'s constitutionality, there was no decision on that issue to review. The state legislature's prerogative to exclude from compensability any injury to a worker incurred during work-related recreational and social activities was not an unconstitutional exercise of its power to legislate.</SPAN></P>

In the land dispute case regarding a tax deed, the Secretary had filed a motion for summary judgment for the protection of the interests of Indian defendants owning restricted land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the Secretary's motion for summary judgment on the basis that the tax deed in the underlying action was void because the provisions of &sect; 6(e) of the Act of August 4, 1947, required notice to be served on the Bureau of Indian Affairs prior to the sale of restricted property for delinquent taxes. The landowners argued that the law should not have applied because county treasurers and lawyers were generally ignorant of the statute and because there were no state appellate cases and only one Oklahoma federal district court case construing it. The court upheld the decision because just as everyone was charged with knowledge of the United States Statutes at Large, once a statute had been published, all citizens were on notice of its contents as a matter of law. The landowners also argued that the trial court abused its discretion in its determination that they had not met their burden of proof to establish title by adverse possession. However, neither the payment of taxes nor the recording of a deed constituted possession. Thus, the payment of taxes and the recording of a deed without more did not establish prescriptive title.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 22-115.1 restricted the location of dog kennels near schools or licensed day care facilities; the owner operated a kennel within 2500 feet of a school and day care facility. The trial court determined the statute was unconstitutional as applied to the owner. The owner lacked standing to challenge the statute's constitutionality because, at the time of its enactment, the owner did not have a license to operate the kennel, even though he had obtained zoning variances, and thus had no vested right to continue operating his kennel without a license. A prior order granting zoning variances did not create a vested right in a kennel license as the owner had not completed all the steps necessary to obtain a license; the owner still had to comply with the building code by providing a handicapped restroom on the premises. Because the owner lacked standing, the court did not reach the issue of whether the statute violated Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 52.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the representative of the school had a right to seek injunctive relief. Defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 22-115.1, because he had no vested right that entitled him to constitutional protection for the unlawful operation of his unlicensed kennel. A previous order concerning a zoning ordinance did not create a vested right in defendant to operate his kennel without a license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a lessee of minerals, sought a judgment declaring its right to use an abandoned wellbore located on appellant landowners' surface estate. Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court of Logan County (Oklahoma) granted the lessee's motion for summary judgment and denied the landowners' motion for summary judgment. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the 1980s, a prior lessee abandoned and plugged the wellbore at issue with cement, leaving the casing in place. The landowners acquired the surface estate in 1989. The lessee obtained valid leases of the minerals underlying the landowners' surface estate and obtained a permit to re-enter the plugged well from the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. On appeal, the court concluded that the trial court erred in denying the landowners' motion for summary judgment on their claim to compensation for use of the casing and wellbore. First, the casing of the well clearly became a part of the surface estate upon the prior lessee's failure to remove it within a reasonable time. The landowners also owned the plugged and abandoned wellbore. Second, the landowners did not suffer any unconstitutional taking of their property as a result of the lessee's mineral operations. Third, the landowners' right to compensation for use of the abandoned wellbore should be determined under the Oklahoma Surface Damages Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 52, &sect;&sect; 318.2 to 318.9 (Supp. 1982), but the landowners' right to compensation for use of the casing should be measured by the rental value of the casing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the trial court's order denying the landowners' motion for summary judgment on the issue of the landowners' claim to compensation for use of the casing and wellbore. The court affirmed the trial court's order in all other respects. The court remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee had soft tissue injuries and no surgery or surgery recommendation. The employer asserted that the trial court erred by awarding the employee 14 weeks and one day of TTD and by denying the employer's request for credit for overpayment of TTD because the employee was only entitled to eight weeks of TTD. The court agreed and vacated the TTD award and the denial of overpayment of TTD because the employee was only entitled to eight weeks of TTD pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 22(3)(d) (Supp. 2007). Because surgery was neither recommended nor performed, &sect; 22(3)(d) limited the employee's TTD for soft tissue injury to eight weeks. The employee argued that &sect; 22(3)(d) constituted &quot;special legislation&quot; because it classified part of this homogeneous group as non-surgical and thereby denied that class the right to claim TTD benefits beyond eight weeks. The court disagreed that this statute constituted &quot;special legislation.&quot; Although &sect; 22(3)(d) separated for different treatment under the statutory benefit scheme part of the entire class of employees with soft tissue injuries, employees with soft tissue injuries did not constitute a class &quot;of similarly affected persons.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant employee, a member of the Cherokee Nation, was injured during the course of his employment with a casino owned by respondent Cherokee Nation Enterprises (employer), and sought workers' compensation benefits. Respondent Oklahoma Workers' Compensation Court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and a three-judge panel of that court affirmed. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee asserted that barring him from the Oklahoma workers' compensation courts violated his constitutional rights to equal protection and due process of law because the provisions of Oklahoma's Workers' Compensation Act were more favorable to workers than the provisions of the Cherokee Nation's Workers' Compensation Act.  The court held that the employee's argument misunderstood the nature of sovereign immunity and its effect on an Oklahoma court's ability to entertain a private civil claim, regardless of its basis, against an employer. Here, the employer was an Indian tribe, a sovereign entity that had not waived its immunity from being sued in and subjected to the jurisdiction of Oklahoma courts, at least in the area of workers' compensation. Regardless of whether the employer's workers' compensation statutes treated employees better or worse than the Oklahoma workers' compensation statutes, an Oklahoma workers' compensation court lacked jurisdiction to hear the employee's claim because the employer had not consented to allowing such an action to be brought against it, which was the essence of sovereignty. The employee's forum was a tribal court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the claimant sustained a work-related injury, he filed a workers' compensation claim only against the PEO and its carrier.

Thereafter, the claimant filed a district court action against the employer, its principal, the PEO, and others. Summary judgment was granted in favor of the employer and its principal, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that both the PEO and its client (the employer) were considered employers for workers' compensation purposes, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 40, &sect; 600.7(E) (2002). Under the exclusive remedy doctrine in Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 12 (2001), the employer and its principal were immune from tort liability in the district court. A first instance determination of workers' compensation liability in the proper forum was required to afford the employer and its principal due process. Moreover, judgments from the workers' compensation court were certified due to the default of the PEO. There was no payment obligation or default on the part of the employer or the principal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank filed suit against the debtor in an underlying matter, and it obtained a default judgment. The bank recorded the judgment, and it properly perfected a judgment lien on the debtor's real property. Thereafter, the debtor and her husband filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. At issue on appeal was whether a pre-existing judgment lien on a debtor's real property survived a bankruptcy discharge in light of Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 706(E)(2) (2001). The appellate court noted that there was no evidence that the bank's pre-existing, valid judgment lien was disallowed or avoided. Therefore, under bankruptcy law it survived the debtor's discharge, and remained enforceable. Nevertheless, the debtor asserted that under state law, the judgment lien did not survive. The appellate court disagreed because a broad, literal reading of &sect; 706(E)(2) would render it unconstitutional. The legislative intent of &sect; 706(E)(2) was that judgments extinguished by bankruptcy proceedings no longer had vitality to attach as liens to real estate subsequently acquired by a debtor.

Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 49-110(A) (Supp. 2008), that the claimant's colon cancer arose out of and in the course of employment as a firefighter with the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city asserted that &sect; 49-110(A) violated various constitutional provisions. On review, the court sustained the WCC's determination. The court concluded that &sect; 49-110(A) did not violate Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 46, because the statutory presumption was based on a reasonable legislative classification, such classification had a reasonable relationship to the express purposes of the Worker's Compensation Act and public policy, and the claim of municipal firefighters had distinctive characteristics upon which different treatment could be reasonably founded. Although &sect; 49-110 was a special law, with no applicable general law, it did not violate Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 59, because the legislature was entitled to determine that firefighters were particularly vulnerable to exposure to disease-causing smoke and hazardous chemicals, making the presumption related to a valid objective. Additionally, the city failed to show that the statute violated procedural due process because the claimant filed for compensation and the city had access to the courts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff home buyers brought an action against defendant sellers in the District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma, claiming a right of recovery under &sect; 837 of the Oklahoma Residential Property Condition Disclosure Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 60, &sect; 831 et seq. The trial court granted summary judgment to the sellers based on &sect; 837(C)'s two-year limitation period, and the buyers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyers alleged that the sellers disclosed certain foundation problems but denied knowledge of water seepage and additional problems prior to closing of the sale in March 2004. They brought their action in April 2007. Under Okla. Stat. tit. 60, &sect; 837(C), an action under the Act was required to be brought within two years. The buyers argued that the discovery rule applied to toll the two-year period. The court held that &sect; 837(C) was a statute of repose, not a statute of limitation, based on its language, which not only barred any causes of action then existing, but, at the running of the respective limitation periods, had the effect of preventing what otherwise might be a cause of action from ever arising. Because it was a statute of repose, the discovery rule did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was granted sole custody with visitation rights to the mother. The father gave timely notice of his intent to relocate with the children, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 43, &sect; 112.3 (2002), and the mother objected. The court held that a decision to relocate a family rested within the custodial parent's authority subject to the trial court's approval, where the custodial parent was fit and there was no risk of real and specific harm to the children. The court held that the trial court did not properly apply the factors set forth in Okla. Stat. tit. 43, &sect; 112.3(J)(1)(a)-(g) (2002) and had given undue weight to several factors including the effect of the relocation on the mother's visitation schedule and on the parties' finances. The trial court also erred in not considering an alternative visitation plan that would allow the relocation. The weight of the factors in favor of relocation were greater than the weight of the factors against relocation. The court also held that the mother did not sustain her burden of demonstrating that the proposed relocation was contrary to the children's best interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer appealed an order from a workers' compensation trial court (Oklahoma) which awarded appellee employee more than eight weeks of temporary total disability (TTD) benefits, arguing the order was in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 22 (3)(d) (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal raised the single issue of whether recent amendments to the workers' compensation laws regarding the award of benefits for a soft tissue injury reflected a legislative intent to limit those benefits to eight (8) weeks under the facts of the case. The court held that they did not. A claimant seeking TTD benefits for a soft tissue injury under Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 22(2)(c) (2006) could, upon proper proof, be entitled to those benefits listed therein for a maximum of three hundred (300) weeks. A claimant's TTD award was in no way limited by the provisions of &sect; 22(3)(d), which only applied when a claimant was seeking permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits for a &quot;Soft Tissue Injury&quot; as that injury was defined in &sect; 22(3)(d). When a claimant reached maximum medical improvement, or was otherwise no longer considered to be temporarily totally disabled, and sought PPD benefits, such claimant could seek, in addition to his &sect; 22(2)(c) TTD benefits, PPD benefits for a soft tissue injury. There was no error in the trial court's award of TTD benefits to the employee under &sect; 22(2)(c), as it was not limited to the benefits set out for PPD under &sect; 22(3)(d).</SPAN></P>

The District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) dismissed the action on the grounds that: (1) a previous action was deemed dismissed pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 150; and (2) the new action had not been brought within one year of the &sect;150 &quot;deemed&quot; dismissal and was thus time-barred under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 100.

The administratrix challenge the validity of &sect;150 as an impermissible special law in violation of Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 46. The court agreed, noting that: (1) art. V, &sect; 46 required that court procedure apply equally across the board for an entire class of similarly situated persons; (2) Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2004(I) (Supp. 2002) permitted dismissal of an action if an ordinary plaintiff failed to obtain service of summons within 180 days of issuance, but required notice to an ordinary plaintiff, either by the court or by the movant on a motion to dismiss; and (3) Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 150, with its &quot;deemed dismissed&quot; provision, afforded a medical negligence plaintiff no such notice prior to dismissal, and prior notice of proceedings affecting one's rights were at the core of due process protections. Because the new action was commenced within one year of the filing of the trial court's order of dismissal, the action was timely under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 100.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district did not dispute that employees at various schools signed the lease agreements. The school district, however, denied that its board of education was aware of or had ever approved or ratified the leases, and denied that the board of education authorized any payments on the leases or that the applicable statutory accounting procedures had been followed. The school district also argued that because the leases did not contain the requisite contractual provision for mutual ratification of renewal pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 70, &sect; 5-117(B) (Supp. 2006), the lease agreements were void and unenforceable. The school district returned only six of the thirteen copiers and was unable to locate the remaining copiers. The appellate court ruled that use of the leased property, payment, and acceptance of payment during any fiscal year constituted mutual ratification of renewal. However, it was error for the trial court to assess damages against the school district based on the automatic month-to-month renewal provisions in the leases for holdover rents for a period beyond the lease term to the date of trial.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of Garfield County (Oklahoma) granted the city summary judgment. The establishment and its employee and patrons appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding the ordinance invalid, the court noted that Okla. Stat.

In contrast, the ordinance denied entry to 20 year-old service workers even when the services were performed while the establishment was closed, precluded the establishment's hiring of 20-year-old employees even though the employment of such persons in such establishments was permitted by state law, and denied entry to 18- to 20-year-old patrons who did not enter the designated bar area even though they were specifically permitted to enter that area by state law. Although Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 37, &sect; 219 (2001) authorized municipalities to enact ordinances prohibiting or regulating nudity or drink solicitation in low-point beer establishments, this general grant of authority did not authorize a city to regulate the age of admission to such establishments in a manner inconsistent with specific Oklahoma statutes.</SPAN></P>

A jury found the parents failed to correct the conditions leading to the deprived adjudication, and the children had been in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months. Based on these findings, the District Court of Garfield County, Oklahoma, terminated the parents' parental rights. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the parents contended the trial court failed to order specific conditions they had to correct in order to be reunited with the children; they also asserted that they were not at fault for the length of time the children remained in foster care. The appellate court disagreed with the parents' assertion that termination was based on their failure to complete the plan; the jury found that they failed to correct the conditions leading to the deprived adjudication, as required by statute before terminating parental rights. The evidence leading to removal showed that the parents home was not safe for the children: the parents neglected the children's basic hygiene needs as well as their needs to be safe from physical harm, and exposed the children to domestic violence. The record also showed that the parents received trial court-approved individual treatment plans which explained the conditions, and clear and convincing evidence showed that they failed to correct those conditions. Further, the parents did not assert that the State or treatment providers thwarted their ability to correct those conditions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court abused its discretion and erred as a matter of law in excluding relevant evidence proffered by the employer. The employer's offer of proof, which the trial court refused to hear, indicated that eyewitness testimony would have addressed the issue of whether the employee in fact engaged in the activity he claimed caused his injury. The employer asserted that the statute, on which the trial court relied to exclude the evidence, was unconstitutional. The record did not present a question of constitutionality. The trial court interpreted &sect; 17 to mean that once the treating physician established injury causation, the employer could only rebut the presumption of compensability by seeking an independent medical examination. The trial court refused to hear any testimony from the employer's causation witnesses who would have testified that the employee had no contact nor participated in the alleged treatment and carrying of an accident victim. The trial court abused its discretion in excluding evidence directly relevant to the essential issue of whether the employee in fact sustained an injury arising out of and in the course of employment.</SPAN></P>

The land was eventually sold at a tax sale, and it was later inherited by appellant. She sought to quiet titled in the property, but summary judgment was granted to appellees. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court held that the county treasurer was required to exercise due diligence in sending notice under Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 3106 (2001). In addition, there was a due process requirement under the Fourteenth Amendment regarding notice. This constitutional requirement was violated when not all persons with an interest in the property received notice. As to the returned envelopes, the county treasurer had the duty to follow up under the Fourteenth Amendment and under the statutory due diligence requirement when forwarding addresses were provided. Publication did not cure the defects either. Due to the fact that the tax deed was void, appellant did not have title to the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an owners' association and a corporation, sought a declaratory judgment to declare a statute unconstitutional that required operators to withhold income tax from oil and gas royalty payments made to royalty interest owners who did not reside in Oklahoma. The association also sought an injunction. Summary judgment was granted to defendant Oklahoma Tax Commission (OTC). The association and the corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association was a trade association that represented royalty owners in three states. The cause of action arose out of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution. At issue in this case was the constitutionality of an Oklahoma statute requiring operators to withhold income tax from oil and gas royalty payments made to royalty interest owners who do not reside in Oklahoma. The withholding statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2385.26 (Supp. 2006), was a method of collecting taxes which did not increase the actual tax burden on nonresidents. Additionally, OTC had shown a rational basis for the classification in the statute. The collection method had only an incidental effect on interstate commerce, which was outweighed by OTC's interest in collecting taxes before the income leaves the state. The statute passed constitutional muster, and OTC was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a political organization, members, and officers, sued defendants, the Oklahoma State Election Board and officials, alleging that Oklahoma's ballot access laws regarding formation and recognition of a political party were unconstitutional. The District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) granted summary judgment in favor of defendants and denied plaintiffs' request for a declaratory judgment. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that the state's ballot access requirements were unduly restrictive and unconstitutionally interfered with their association rights under the Oklahoma Constitution and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs asserted that state law, including Okla. Stat. tit. 26, &sect; 1-108 (Supp. 2006), required them to collect an unduly burdensome number of voter signatures on the petition, all within too short a period of time. The appellate court determined that &sect; 1-108 did not violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights because the statute did not unnecessarily restrict or infringe upon the associational rights of plaintiffs, and was reasonable and justified by legitimate state interests. The restrictions regarding the time period and the number of signatures were not unreasonable, severe, or discriminatory, because, inter alia, the party had been able to place the name of its presidential candidate on the ballot, using essentially the same procedure, on two previous occasions, and the evidentiary material affirmatively suggested that plaintiffs did not make reasonable efforts to collect the required signatures.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court determined that the trial court's finding that there was nothing in the language of Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-506 (2001) that specifically required a jury trial was reasonable. Also, the claimant's assertion of a Seventh Amendment right to jury trial failed because the Seventh Amendment's guarantee of a jury trial in civil forfeiture cases was not applicable to the states. However, the trial court erred in denying the claimant's request for a jury trial because trial by jury in civil cases involving more than $ 1,500 was guaranteed by Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant suffered a soft tissue injury to her back. She was awarded 8 weeks of TTD benefits, despite medical evidence that it had continued for longer. This appeal followed. In vacating the award, the appellate court rejected the claimant's arguments under Okla. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 6, 7. The claimant had no vested right in any particular workers' compensation remedy prior to the injury, and &sect;&sect; 6, 7 did not place a limitation on the Oklahoma Legislature's power to restrict the benefits recoverable for soft tissue injuries. Therefore, the claimant's due process rights and right to a certain remedy had not been violated. However, there was a conflict in Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 22 with regards to TTD benefits for soft tissue injuries. The 8-week limit in &sect;&nbsp;22(3)(d) clearly conflicted with the 300-week limit in &sect; 22(2)(c). The appellate court used the rules of statutory construction to determine that the reference of &sect;&nbsp;22(3) to &sect;&nbsp;22(2) controlled. Therefore, &sect;&nbsp;22(2) permitted an aggregate award of up to 300 weeks of TTD in a soft tissue case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was vacated, and the case was remanded for an award of TTD consistent with the medical evidence and the statutory interpretation on appeal.</SPAN></P>

All property remained on the tax rolls and was subject to ad valorem taxation. Only the property's increase in value in excess of five percent was capped and not assessed.

Because the freeport exemption under Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 6A was self-executing, the tax assessed on the taxpayer's property was illegal and void. However, the trial court's determination was based on its erroneous legal conclusion that Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2902.2 (2001) was unconstitutional because the March 15 deadline nullified the freeport exemption; &sect; 2902.2 was not unconstitutional. Because the taxpayer did not file its list by the March 15 deadline, it was delinquent, and it suffered a statutory penalty pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2836(C) (2001). Even though the taxpayer filed past the deadline, it was still entitled to the exemption, but had to pay the penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That portion of the summary judgment ordering a refund of ad valorem taxes paid on constitutionally exempt property was affirmed; that portion of the summary judgment ordering a refund of the penalties paid on the property was reversed and remanded to the trial court for a proper determination of the correct penalty amount.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) brought a condemnation proceeding against defendant property owner under Okla. Stat. tit. 66, &sect;&sect; 51-60 (1991), seeking an easement for the construction of a railroad. On remand, the District Court of Rogers County (Oklahoma) denied the property owner's motion to dismiss, overruled the property owner's objection to a report of commissioners, and ruled in favor of PSO. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that PSO had established that its condemnation of the property owner's property was for a public use and was reasonably necessary. The property owner argued that the &quot;date of take&quot; used for the valuation of his property was in error because, although his property was valued as of December 28, 1992, the date the commissioners filed their report, PSO's right to condemn was not established until November 15, 2004, when the trial court entered the order. The appellate court rejected the property owner's argument because (1) under Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 24 and Okla. Stat. tit. 66, &sect; 56 (2001), the payment of the award to the court clerk authorized PSO to enter onto the property and construct its rail spur regardless of his subsequent appeal, and (2) there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's ruling that the rail spur construction constituted a public use justifying condemnation. The property owner's argument that federal preemption applied was precluded by an adverse ruling he obtained from the Surface Transportation Board. Ample evidence supported the conclusion that PSO lawfully exercised its power of eminent domain in condemning the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a forfeiture action to obtain money found in a car near drugs, and notice was provided in three ways. In 2000, a default judgment was granted to the State because the claimant failed to answer. In 2004, the claimant filed a motion to vacate the default judgment. The request was denied, and the claimant sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The record showed no due process violation because the claimant was provided with service of process, and he failed to respond within the 45 day period under Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-506(D) (Rev. Supp. 2005). Next, the State's act of providing the arresting officer's affidavit setting out the factual basis of the forfeiture request constituted a prima facie showing of the nexus between the drugs and the money found in close proximity. The burden then shifted to the claimant to rebut the showing, but he chose not to answer. As such, his arguments concerning lack of evidence failed. Finally, the claimant's request was time barred under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1038, and Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 06 (2001) did not provide for incarceration as a disability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the District Court of Payne County, Oklahoma that denied defendant's denied defendant's motion to quash and sustained a decision by the Department of Public Safety (DPS) revoking defendant's driver's license under Oklahoma's &quot;implied consent&quot; statutes,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect;&sect; 751 through 754 (2001 &amp; Supp. 2005). Defendant claimed his arrest was invalid because the campus police officer was outside his jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the campus officer was outside his jurisdiction; but the trial court upheld the validity of the arrest because defendant committed an &quot;offense&quot; in the officer's presence; therefore the officer was entitled to effect a &quot;citizen's arrest&quot; under Okla. Stat. tit. 22 &sect; 202 (2001). On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred to the extent it found that, even if the campus officer was outside his jurisdiction, he nonetheless made a valid &quot;citizen's arrest&quot; because a campus police officer may not make an arrest outside school property while acting in the capacity of a campus police officer. However, the court held that the officer's arrest was valid because the officer was within his jurisdiction where the city and the university had entered into an agreement that extended jurisdiction of campus police officers to property surrounding and adjacent to the campus. The court held that such agreements were specifically authorized by the Oklahoma Campus Security Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 74, &sect;&sect; 360.15 through 360.21 (2001), and that the circumstances of the case fell squarely within those contemplated by the city and university agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school funding association challenged a judgment of the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) that determined Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association challenged the trial court's findings. On appeal, the court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect;&sect; 2817(E) and 2817.3 (2004) were unconstitutional. The court found that the statutes violated Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 50; Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 22; and Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 8. The court found that without using the language of an exemption, Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2817(E) directed the assessor to exclude the value of desulphurization equipment from the valuation of an oil refinery's property and Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2817.3 implemented Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2817(E) by providing a procedure to apply for &quot;exclusion&quot; of the property. By withdrawing the desulphurization equipment from ad valorem taxation, the statutes created an ad valorem tax exemption, yet they did not provide a substitute tax as required by Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 50, and Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 22, and because the statutes allowed refineries taxed ad valorem to be assessed at less than 10 % of its fair cash value without the voters' approval, they violated Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 8. The court also noted that the exemption did not qualify under Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 6B and Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2902.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that plaintiffs had an unbroken chain of title under the Marketable Record Title Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 16, &sect; 71 et seq. (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed based on different reasons. The court first rejected the trustee's arguments based on after-acquired title or estoppel by deed. The court next determined that a 1929 mineral deed was the &quot;root of title&quot; in plaintiffs' chain of record title, 40 years after the filing of which plaintiffs could rely for establishing marketable record title (MRT) in the minerals under the subject property, unless plaintiffs' MRT was subject to other &quot;interests or defects&quot; excepted from application of the Act by Okla. Stat. tit. 16, &sect; 72 (2001). The court determined there was no &quot;interest or defects&quot; excepted by &sect; 72. Finally, the court rejected the trustee's claim that the MRTA was unconstitutional. It required the trustee's predecessor in interest, after the filing of the mineral deeds in plaintiffs' chain of title, to perform reasonable conditions to demonstrate his intention to retain his minerals; either file a Okla. Stat. tit. 16, &sect; 74(a) (2001) notice or other &quot;title transaction&quot; or be in &quot;continuous possession&quot; as defined by &sect; 74(b). He did not do that, and a 1971 warranty deed in the trustee's chain of title was filed too late to preserve the pre-root interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed an application with the OTC seeking refund of gross production and petroleum excise taxes paid. The taxes were imposed pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1008 (1994) and Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1106 (2001). The taxpayer claimed that the oil production was from restricted Indian land he had inherited. The question on appeal was whether Oklahoma had authority to levy these taxes on oil and gas produced from restricted Indian land. The taxpayer argued that the Act of May 10, 1928, was unconstitutional as applied to him because he had a vested right to an exemption from taxation applicable to his grandfather's allotment of 1903. He also argued that the collection of the illegal tax was a breach of fiduciary duty. The appellate court noted that the agreements between the United States and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation did not provide for perpetual taxation exemptions. The 21-year tax exemption provided under the Original and Supplemental Creek Agreements expired well before Congress enacted the Act of May 10, 1928. A continuation of restrictions on alienation of land did not continue the taxation exemption. The provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2373 did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer and the insurer argued that the employee became aware of his job-related injuries in May 2000 when he first received medical treatment for those injuries, and that the law in effect at the time of the employee's awareness of his job-related injuries controlled the rights and obligations of the parties. The appellate court found that under Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 11(B)(5), the law then in effect at the time the insurer assumed the risk, and the law in effect at the time of the employee's last hazardous exposure in his single employment, the insurer on the risk on the last day of exposure was solely liable where the claimant worked for a single employer for the 90 days prior to last exposure. The employee worked only for the employer over the last 24 years, during which he was last hazardously exposed to the repetitive-trauma dealing conditions of that employment for more than 90 days, and the insurer was the insurance carrier on the last day of the employee's exposure. Pursuant to the statute, the insurer was consequently liable for payment of the employee's benefits.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 172(B)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The workers' compensation trial court adjudicated claimant as having a permanent total disability (PTD) arising from the combination of the pre-existing disabilities and the disability attributable to the claimant's latest work-related injury and held the employer liable for the payment of the PTD. The trial court also determined that vocational rehabilitation was not practicable. The three-judge panel affirmed all findings, with a modification on the compensation rate. The court rejected the employer's contention that the amended version of Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 172, which became effective in May 2000, violated the employer's rights under the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV because it shifted liability away from the state-operated Multiple Injury Trust Fund. The employer did not have any vested rights in having the Fund pay a portion of the PTD when claimant's last injury occurred after the effective date of the amendment to Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 172. It was not error for the trial court to conclude that vocational rehabilitation was not practical based on the claimant's testimony and evidence and the report of the vocational rehabilitation expert.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the order of the three judge panel of the workers' compensation court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners argued that the trial court erred in dismissing the insurance company and holding the insurer solely liable for the employee's injuries under Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 11(B)(5). The appellate court found that it was undisputed that the employee suffered a cumulative trauma injury while working for the employer, and, although aware of the injury in March 2000, was last exposed to the cumulative trauma dealing hazards of the employment in August 2002. From and after the effective date of &sect; 11(B)(5), the employee's &quot;awareness&quot; of his cumulative trauma injury was irrelevant to the determination of the &quot;date of injury,&quot; by force of that section, determined solely by reference to the date of last exposure. The insurer assumed the risk on or about March 1, 2002, over a year after the effective date of the statute and was charged with notice of the law then in effect. The insurer suffered no increased obligation to pay greater benefits than when it assumed the risk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer one denied respondent employee's claim for a cumulative trauma injury. The employee was found to have sustained a compensable injury and the employer was ordered to pay for medical treatment. Employer one's request to join respondents, employers two and three, was granted, but it was found solely liable for the employee's benefits. A three judge panel of the Oklahoma Workers' Compensation Court affirmed. Employer one appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, employer one challenged the trial court's finding that it was solely liable for the employee's injury and argued that Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 11(B)(5) (2001) was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that it was uncontroverted that the employee was employed by employer one for a period in excess of 90 days, and that during that period he was exposed to injury causing trauma, even though he was only actually working three, 12-hour workdays a week. This was sufficient to satisfy &sect; 11(B)(5). The appellate court also looked to prior cases which addressed the constitutionality of &sect; 11(B)(5) and agreed that it was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and had a rational relationship to a permissible public goal. The rule of imposing sole liability on the last employer satisfied two problems associated with cumulative trauma cases, i.e., proof and assignment of responsibility; assignment of responsibility to the last employer satisfied a &quot;rational basis test&quot; because it provided a definite measure of relief to the worker. As such, the appellate court held that &sect; 11(B)(5) did not violate employer one's constitutional right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 1-702b (Supp. 1999) required new facilities to pay a fee to the uncompensated care fund. This was then distributed pro rata to other facilities in order to pay for uncompensated care. The hospital contended that &sect; 1-702b was unconstitutional, and the trial court agreed. In affirming, the court determined that &sect; 1-702b violated Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 14 because it assessed a tax and distributed it to private entities without any governmental control. The fee in question fell within the definition of a tax, and there was no public purpose since private corporations were benefitted without any control by the State. Next, Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 15 was violated because the distribution of the fee to the private corporations constituted a gift. There was no contractual obligation to provide indigent care. The court also noted that Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 59 was violated because it was a special law imposing significant tax burdens on new facilities based on an arbitrary and irrational classification. Finally, the court was unable to sever the unconstitutional portions of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the department challenged the trial court's reversal of the revocation of the driver's driving privileges. The appellate court found that the officer had reasonable cause to follow the driver based on information from his fellow officers; the driver was stopped when she made a right turn without using her turn in violation of Edmond, Okla., Ordinance &sect; 10.32.060. The appellate court found that this ordinance did not comport with Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 11-604(A) (2001). But the burden was on the driver to challenge the presumption of validity of the ordinance; she presented evidence that she complied with the state statute and asked that it be noticed by the trial court. Nonetheless, the appellate court held that because there was no controlling precedent that the city's ordinance was preempted, then it was presumptively valid at the time of the stop. As a result, the traffic stop was valid even though the ordinance was inconsistent with state law, and the trial court should not have reinstated the driver's driving privileges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case originated from a Department wage claim filed by the claimant against the company. The company asserted and the trial court held that Okla. Admin. Code &sect; 380:30-3-6 was unconstitutional because it permitted either the Department or a claimant or both to meet the primary burden of proving a wage claim. The appellate court found no error. The Department was a &quot;party&quot; to the proceedings as defined by the Oklahoma Administrative Procedures Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 75, &sect; 250 et seq. (2001). The appellate court observed nothing inherently wrong with permitting the Department and a wage claimant to share the burden of proving the correctness of a previously issued order of determination. Thus, the Department was entitled to participate as an advocate in the wage claim hearing, and the amended rule allowing such participation was valid. Okla. Admin. Code &sect; 380:30-3-6 was constitutional, and the appropriate standard of proof under Okla. Admin. Code &sect; 380:30-3-6 was a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the nursing home challenged the trial court's decision to award attorney's fees to plaintiff pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 1-1918(F) (2001) of the Nursing Home Care Act (Act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury returned a verdict of $5,000 in actual damages and $40,000 in punitive damages to plaintiff. The trial court awarded $77,056 in attorney's fees, reduced from the plaintiff's initial request of fees in the amount of $115,375. The court rejected the nursing home's contention that it was entitled to have the reasonableness of the attorney's fees submitted to a jury. The record was insufficient to establish the nursing home's contention that negligence per se under the Act was not presented to the jury. The jury returned a general verdict and plaintiff was thus entitled to fees under the Act. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in assessing a reasonable fee amount that represented the complexity of the case and the time expended by plaintiff's counsel. The attorney's fee bore a rational relationship to the total damage recovery of $ 45,000. The award of the attorney's fee did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Okla. Const., art. II, &sect; 6, because the decision to award successful plaintiffs under the Act, and not award successful defendants, served a compelling state interest to encourage private enforcement of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the award of attorney's fees to plaintiff. The court remanded the matter to the trial court to assess appeal-related fees to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of Ellis County, Oklahoma, declared that Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 6-205.1(A)(3) (effective 2003) was unconstitutional, and it modified the driver's license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver had his driver's license revoked for three years. The revocation was alcohol-related. At the end of the second year of revocation, &sect; 6-205.1(A)(3) was amended. The driver completed his incarceration, paid all fines, and attended all the classes that were required of him for his driving under the influence of alcohol convictions. The driver sought to have the revoked license modified so that he could drive to and from his work. The driver argued that the statute's amendment was an unconstitutional usurpation of legislative power over the judicial branch. In the alternative, the driver argued that because his license was revoked under the former law, he was eligible for modification under that statute, and the amendment did not apply to him. The appellate court determined that the driver had no constitutionally protected right to a driver's license. It was a conditional privilege subject to suspension. Further, the legislature's revocation, with no room for modification, was a rational and reasonable remedy to promote the public policy of highway safety.</SPAN></P>

He engaged in several acts relating to prescriptions. Thereafter, the Board filed a complaint against the physician alleging unprofessional conduct.

On appeal, the court determined that the record supported the finding that the physician allowed a receptionist and a chiropractor to stamp his signatures on prescriptions, which constituted aiding and abetting the unlicensed practice of medicine under Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 509(15) (2001). Further, he prescribed narcotics to patients without an examination, in violation of &sect; 509(13). His actions constituted a violation of Oklahoma law under &sect; 509(10). The court noted that the Board had the authority to enforce Oklahoma Board of Narcotics laws and regulations under Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 503 (2001). Also, the physician failed to maintain records in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 509(19).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a permanent classified correctional security manager, received a letter from the DOC informing him that he was to be involuntarily demoted and transferred. The employee sent a notice of appeal to the MPC by certified mail. The MPC received the notice and dismissed the appeal as untimely. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment against the employee on his claim seeking a declaration that the MPC's rule, which was that appeals were deemed filed only upon receipt, was unconstitutional. The MPC's rule violated Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 46. The rule created an unnecessary burden on those employees who lived far away from the state capitol and placed them at a disadvantage to those who lived near the capitol. Moreover, the MPC put forth no argument that application of the mailbox rule would create any burden on its operations. The court ruled that the mailbox rule, under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 990A(B), applied to the MPC appeals. The mailbox rule specified that the date of filing or the date of mailing, as shown by the postmark affixed by the post office, constituted the date of filing of the petition in error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed a claim in February 2003 that she suffered cumulative trauma injuries to the hands, arms, and shoulders while employed at her prior job and her current job with the employer.

The employer denied that the employee had sustained an injury arising out of and in the course of her employment. The workers' compensation court held that the employee had sustained cumulative trauma to the identified body parts from 1996 through her employment with the employer. The workers' compensation court applied Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 11 (B)(5) (2001) and held the employer liable for all the benefits it awarded. There was no dispute that the employee had worked for the employer more than 90 days when she made her claim. The appellate court affirmed the judgment and held that application of the &quot;last exposure doctrine&quot; to cumulative trauma injuries was proper. Further, as the employee became aware of her injuries after the enactment of &sect; 11(B)(5), there was no impermissible retroactive application of the statute to the employer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners association sought declaratory judgment from the District Court of Cleveland County, Oklahoma, barring defendant city from enforcing against construction of new residences a tax designed to finance improvements to, and expansion of, the city's wastewater system. The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment. The association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association argued that, because the city levied the excise tax ordinance when it issued a building permit, the tax was properly classified as an ad valorem tax upon property and was thus invalid under Oklahoma law. The court disagreed and affirmed the summary judgment granted to the city. The court stated that the excise tax ordinance came into play based only on the single event of a property owner's application for a permit to build a residence that would be served by the city's wastewater system. Therefore, the ordinance imposed an excise tax upon a particular use of property, and adoption of the excise tax ordinance was a valid exercise of the city's taxing power under Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 20, Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2701 (2001), and Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2705 (2001). Additionally, the ordinance violated neither the equal protection provisions of the federal or state constitutions nor the unanimity requirement of &sect; 2701(A), because the city could create classes of taxpayers for the purpose of financing improvements to its wastewater collection system and treatment facility where there was a rational basis for the classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that the Oklahoma EITC, patterned after the federal EITC, created a social welfare or income-transfer program, affecting an impermissible gift of public money from tax receipts to a special class of individual recipients without a valid underlying public purpose. The appellate court agreed with the state officials and found that the state EITC was patterned after the federal EITC, and, as part of the larger state taxation scheme, had to be regarded as a tax refund. Funds held to fulfill the state EITC obligation never become part of state revenue subject to appropriation. The Oklahoma Constitution permitted the legislative creation of different classes of taxation, including exemptions and refunds. The EITC addressed the valid public purpose of economic stimulation.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the appellate court found that issues of fact precluded summary judgment as to whether appellees, through the hospital, qualified for the privileges of the GTCA. The matter was remanded to the trial court, which again granted summary judgment to appellees. On appeal again, the court found that the trial court correctly found that the hospital was a public trust created for public benefit, that the hospital was a political subdivision within the definition of Okla. Stat. tit. 51, &sect; 152(8)(d) (Supp. 1996), and that appellants had not filed written notice of their claim as required by the provisions of the GTCA. The court also found that denial of appellants' motion for summary judgment, based on their constitutional contentions, was proper, and that the hospital had properly responded to appellants' discovery requests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate filed suit alleging defendants, the department of corrections and prison officials, violated his right to practice his religion because he was housed in a cell with a non-Muslim. The department and the officials filed a motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment. The District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case with prejudice. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate, claiming adherence to the Islamic faith, asserted violations of the U.S. Const. amend. I, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000CC-1 et seq, and the Oklahoma Religious Freedom Act (ORFA), Okla. Stat. tit. 51, &sect; 251 et seq. (2001). On review, the appellate court found that the inmate failed to demonstrate that the department's policy of randomly assigning cellmates substantially burdened his right to exercise his religion: the policy did not inhibit or constrain the inmate's religious conduct; it did not curtail his ability to express adherence to his faith; and it did not deny him a reasonable opportunity to engage in those activities that were fundamental to his religion. Further, the department's policy of randomly assigning cellmates was reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives. As the inmate failed to make a showing of &quot;substantial burden&quot; under either ORFA or RLUIPA, he was not entitled to a declaratory decree that his rights were being violated under those Acts. The appellate court concluded that the trial court properly granted summary judgment as there existed no genuine issue of material fact.</SPAN></P>
