The appellate court found that the State provided defendant with notice of its intended use of the convictions prior to trial. The challenged prior convictions all implicated the critical element of dishonesty, as such, the probative value of permitting use of the convictions outweighed any prejudicial effect. The laboratory report was admissible as a business record as the testimony established that the report was made in the regular course of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's business. The forensic scientist who testified was a custodian or other qualified witness of the record under Tenn. R. Evid. 803(6), and, as such, qualified to testify as to the business records. Defendant failed to object to admission of documents regarding his six prior felony convictions, therefore waiving the issue for review. Regardless, defendant had six valid prior felony convictions in the state and satisfied the criteria for classification as a career criminal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant, as a multiple offender, to four years for the habitual offender conviction and to eleven months, twenty-nine days for the DUI conviction. On appeal, defendant raised the following issues: (1) whether the evidence presented at trial was sufficient; (2) whether the MVHOA was unconstitutional; and (3) whether the trial court erred by admitting the results of defendant's blood alcohol test into evidence. His contentions were rejected. The evidence was more than sufficient to find that defendant was guilty of DUI. The MVHOA did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Finally, the trial court did not err by allowing defendant's blood alcohol test results into evidence. There was no proof that defendant refused to submit to the testing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted rape and aggravated burglary. He filed a new trial motion, which the Criminal Court for Sumner County, Tennessee, denied. He brought a delayed direct appeal before this Court. The instant court affirmed defendant's conviction, but remanded the case for re-sentencing. The new sentence was ultimately affirmed. After the trial court denied defendant's petition for post-conviction relief, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant complained he did not receive a fair post-conviction hearing because he was erroneously denied access to the transcripts of evidence and the technical record for his case. The appeals court found that despite defendant's contentions, the transcripts were made available to him when the post-conviction court ordered the State to file them with the court clerk's office. The State complied with the order. Further, in light of defendant's admitted presence at the crime scene, the impeachment value of the victim's affidavits would not have changed the outcome of his trial. Consequently, the defendant was not prejudiced when the State withheld several affidavits made by the victim. Finally, as defendant's trial counsel was not representing defendant at the time that he wrote to the assistant district attorney, he was able to reveal recent statements made to him by defendant because those statements were not made in the context of the attorney/client relationship. Additionally, the revealed confidences, if any, were necessary for counsel to formulate his defense against defendant's accusation that counsel provided ineffective representation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal Court for Hamilton County, Tennessee, convicted defendant of driving under the influence, fourth offense, and driving on a revoked license. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his prior DUI convictions were facially invalid and thus could not be used to enhance his conviction. The appellate court found that, in order to qualify for relief from a judgment, it had to be evidence from the document that the convicting court lacked jurisdiction. The failure of the judgment to note compliance with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403(g)(1) did not implicate the jurisdiction of the trial court. Any failure to comply with the procedural requirements of the statute would not render a judgment facially invalid. As to the other convictions, even if the trial court failed to fully comply with the rules regarding the acceptance of guilty pleas, the convictions would be voidable and not void. Defendant's prior DUI convictions from Georgia could be used to enhance the sentence for defendant's subsequent DUI convictions in Tennessee. The implied consent form for the breathalyzer test was not vague or misleading, as the average person understood that the results of the test would be used against them. An amendment to the Post-Conviction Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-30-201 to-310, did not render a prior caselaw ruling invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Bedford County Circuit Court (Tennessee) of four counts of first degree premeditated murder. The same jury imposed a sentence of death for each count of murder. Defendant appealed evidentiary and constitutional challenges to the convictions and sentences of death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to murdering his 4 children, ages 4 to 12. Defendant relied upon the insanity defense at trial. Defendant presented evidence at trial that he was suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning and major depression and that he was experiencing the delusion that his children's lives were sufficiently terrible to render death the preferable solution. The appellate court held that (1) the jury had the right to accredit the State's expert witness that the defendant was not rendered incapable of premeditation; (2) Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-11-501(a) (1997) was not unconstitutional simply because it placed the burden on defendant to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was unable to appreciate the nature or wrongfulness of his actions at the time of the charged offense; (3) that while the courtroom acoustics were less than favorable, there was no evidence that it presented a case of prejudice; and (4) the jury properly considered the aggravating factors of the multiple deaths and the ages of the children in issuing the death sentence. The court also rejected the rest of defendant's arguments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two different juries convicted defendant for aggravated rape, rape, aggravated robbery, robbery, especially aggravated kidnapping, and aggravated kidnapping. Defendant received an aggregate sentence of 66 years' imprisonment. The convictions related to four victims and resulted from two trials in the Knox County Criminal Court, Tennessee, which were consolidated for purposes of the instant appeal by defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the consolidated rape trial, all four victims were young, white female prostitutes working in the same vicinity. Three victims were taken by defendant to the same remote area. The fourth victim was taken to an animal barn at a zoo. In each case, defendant forced the victims to perform oral sex on him, and he attempted and/or accomplished vaginal and anal sex of each victim. The case involving one of the victims ended in a deadlocked jury. The appeals court concluded, inter alia, that the trial court erred in consolidating the fourth victim's case with the other three cases under the distinct design category of common scheme or plan evidence. Although all four victims were hired for sex and voluntarily got into defendant's car, three victims had pleasant drives with defendant, who drove them to the same, remote location, where he then attacked them. In contrast, when the fourth victim got into defendant's car, defendant pulled out a gun and then drove erratically to the barn. Because of the factual differences in the fourth victim's case, the evidence of the offenses against her were improperly admitted in the trials of the others. As a result, defendant was prejudiced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed the judgments of conviction in the first rape trial and those convictions in the consolidated rape trial for the offenses against two of the victims. The appeals court reversed the convictions for three counts of aggravated rape and one count of especially aggravated kidnapping of the fourth victim in the consolidated trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two different juries convicted defendant for aggravated rape, rape, aggravated robbery, robbery, especially aggravated kidnapping, and aggravated kidnapping. Defendant received an aggregate sentence of 66 years' imprisonment. The convictions related to four victims and resulted from two trials in the Knox County Criminal Court, Tennessee, which were consolidated for purposes of the instant appeal by defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the consolidated rape trial, all four victims were young, white female prostitutes working in the same vicinity. Three victims were taken by defendant to the same remote area. The fourth victim was taken to an animal barn at a zoo. In each case, defendant forced the victims to perform oral sex on him, and he attempted and/or accomplished vaginal and anal sex of each victim. The case involving one of the victims ended in a deadlocked jury. The appeals court concluded, inter alia, that the trial court erred in consolidating the fourth victim's case with the other three cases under the distinct design category of common scheme or plan evidence. Although all four victims were hired for sex and voluntarily got into defendant's car, three victims had pleasant drives with defendant, who drove them to the same, remote location, where he then attacked them. In contrast, when the fourth victim got into defendant's car, defendant pulled out a gun and then drove erratically to the barn. Because of the factual differences in the fourth victim's case, the evidence of the offenses against her were improperly admitted in the trials of the others. As a result, defendant was prejudiced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed the judgments of conviction in the first rape trial and those convictions in the consolidated rape trial for the offenses against two of the victims. The appeals court reversed the convictions for three counts of aggravated rape and one count of especially aggravated kidnapping of the fourth victim in the consolidated trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the victim was leaving a store, she was abducted by a man wearing a ski mask and carrying a revolver. As the man drove away in the victim's car, he ordered the victim to blindfold herself. After driving for some distance, the man stopped. A second car stopped also, and a second man, later identified as defendant, got into the car with the victim and the first man. Defendant and his co-defendant drove the victim around at gunpoint, stopping at several locations. During these stops and while inside the vehicle, the victim was vaginally and anally raped. During a struggle for a gun, the victim's blindfold came off, and she saw defendant's face. The victim eventually escaped. The appeals court found defendant was not improperly denied his right to self-representation at his post-conviction hearing, since he had no constitutional or statutory right to same, the common law right to self-representation was not a fundamental right, and the trial court was not barred from appointing counsel if necessary to aid in the proper administration of justice. Because defendant did not show prejudice, his claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and prosecutorial misconduct failed.</SPAN></P>

As a result, the victims had to pay additional amounts to have their homes finished. The appellate court held that based on the evidence presented at trial, there was sufficient evidence to convict the defendant of three separate counts of misapplication of contract funds. The appellate court upheld the consecutive sentences imposed based on the fact that defendant had similar convictions in Delaware, and the three separate convictions in Tennessee. The court also found that restitution orders were proper as the amounts calculated by the court adequately reflected the pecuniary losses to the victims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grand jury indicted defendant for assault, official misconduct, and official oppression.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose out of an arrest in which defendant, a police officer, participated. The victim testified that as he was being arrested for domestic violence, defendant began choking him. At trial, defendant's former wife testified that she saw an officer kicking the victim, but she could not identify who it was. Other officers at the scene also testified at trial. On appeal, defendant first contested the constitutionality of the statute governing his conviction, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-16-402(a)(1). The appellate court concluded that the statute was sufficiently clear and concise to provide adequate warning to police officers so that they might avoid the prohibited conduct. Sufficient evidence was presented from which the jury could determine that defendant committed acts relating to his employment as a public servant that constituted an unauthorized exercise of official power. The bill of particulars provided sufficient details about the charge to enable defendant to prepare his defense. Like the trial court, the appellate court concluded that an instruction on an officer's duty to arrest and the penalty for failure to arrest were not warranted.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that it had determined the identical constitutional attacks made by defendant against the act during the pendency of the appeal, and found the attacks to be without merit. Defendant's argument that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction was also without merit. Three witnesses testified for the State. Two agents testified that defendant sold crack cocaine to one of them. A forensic scientist testified that the substance was crack cocaine weighing 22.8 grams. The apartment where the sale took place was less than 1,000 feet from a public school. There was no evidence to the contrary. There was no explanation as to what was improper about the sentencing; thus, defendant was properly sentenced in the absence of an adequate record on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Coffee County, Tennessee, granted defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment for driving under the influence, second offense. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the State failed to provide him with a copy of the department of safety printout at the arraignment, as required by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403(g)(3)(ii). The State argued that the provision requiring that defendant be given a copy of the printout of his driving record at the time of arraignment had to be construed as directory rather than mandatory. The appellate court found that the indictment, in compliance with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403(g)(2) (Supp. 2001), alleged that defendant had previously been convicted of DUI. Defendant should have filed a motion requiring the State to produce a copy of the driver record when the document was not provided at the arraignment. In the event that the State totally failed to ever produce a copy of the document to a defendant pre-trial, any remedy would have to be limited to the use of the document as prima facie evidence of a prior conviction. The language of the statute was directory. The statute related to the time of doing an act and did not provide a penalty for the State's failure to give defendant a copy of the printout. Penal statutes that provided penalties were classified as mandatory statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a Franklin County, Tennessee, jury of aggravated burglary and theft of property. Defendant appealed his conviction, but the appeal was dismissed. Defendant then sought post-conviction relief, and the post-conviction court found that the defendant was deprived of effective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the post-conviction court granted the defendant a delayed appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The home of the victim was burglarized. A witness saw a blond-haired man standing near the road by the home, cradling guns. Later, a police officer stopped a brown van that was being driven by the defendant. Three shotguns and jewelry were discovered. The van's passenger had blonde hair. The passenger implicated defendant. After reviewing the record, the appellate court decided that there was more than sufficient evidence to corroborate the passenger's testimony. As to the stop of the vehicle, the police officer's decision to follow and stop the vehicle was reasonable, based upon the objective observation that defendant was driving erratically. The trial court properly determined that the State had established the requisite chain of custody for introduction of the seized guns into evidence. Although certain information was not disclosed to defendant, this did not prevent an effective cross-examination of the passenger, despite the late disclosure. The State's promise of leniency to the passenger was not material, so it did not need to be disclosed. Finally, there was no merit to defendant's claim that he was denied a fair trial or effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The Criminal Court for Wilson County (Tennessee), after a jury trial, convicted him of premeditated and intentional first degree murder, and murder committed in perpetration of aggravated child abuse. The convictions were merged, and he was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's grandmother had mental illness. Defendant's wife discovered the body of their baby daughter dead in her crib. Defendant admitted that he smothered the infant. His defense was insanity. Trial evidence showed that, in the weeks before the murder, he was under stress from work and began to act oddly and preoccupied, making strange religious claims. Defendant claimed God told him to sacrifice his daughter for Christ's coming. He stated that he initially argued with God about it, it was horrible to do, and he hoped his wife would not find him doing it. He hung up on 911 when his wife first called. He told police and psychologists that he knew the act was against the law of men, but that he was obeying God. Psychologists testified that medicine for mental illness helped his condition and he did not seem to be malingering. There was neither life insurance on the child nor prior child abuse or marital problems. The appellate court found that, although the proof showed defendant was severely mentally ill, he failed to show that his illness resulted in his inability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions. There was no proof of &quot;passion&quot; for voluntary manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

The State petitioned the juvenile court to transfer defendant to criminal court to try her as an adult. The juvenile court granted the petition and held that reasonable grounds existed to believe that defendant murdered the victim, was not committable to an institution for the mentally retarded or mentally ill, and that the interests of the community required putting her under legal restraint. Defendant contended that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 37-1-134 violated equal protection. The appellate court held that &sect; 37-1-134 did not violate equal protection as it applied equally to all juveniles in the state. Also, as no suspect class was involved in the case, the legislature only had to have a rational basis for enacting the legislation; protecting society from violent juvenile offenders met the rational basis test. Defendant's claim that her double jeopardy rights were violated also failed. The trial court's refusal to give defendant's sleep defense instruction was harmless error as other instructions sufficiently advised the jury about the required culpable mental state necessary to convict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a petition to declare defendant a habitual offender under the Tennessee Motor Vehicle Habitual Offenders Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 55-10-601 to 618. The State alleged defendant had committed three traffic offenses during a five-year period, thereby qualifying himself as a habitual offender.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued the State's petition should have been dismissed for non-compliance with the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure. He specifically contended the petition and order filed by the State did not constitute proper process under those rules, that the order was invalid because it was not signed by an attorney of record, and that the Tennessee Motor Vehicle Habitual Offenders Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 55-10-601 to 618, was unconstitutional because it violated separation of powers between the judicial and legislative branches. Defendant complained the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure should prevail, as the exclusive procedure. The appeals court disagreed. It concluded the procedure outlined by the Act augmented the terms of the civil rules and provided a legitimate, alternative method of notice. The court also held that court orders did not require the approval of an attorney before becoming effective. Finally, the Act did not unconstitutionally infringe upon the authority of the judiciary to issue rules governing court process, as the Act merely provided a supplemental procedure for bringing a civil matter to the attention of the courts.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that testimony of officers regarding the sale transaction, substance, and distance from school was sufficient evidence to support the jury's findings of guilt; the trial court did not commit error in admitting evidence of the second drug transaction, as the trial court substantially complied with the requirements of Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with possession of 1000 grams or more of methamphetamine with intent to deliver.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought no medical attention for a severely burned child. The appellate court held evidence showed defendant acted knowingly, the child's injuries were extremely painful, and he was subjected to a substantial risk of death, sufficiently supporting an aggravated child neglect conviction.  Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-15-401, -402, were not vague or overbroad for not defining &quot;injury,&quot; &quot;neglect,&quot; and &quot;welfare.&quot; Misdemeanor reckless endangerment, under Tenn.

However, the finding of defendant's guilt of the offense charged, to the exclusion of other, instructed, lesser-included offenses, rendered the trial court's failure to instruct on reckless endangerment harmless.

The appellate court found a rational jury could find defendant made a material false statement in an official proceeding with the intent to deceive. The definition of materiality in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-16-701(1) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. While an officer's testimony of a statement made by the confidential informant was erroneously admitted hearsay, the error was harmless. The evidence did not support defendant's requested instruction on ignorance or mistake of fact. Any deficiency in the indictment was adequately cured by the State's response to defendant's motions for a bill of particulars. Enhancement and mitigating factors were correctly applied in arriving at defendant's sentence, and he was not a suitable candidate for alternative sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal Court for Washington County (Tennessee) of reckless aggravated assault. The trial court imposed a fine and ordered defendant to pay restitution for the victim's medical bills and wages lost as the result of the attack. The trial court then sentenced defendant to two years' incarceration, but suspended the sentence, and ordered that she be placed on three years' probation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had two children that were born out of wedlock. The father of one child was in prison and did not support the child. The father of the other child supported the child. Defendant cut her victim's face with a razor blade during a fight outside a nightclub. The trial court decided that defendant, who had a low paying job and lived in government housing, was a good candidate for probation. The trial court as a condition of probation ordered defendant to seek legitimacy of the child whose father was not in prison. Defendant alleged the trial court's legitimation requirement violated her right to privacy and was an unreasonable condition of probation. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion to set conditions of probation by ordering that defendant legitimate her daughter. To whatever extent the trial court's order that defendant legitimate her child violated her right to privacy, the requirement that she do so to ensure payment of restitution to the victim was clearly related to defendant's crime and the principles of the Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's murder and defendant's history were greatly publicized. This did not require the trial court to change venue, since it was not shown the jurors who tried defendant's case were prejudiced against him. Removal of a juror for cause who stated her belief in the death penalty was not required. Defendant did not show that a variety of circumstantial evidence did not allow the jury to reasonably infer his premeditation about killing the victim, as well as his intent, or to infer that he handcuffed and chained her to prevent her escape before killing her. Testimony of the owner of the bar at which defendant and the victim were present before she disappeared about those events was relevant, but her opinion of defendant was not. The admission of this opinion was harmless error. The jury's instruction that it had to unanimously agree to a life sentence, without an instruction on the effect of a non-unanimous verdict, was not unconstitutional. The jury did not have to state verbatim, on the verdict form, the aggravating circumstances it found, nor that it found them beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant's death sentence was proportional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought a delayed appeal, in the Criminal Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), because his trial counsel had failed to perfect his appeal from his sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because defendant successfully sought, through post-conviction proceedings, a delayed appeal on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel, any other allegations should have been dismissed without prejudice pending the direct appeal. Such dismissal would not be on the merits, and a subsequent petition would therefore not be subject to summary dismissal. Thus, should the delayed appeal prove unsuccessful, defendant could refile for post-conviction relief, alleging any substantive grounds he had. The trial court's determination that the present petition was time-barred was erroneous. Defendant pursued his delayed appeal to the Tennessee Supreme Court, which denied his application for permission to appeal. He thereupon had one year in which to file his petition for post-conviction relief, which he did. Defendant's instant petition was timely filed and alleged grounds for relief which had not been waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged denial of his request for post-conviction relief, contending that his guilty plea was involuntary, because both the State and his trial counsel failed to inform him that, due to the nature of his crimes, he would serve 100 percent of his sentence; and that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue a second mental evaluation, and for failing to request a bill of particulars. The court of appeals disagreed. The rationale that defendant and his trial counsel undertook in entering a plea was in order to avoid consecutive sentencing. The essence was not due to his understanding his time would or could be reduced after serving less time. Thus, the plea was voluntarily made and not based on the alleged advice of counsel. Further, there was no showing that a second mental evaluation would have helped the defense. Finally, defendant failed to argue to the trial court, counsel's failure to file a bill of particulars; thus the claim was waived on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers received approval to establish a driver's license checkpoint. No advance notice was given and no traffic cones or signs were set up warning of the roadblock. As the officers were checking a driver's license, defendant stopped at the roadblock. Assuming it was an accident, he maneuvered around the stopped vehicle when the officers summoned him to stop. The officers then began arguing with defendant, an altercation ensued, and defendant was arrested. Defendant was convicted after his motion to suppress was denied. On appeal, he argued the checkpoint was unconstitutional and it failed to satisfy the requirements for a constitutional suspicionless stop. The appellate court noted driver's license roadblocks were subject to the same requirements for constitutional reasonableness as sobriety roadblocks. The appellate court held the driver's license checkpoint was an unreasonable seizure because the State failed to provide a compelling interest for it and was constitutionally unreasonable given the lack of advance public notice, the failure to have signs or traffic cones, and the testimony suggesting the roadblock was a subterfuge for unlawful detentions.</SPAN></P>

The driver of a car turned the vehicle around and approached the victim. The driver appeared behind the victim, grabbing her left shoulder and telling her to get into his car. The victim clearly saw a knife. A struggle ensued. The victim was able to remember the license plate number of the car driven by her attacker. An officer proceeded to defendant's mother's home, and she consented to the search. The officer did not use fraud or trickery to obtain entry to the house, but, rather, informed the mother that he needed to talk to her son. The seizure of the knife and the shorts defendant was allegedly wearing was the result of a lawful search incident to his arrest. The show-up identification of defendant was non-suggestive and reliable, and the kidnapping statutes were not unconstitutionally vague. Finally, as to sentencing, defendant: (1) had a previous history of criminal convictions or criminal behavior in addition to those necessary to establish the appropriate range, and (2) was on bail from a felony charge at the time of the offense. The trial court properly considered all of the relevant sentencing factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had three prior DUI convictions. Two of these convictions occurred within 10 years of the date of commission of the offense which was the subject of the instant appeal. However, all three convictions occurred more than 10 years prior to the date of the conviction in the instant case. On appeal, defendant argued Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403(a)(3) was unconstitutionally vague regarding when a defendant was to be sentenced as a multiple DUI offender. He specifically asserted the 10-year period to determine whether a prior conviction could be used to determine a multiple offender had to be from the date of conviction of the prior offense to the date of conviction of the present offense. The State argued that as long as the most recent offense occurred within 10 years of a prior conviction, the prior conviction could be used to establish the status as a multiple DUI offender. Because &sect; 55-10-403(a)(3) was ambiguous, the appeals court construed it against the State and held that it measured the relevant time periods from conviction to conviction without reference to the date of commission of the offenses. Thus, defendant could not be sentenced as a multiple DUI offender.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed because defendant failed to demonstrate that the alleged deficiencies of his trial counsel would have made any difference in the outcome of his trial. Defendant's trial counsel relied on discovery provided by the State and by defendant's prior attorney and did not file any suppression motions because defendant's theory of defense was that the drugs were not his. The appellate court refused to speculate what defendant's witnesses might have said at trial that would have made defendant's trial defense more credible, because they did not testify at the post-conviction hearing. The appellate court found that defendant, himself, was largely to blame for the fact that he did not spend more time with trial counsel preparing his trial testimony and he failed to show that additional preparation would have changed the outcome of the trial. He testified at trial as to his version of the facts, but the jury did not believe him, as evidenced by the verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1986, defendant was convicted of aggravated rape, enhanced by a finding of habitual criminal status. After petitioning for post-conviction relief, he was re-sentenced in 1994 to 40 years' confinement. On 30 May 2001, he filed a new petition for post-conviction relief in the Shelby County Criminal Court (Tennessee), attacking the validity of the 40-year sentence. The trial court found the petition was time-barred. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time the defendant's sentence became final, in June 1994, the statute of limitations applicable to post-conviction proceedings was three years. In 1995, the Tennessee Legislature reduced the statutory period for filing post-conviction petitions from three years to one year. Because the previous three-year statute of limitations had not expired at the time the new act went into effect, his right to petition for post-conviction relief survived under the new act. Therefore, defendant had until May 1996, or one year from the effective date of the new act, to file for post-conviction relief. Defendant did not file his petition until May 2001, five years after the statute had run. The grounds raised in this petition and on appeal did not fall within any of the exceptions to the statute of limitations. Post-conviction relief was unavailable to defendant since he failed to challenge that the sentence was void or voidable based upon a right guaranteed by the United States or Tennessee Constitutions. The appellate court found summary dismissal of the petition was mandated under the provisions of the 1995 Post-Conviction Procedure Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-206(b) (1997).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee), by jury, convicted defendant of murder and aggravated robbery; found Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to three assaults and was on parole. A woman won 50 $ 100 bills gambling. Her father-in-law in Tennessee and his neighbors saw her and/or her car and/or a man assaulting her, and the man's car. A driver in Mississippi later saw a similar car at an abandoned house's driveway. The woman's body was found there with blunt face trauma and gunshot wound. Defendant assaulted a federal border officer who pulled him over. He had 14 $ 100 bills. One fiber consistent with the woman's clothing was found in his car. His wife said he said he had taken her to the abandoned house then robbed and killed her. She led police to retrieve the woman's hidden property. The appellate court held that the evidence was sufficient. A video at the casino had caught defendant leaving soon after the woman. The indictment's failure to reference Mississippi was not fatal. As the crime had started in Tennessee, it had jurisdiction. Given his tumultuous marriage, the marital privilege did not apply to his wife's testimony. Evidence from her recently-spurned lover, prosecuted boyfriend, and cuckolded husband merely raised conjecture as to others' motives, and was properly barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions and sentence of death were affirmed. The aggravated robbery sentence was reduced to 20 years as a Range II offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of especially aggravated kidnapping and two counts of aggravated robbery. The Criminal Court for Shelby County, Tennessee, sentenced him to two 11-year sentences for the aggravated robbery convictions and to two 22-year sentences for the especially aggravated kidnapping convictions, all to be served consecutively. Defendant appealed after his new trial motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the two victims began to leave a store parking lot in their vehicle, a car occupied by defendant, a juvenile, and another person pulled into a nearby parking space. Defendant jumped into the back seat of the victims' car and threatened them with a gun. A victim was ordered to drive to a more secluded area. Defendant took several items from the victims' purses. On appeal, defendant argued the trial court lacked jurisdiction to try him as an adult. The appeals court found a valid transfer to criminal court based upon an unrelated aggravated robbery charge was sufficient to divest the juvenile court of jurisdiction in all pending and subsequent criminal charges against defendant. Further, as the language in both indictments for especially aggravated kidnapping substantially mirrored the applicable statute and clearly indicated the indictments were based on the actual use of a deadly weapon to accomplish the kidnappings, such language put defendant on notice of the crimes against which he had to defend. The trial court applied the wrong sentencing enhancement factor regarding defendant's prior juvenile delinquency adjudications. Thus, length of sentence was inaccurate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court modified defendant's sentences for the two aggravated robbery convictions, but affirmed the sentences for the two especially aggravated kidnapping convictions and the trial court's imposition of consecutive sentences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he could not be punished as a third DUI offender under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403(a)(3) (Supp. 2000), because there was insufficient proof as to his oldest conviction. Some of the records of the case, which was over 14-years-old, had been destroyed pursuant to official policy. The record of his first DUI conviction consisted of a copy of the docket sheet, a certified copy of a computer-generated printout, and the testimony of the judge who took defendant's guilty plea. While there was no documentary evidence that defendant was represented by counsel when he pled, the judge testified that he never accepted guilty pleas on DUIs from uncounseled defendants. The appellate court held that the State met its burden to prove the conviction by clear and convincing evidence. Further, the statute was not unconstitutional as an ex post facto law, because defendant was being punished for his current, not his past, behavior. Nor was the statute, though poorly drafted, void for vagueness, as it gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of the conduct which it forbade.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was acquitted of driving under the influence but convicted of driving under the influence per se in the Criminal Court for Davidson County (Tennessee). He was sentenced to serve 11 months and 29 days, suspended except 15 days, and a $ 500 fine. He appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to bar the introduction of his breath alcohol test results. Defendant could challenge the foundation for admitting the results during trial. The results were admitted without expert testimony as the testing officer testified (1) the test was performed according to Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) standards and operating procedure; (2) she was certified under those standards; (3) the instrument was certified by the TBI 32 days before the test; (4) defendant was observed for 22 minutes before the test not to have foreign matter in his mouth, consume alcohol, smoke, or regurgitate, during that time; (5) she followed prescribed procedure; and (6) she identified the test results. Adult driving while impaired was not a lesser-included offense of driving under the influence per se. The only evidence at sentencing, the presentence report, was not provided to the appellate court, so the trial court's jail sentence was presumed correct. Under Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14, a jury had to impose a fine over $ 50, absent a waiver. There was no evidence defendant waived a jury's determination of that issue.</SPAN></P>

The victim had about $ 140 with him; he was wearing a gold herringbone necklace and a gold ring. As he was walking away from the game, someone grabbed his shirt from behind. The victim spun around and was shot in the lower groin area. Upon demand, the victim handed the assailant the money. The co-defendant yanked the necklace from his neck and took the ring. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding evidence of the troubled childhood of the defendant as irrelevant. The evidence failed to make it more probable or less probable that the shooting by the defendant was an act of self-defense. There was sufficient justification for the disparity between the sentences of the co-defendant and defendant. Defendant was not denied due process or equal protection. The record indicated that defendant was offered a plea agreement of 15 years and rejected it, choosing rather to go to trial, as was his right. The co-defendant's convictions and sentences resulted from his agreement, while defendant's convictions and sentences resulted from the trial and sentencing processes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion for correction of illegal judgment was not a proper means to invoke the appellate court's review. He could seek review of an order denying a petition to correct an illegal judgment by a petition for writ of certiorari. An illegal sentence could be corrected at any time. His challenge to an illegal judgment or sentence was generally made through an application for writ of habeas corpus. Defendant's allegations did not establish that the judgment was void or that his sentence was illegal. As long as the words in his indictment showed the offense for which he was charged, failure to cite the statute did not render the judgment void. Reference to the code section was mere surplusage. The indictment sufficiently notified defendant of the crime he was charged with, gave notice to the trial court so a proper judgment could be entered, and protected defendant against double jeopardy. The judgment form's reference to a repealed statute was merely clerical in nature and did not render the judgment void. Defendant alleged no facts which would render his conviction or sentence illegal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant and his co-starter of the LLC claimed they did nothing wrong in using the money for business expenses. In total, the hotel paid the LLC $ 127,174. Defendant claimed he paid $ 154,926 for the projects at the hotel. Two other subcontractors claimed to have been drastically underpaid. Hotel personnel claimed that defendant had said he would take advantage of bankruptcy and escape his debts, and that he threatened them. Defendant continued business under another name. He was convicted. The appellate court held that the jury instruction on Tenn. Code Ann. 66-11-140 prima facie evidence of intent to defraud (nonpayment), was regarding a permissive rather than mandatory presumption; thus the statute was neither unconstitutional nor did its use constitute plain error. Two witnesses testified as to the phone call.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's counsel was appointed as a full-time judge and the case was reset for trial well beyond the 180 days from the date that counsel assumed judicial office. The Supreme Court of Tennessee had inherent authority over the judicial branch of government and properly promulgated Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 10 to uphold the standards of judges and those who practiced law before the courts. Although Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 17-1-105 did not have a 180-day limitation, Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 10 was more restrictive and took precedence. The requirement of Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 10, Canon 4G, that a newly elected or appointed judge wind up a law practice as soon as reasonably possible and in no event longer than 180 days after assuming office was unambiguous and absolute. Defense counsel was in violation by continuing his representation beyond the 180-day limitation. A violation of the rule was a violation of a disciplinary rule. Failure of the State to seek disqualification at an earlier time did not waive the issue. Defendant would not be prejudiced by the disqualification of defense counsel as the fact that counsel was paid for representation was irrelevant to the issue of disqualification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that defendant's petition was barred under Tenn.

Defendant's petition was filed more than three years after the Tennessee Supreme Court denied his application for permission to appeal. In addition, defendant's notice of appeal from the trial court's denial of post-conviction relief was untimely, and the appellate court found that the interest of justice did not require waiving that time requirement. Defendant claimed that the limitations period for filing his post-conviction petition should have been tolled because he did not learn about the supreme court's decision until more than two years later. But the appellate court found that application of &sect; 40-30-202(a) did not deprive defendant of due process, because all that was required was that the law be sufficiently clear to give a reasonably understandable warning of its requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant went to one of the victim's homes with the express purpose of scaring someone he had earlier seen go in the house. Defendant deliberately emptied his assault rifle into the house and knew that the assault rifle was capable of killing someone; thus, the evidence was sufficient to find that defendant knowingly killed one victim. Therefore, the appellate court affirmed the defendant's convictions for one count of second degree murder and two counts of attempted second degree murder. Defendant contended that his statements to a police officer should have been suppressed due to an unconstitutional interrogation. Because defendant was not in custody when he made statements to the officer and his confession was voluntary, the trial court properly denied his motion to suppress his statements to the officer and his confession. Finally, the appellate court agreed with the trial court that defendant's actions demonstrated the need for, and appropriateness of, consecutive sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Haywood County, Tennessee, determined that the seizure of defendant's vehicle was unconstitutional and granted defendant's motion to suppress. The State filed a motion to reconsider. The trial court denied the State's motion and entered an order suppressing the evidence against defendant. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers searched defendant's commercial motor carrier without a warrant. The State argued that the search was constitutional under the pervasively regulated business doctrine, which was an exception to the warrant requirement. In order for the warrantless search to be reasonable, there had to be a substantial government interest for the inspection, the warrantless inspection had to further the regulatory scheme, and the inspection program had to provide a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant. The appellate court held that the third requirement was not satisfied. The appellate court held that the regulations limited the scope of the search, but that they did not limit the discretion of the officer in the field determining when to conduct a search. Thus, the decision to perform a safety inspection was arbitrary and unpredictable and the regulatory scheme was not a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had already appealed his convictions, where the only issue on appeal was the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions.

Defendant had already been granted a direct appeal; he was thus not &quot;denied the right to an appeal from the original conviction&quot; as required for relief under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-213. Even if the post-conviction court had found that defendant was prejudiced by the purported deficient representation of trial counsel, and that defendant was prejudiced and entitled to post-conviction relief, the trial court, under the appropriate statutes, should have voided the judgment and ordered a new trial or, if the deficient performance was related only to sentencing, ordered a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Franklin County (Tennessee), denied petitioner's request for post-conviction relief from entry of his conviction after he pled guilty of selling marijuana, as the trial court found the request for relief was time barred. Petitioner appealed that denial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Postconviction petitioner pled guilty in 1987 to a charge of selling marijuana. In 1996, he claimed in his postconviction request for relief that his conviction was infirm because he was hampered by ineffective assistance of counsel and was &quot;unlawfully&quot; induced to plead guilty. The post-conviction court found the petition was time barred and dismissed it. The petitioner then filed the affidavit of a man who claimed the prosecutor's statement of a factual basis for the petitioner's 1987 guilty plea incorrectly stated that the petitioner sold marijuana to the man. Later, petitioner filed the affidavit of his ex-wife. That affidavit stated petitioner was not present at any time during the drug transaction to which he pled guilty. Petitioner's counsel characterized the request for relief as a motion to reopen. After the trial court denied the motion, the appellate court found it could not consider the denial of petitioner's motion to reopen, as petitioner was required, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-217, to file an application seeking permission to appeal denial of that motion in the appellate court within 10 days of the denial, and petitioner had not done so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Petitioner's request for relief was properly characterized as a motion to reopen a prior postconviction proceeding and was time barred, as the application for permission to appeal the denial of the motion to reopen was not filed within 10 days of the denial as required under Tennessee statutory law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought post-conviction relief, claiming that his guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered, in that he was threatened by a deputy jailer in making it, that his counsel was ineffective, and the State failed to disclose favorable evidence to him. The trial court denied his petition. Petitioner asserted that the court, by virtue of its authority to assure the interests of justice, and to prevent the appearance of any impropriety, should have issued a subpoena to cause the deputy jailer who alleged to have coerced him into pleading guilty, to appear at the continued hearing for the purpose of questioning as to the said allegations. The appeals court rejected this argument, as petitioner offered no authority for it, and further, he failed to establish how his counsel was ineffective. Moreover, there was sufficient evidence in the trial record that the court fully advised him of the consequences of his plea, and was satisfied that it was knowingly and voluntarily entered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of two counts of first degree murder and especially aggravated robbery. Additionally, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress identification testimony and physical evidence seized from defendant's residence, in controlling the selection of jurors, and in permitting the State to introduce victim impact evidence. Also, the appellate court found that the sentences of death were not imposed in any arbitrary fashion, the evidence supported the jury's finding of the statutory aggravating circumstances, and the jury's finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, pursuant a comparative proportionality review, the appellate court found that the death sentences were neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Thus, the appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions for two counts of first-degree murder and one count of especially aggravated robbery and the resulting sentences of death plus 25 years imposed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant told police the victim could not be dead as they did not have a body, before they revealed this fact. Defendant told a cellmate he killed his wife. The victim's body was not recovered. Admission of defendant's post-arrest escape attempts did not abuse discretion. Allowing leg restraints on defendant during trial which the jury could not see did not abuse discretion due to his attempts to escape and arm himself. Allowing defendant to be handcuffed at sentencing, after he attacked a prosecution witness in jail and had an impression of a handcuff key did not abuse discretion. When defendant objected to mitigating evidence, the trial court correctly determined his competence to make that choice. Defendant's statement police did not have the victim's body was initially excluded, but after defendant inquired into that conversation, it was allowed. The jury erroneously considered extraneous crimes in finding defendant was a prior violent offender.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment, based upon a jury verdict, of the Criminal Court for Williamson County, Tennessee, convicting him of driving with an alcohol concentration of .10 percent or more (DUI per se). The trial court found this to be a second offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for DUI, DUI per se, and DUI, second offense. He unsuccessfully attempted to suppress the breathalyzer results. In the first trial, the jury acquitted him of count one, DUI, but could not reach a verdict as to count two, DUI per se. He was retried, and the second jury convicted him of count two, DUI per se, and in a bench trial, the trial judge found this conviction to be a DUI second offense. Judgment was affirmed in part. Double jeopardy did not preclude the retrial on the DUI per se charge. Because DUI and DUI per se contained different elements, an acquittal of either would not have necessarily meant the State could not have proven the elements of the other. Further, the trial court properly admitted defendant's breath test results, as the arresting officer's testimony satisfied the requirements for proving compliance with relevant operating standards. Because defendant failed to show the trial judge's alleged bias or prejudice, fact that judge was prosecutor in a prior concluded trial involving defendant did not mean judge had to recuse himself in instant case. Judgment was reversed in part, as defendant was improperly declared to be a second offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">No double jeopardy violation occurred when defendant was acquitted of DUI and retried for DUI per se due to a hung jury, as the offenses contained different elements. Trial judge was not required to recuse himself simply because he prosecuted defendant's prior DUI conviction. Finally, because defendant was improperly declared to be a second offender, the conviction was reduced to DUI, first offense, and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found appellant guilty of a second offense of driving on a revoked license, and imposed a fine of $ 27,000. Appellant sought review, arguing that the failure of the driving under revocation statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-50-504, to set a maximum fine, rendered that statute unconstitutional for violating the excessive fines prohibition of U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The appellate court agreed, and vacated appellant's sentence, replacing it with a fine of $ 2,500. The appellate court held that &sect; 55-50-504 allowed imposition of fines commensurate with those imposed in felony cases, fines which could be, as in the case, grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense. It held that the remainder of the statute was constitutional, and under the doctrine of elision, struck only that portion the statute,&nbsp;&sect; 55-50-504(a)(2), that failed to set an upper limit on the fines for a second conviction of driving under revocation or suspension.</SPAN></P>

The trial court refused to grant defendant relief, and he sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended he lacked effective counsel because his lawyer did not convince the jury his arrest resulted from obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and day-long exposure to paint and paint-thinner. Counsel presented his theory to the jury, and defendant did not show additional proof would have resulted in a different outcome.  Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-401(a)(1) prohibited driving under the influence of any intoxicant producing stimulating effects on the central nervous system. Defendant's failure to support his claim he could have been sentenced by the jury waived it. Defendant had sued the trial judge and the prosecuting attorney on an unrelated matter, but, his recusal motion having been denied, he did not show prejudice by either individual. Defendant complained of the trial court's refusal to admit evidence and its limitation of his cross-examination, but did not show abuse of discretion. The record did not support defendant's assertion he unconstitutionally pled guilty to the second offense allegations concerning his driving under the influence and driving on a revoked license charges, as the jury convicted him of these offenses.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed he was statutorily entitled to consideration for work release and was deprived of his state and federal constitutional rights to equal protection on the basis that work release was available to individuals confined for his offense in other Tennessee counties. The appellate court found defendant was not statutorily entitled to work release eligibility and was not deprived of his equal protection rights. Defendant did not established statutory eligibility for work release in the county during the service of confinement for his conviction. Further, the statute did not create a mandatory classification for the county that affected defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for shooting the victim to death. On appeal, the instant court affirmed. Because defendant's only sufficiency of the evidence argument was an attack on the eyewitness's credibility, a matter for the jury's determination, his claim failed. Because defendant made no attempt to show that the State's witnesses' arrest histories contained exculpatory evidence, the trial court did not err by refusing to order their production. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing evidence of defendant's prior convictions to impeach his credibility. Defendant's retrial, after his first trial ended in a mistrial due to improper prosecutorial questioning of a witness, did not violate double jeopardy principles because the record supported the trial court's conclusion that the first-time prosecutor made an innocent error and was not attempting to provoke defendant into moving for a mistrial. Defendant was not prejudiced by the State's post-mistrial attempt to enter into a plea agreement, leveraged by threatening to indict him for first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment, based upon a jury verdict, of the Circuit Court for Madison County (Tennessee) convicting him of attempted second degree murder, aggravated assault, and especially aggravated robbery. Defendant also challenged the trial court's denial of his motion for a mistrial based on a potential juror's remarks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a drug deal, defendant's accomplice slit a man's throat with a knife and then slashed the victim in the stomach. He was later placed into the back seat of his own truck by defendant and his accomplice, who drove the victim to a remote area and abandoned the truck with the victim inside. The victim's wallet containing $ 700 was taken. On appeal from his convictions, defendant first contended the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial after a juror allegedly tainted the entire jury pool with remarks concerning his inability to be impartial. The court found that an exchange between the juror and the trial judge revealed no clear prejudice done to defendant. The court also found the evidence was sufficient to support all three of defendant's convictions. However, the court reversed and dismissed defendant's conviction for aggravated assault on the basis of plain error. The evidence used to prove both aggravated assault and attempted second degree murder was the same and, therefore, a double jeopardy violation occurred. Finally, while the trial court erred by failing to charge criminal responsibility for the facilitation of the felonies, the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for attempted second degree murder and especially aggravated robbery were affirmed, as the evidence clearly showed that defendant actively participated in the crimes, even though his accomplice took the lead role. Defendant's conviction for aggravated assault was reversed on double jeopardy grounds. The charges for attempted murder and aggravated assault arose out of a single attack on a single victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of crimes in Montana. Because of crowded prison conditions they were placed in a private prison facility in Tennessee. The men escaped from the prison and were recaptured.

They also alleged the imprisonment in Tennessee was unlawful as it violated their due process rights. The appellate court found that a conviction for escape under &sect; 39-16-605 required neither that the inmate have been serving time for a conviction in Tennessee, nor that the escape be from a public facility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Criminal Court for Johnson County (Tennessee) denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his habeas petition, appellant complained he did not have proper notice of the charges against him, that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence at trial, and that the jury instructions given at his trial were not an accurate statement of the law. Specifically, appellant alleged the indictment and proscriptive statute failed to give him sufficient notice of the charges because the appellate courts at the time of his conviction did not distinguish between the elements of premeditation and deliberation as required under the then-existing first degree murder statute. The trial court denied the petition. Judgment was affirmed. The court held there was no deficiency of notice and that the remaining issues were not cognizable in habeas corpus proceedings. The language in the indictment, which both identified the elements of the crimes charged and referenced the pertinent statute, was sufficient to notify a reasonable person of the crimes with which he was charged, to allow the trial court upon conviction to pronounce the proper judgment, and to protect appellant from twice being placed in jeopardy for the same offense. There was no vagueness or ambiguity in the murder statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed; the indictment adequately charged appellant with two counts of first degree murder, the first degree murder statute was not unconstitutionally vague, and any ambiguities in the caselaw regarding the definitions of the elements of premeditation and deliberation were not shown to be so serious as to render the notice of the charges deficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted on two counts of sale of cocaine. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison. A motion for new trial was filed and later overruled. No notice of appeal was filed. Appellant then filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The petition alleged various factual grounds for ineffective assistance of counsel, including that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to perfect a direct appeal. An evidentiary hearing was held wherein the post-conviction court granted appellant the right to seek a delayed appeal. In so doing, the court denied appellant's request to dismiss the remaining ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Instead, the trial court ordered appellant to file an amended motion for new trial and incorporate all ineffective assistance of counsel claims asserted in the post-conviction petition in the amended motion. The trial court later heard the amended motion for new trial and denied the relief sought. Judgment was remanded, as the post-conviction court failed to comply with the applicable guidelines. The proper procedure would have been for the post-conviction court to grant the delayed appeal and dismiss the remaining issues without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

After his arrest, defendant broke out of the back seat of the police car his was in and fled for 20 to 30 feet. The judgment of the lower court was affirmed. The instant court found that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction for escape because it found the back seat of a police car was a facility designed, built, and installed with the specific purpose of detaining people. The escape statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it was not a statute that men of common intelligence had to necessarily guess at its meaning. Defendant failed to allege in his motion for a new trial that the lower court had failed to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of attempted escape. Because this failure by the lower court did not constitute plain error, the instant court could not review it on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, the defendant's daughter, alleged that defendant had facilitated the stepfather's rape of the victim and that defendant had also been present in the room at the time of the initial rape. The victim testified that she was forced to have sex with her stepfather for several years, and there was physical evidence of both hymen and anal lacerations. Defendant was convicted of criminal responsibility for rape of a child. Defendant appealed, challenging both the conviction and the sentence, but judgment was affirmed. Defendant's videotaped statement was not unconstitutionally obtained, so motion to suppress was properly denied. The defendant came voluntarily to the police department, was informed that she was not under arrest, and left the police department without being detained. In addition, the detective's interview of the defendant was not a custodial interrogation, so defendant was not in custody for Miranda purposes. As to defendant's sentence, it was proper to require defendant to serve 100 percent of her sentence under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-523, because she was convicted as a child rapist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants were each sentenced to death for two murders. The Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) denied the two defendants' remanded petitions for postconviction relief. Defendants again appealed. At issue was application of the three-year Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 limitations statute to bar post-conviction Brady violation claims, and whether mention of felony-murder to be an aggravating factor was harmless error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed defendants' conviction and death sentences for murder of two men during a 1981 robbery. Defendants' motion for post-conviction relief claimed the State did not give them Brady materials until 1993, which they had continuously sought since 1982. The &sect; 40-30-102 limitations period commenced on July 1, 1986 and expired on July 1, 1989. That period did not equitably toll. Defendants were not entitled to an evidentiary hearing based upon mere filing of a Brady claim. The court extensively analyzed application of the Burford tests where delay was beyond a defendant's control. The motion also claimed under the Middlebrooks standard it was unconstitutional to use a felony murder aggravator to enhance a felony murder conviction. The court found that error to be harmless after applying the Middlebrooks harmless error factors. The other aggravators of (1) previously convicted another felony involving use or threat of violence to the person, (2) committed the murders to avoid arrest or prosecution, and (3) knowingly created a great risk of death to two or more persons, other than the victim murdered, during his act of murder, outweighed minimal mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Brady claims were barred by refinement of the Burford test to balance defendant's liberty interest with the State's interest against stale, fraudulent, and expensive litigation, because defendants could not get relief based on pleadings alone, but had to establish at an evidentiary hearing that favorable Brady evidence existed, that it was material to the defense, and was suppressed by the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed and raised numerous issues. The court determined the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for DUI. The trial court did not err in refusing to suppress defendant's statement to the arresting officer that she drank too much rum to drive and her statement sexual proposition to the officer because defendant was not in custody for purposes of Miranda for the first statement and the second statement was spontaneous and unsolicited. The prosecutor's comments during closing argument about the credibility of defendant's husband and about how a person would smell after having a drink spilled on her were not improper. The trial court err in not charging the jury on reckless driving as a lesser-included offense because reckless driving was not a lesser-included offense of driving under the influence. The trial court did not err in accepting the jury's fine recommendation and did not err in sentencing defendant to a short term of confinement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Williamson County (Tennessee) which convicted him for driving while under the influence of alcohol, fourth offense, particularly, for driving while his alcohol concentration was .10 percent or more, in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-401(a)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer, responding to a call, found defendant in the driver's seat with the keys in the ignition, parked in a dirt driveway. After the defendant failed several field sobriety tests, she arrested him. He took the breath alcohol test which resulted in a .21 reading. A jury returned a special verdict, one of three choices, that defendant was guilty of driving with an alcohol concentration of .10 percent or more. The appellate court reversed the conviction as the trial court erred in finding the person who administered the breath alcohol test unavailable. Allowing the taped testimony violated defendant's constitutional right to confrontation. The state did not offer any evidence of any attempt to locate the witness, and thus, failed to show that he was truly unavailable after good faith efforts to obtain his presence, as required by Tenn. R. Evid. 804. However, the doctrine of implied acquittal did not apply to the jury's multi-charge as it was denied the opportunity to consider the other charges. Thus, the State could proceed on the driving under the influence charge. Defendant's other arguments were rejected. The case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and remanded because the trial court erred in finding the breath test operator unavailable and in allowing his videotaped former testimony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed a jury's verdict finding him guilty on all counts and his 72-year sentence, entered by the Criminal Court for Giles County (Tennessee), where he was charged with four counts of selling 0.5 grams or more of cocaine, two counts of selling 26 grams or more of cocaine, one count of facilitation of the sale of 0.5 grams or more of cocaine, one count of selling counterfeit cocaine, and one count of aggravated assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was charged with multiple counts involving the sale of cocaine and one aggravated assault count related to drug sales between defendant and an undercover agent. Defendant attempted to impeach the undercover agent, but was not allowed to ask him about alleged untruthful, prior testimony. Also, the State was permitted to resume its direct questioning about the agent's pending charges. The jury convicted defendant on all counts. He was sentenced to 72 years in prison. He appealed. The court affirmed, but modified the sentences. The court held the evidence sufficiently supported the convictions, defendant waived any challenge to the consolidation of indictments, and jury selection was not improper. The court further held the trial court erred in not allowing the impeachment evidence regarding purported untruthful testimony, but held the error was harmless and said no prejudice occurred concerning the pending charges ruling. The court also held telephone conversation transcripts were properly considered. However, the court held that imposing consecutive sentences on all charges resulted in an excessive sentence and modified the sentence to 46 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgments affirmed as evidence sufficiently supported convictions, defendant waived issue of consolidation of indictments, jury selection process was constitutional, trial court erred in not allowing impeachment evidence regarding undercover agent but error was harmless and no prejudice was shown when State was allowed to inquire on direct about his pending charges, transcript evidence was properly considered, but sentence had to be reduced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction from the Criminal Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) for driving under the influence by attempting to certify a question of law, pursuant to a plea agreement, wherein he argued police improperly pulled him over for failure to use his turn signal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was pulled over by police for failing to use a turn signal while changing lanes and for speeding through a yellow light. The police observed defendant had been drinking and arrested him for driving under the influence. At trial, defendant sought to suppress the evidence of his traffic stop, arguing under state law he was not required to use a turn signal because there were no other vehicles at the intersection. He then entered into a plea agreement with the condition that the question be certified pursuant to Tenn. R. Crim. P. 37(b)(2)(i). On appeal, however, he argued the municipal traffic ordinance was unconstitutional because it conflicted with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 55-8-142, -143, which did not require the use of turn signals unless traffic dictated otherwise. The court held defendant failed to properly certify the question of law because the question he attempted to reserve was not the question presented on appeal. Therefore, the court affirmed the conviction and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed, because defendant failed to properly certify the question of law because his plea agreement stated he challenged the probable cause of police to pull him over; however, on appeal he argued a municipal traffic ordinance was unconstitutional because it violated state law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that he was not allowed to participate in a work release program as part of his sentence. On appeal, he alleged this was error. The appeals court upheld the decision since the county did not have a program and failure to institute a program did not violate defendant's right to equal protection. The statute at issue was equally applicable to all counties. Further, there was no authority giving a trial judge the right to order a misdemeanor sentence to be served in a county other than the one in which the offense occurred. A second argument made by defendant that the trial court should have ordered him to serve his sentence on a periodic basis was also struck down. The appeals court held the trial court was without authority to order the defendant to serve his mandatory minimum sentence on a periodic basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from order of the Criminal Court for Washington County (Tennessee) that denied his petition for habeas corpus, or in the alternative, for post-conviction relief, due to alleged unconstitutionality of jury instruction and ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his conviction and sentencing for first degree murder, petitioner filed a direct appeal, filed two petitions for post-conviction relief, and appealed from their dismissal. He then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and, in the alternative, post-conviction relief. This petition alleged that the jury instructions were unconstitutional and that petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel. The trial court treated this petition as one for post-conviction relief and dismissed it as barred by the statute of limitations. The motion did not state grounds to establish that the conviction was void, or that petitioner had served his sentence, so it could not be construed as a habeas corpus petition. Since challenges to a conviction on constitutional grounds must be made by motion for post-conviction relief, and under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 such motions must be filed within three years of the final action of the highest state appellate court, petitioner's failure to file within the time limit mandated dismissal of his petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment dismissing the petition affirmed, because petition was filed after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted by a jury of second-degree murder and aggravated kidnapping. The defendant appealed, and a court affirmed the conviction, but remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing. Following remand, the trial court sentenced the defendant to serve 22 years incarceration for second-degree murder, and 10 years for aggravated kidnapping. The court ordered the sentences served consecutively. On appeal, the defendant contended that the trial court's sentence for second-degree murder was excessive. The trial court actually imposed a lesser sentence in terms of absolute years on the defendant than the sentence imposed before he appealed; thus, no presumption of a due process violation arose. The defendant also argued that the trial court erroneously enhanced the defendant's sentences following remand. The sentences were, however, within the trial court's discretion. Defendant did have an extensive criminal history, making the imposition of consecutive sentences appropriate under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-115(b)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Consecutive sentences for murder and kidnapping were statutorily appropriate, and sentences were not erroneously enhanced, nor did they violate defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who performed homosexual prostitution, planned, with his girlfriend, to rob and kill the next person who propositioned him, and did so by strangulation.

Appellant pled guilty; aggravators of previous violent felony convictions, especially heinous murder, and murder in the commission of a robbery were found; and he was sentenced to death, which was affirmed. The trial court denied post conviction relief and the court affirmed. Appellant's counsel's admissions of deficient assistance were not binding in the court's ineffective assistance analysis. Even after conferring with counsel appellant had spoken with the media. Given the overwhelming evidence, the decision to plead guilty and avoid a detailed recitation of the facts to seek jury sympathy in sentencing was not incompetent strategy. Appellant's three attorneys had spent over 900 hours on his case and his mitigation expert, over 150 hours. Further mitigation evidence would have been cumulative. Appellant's post conviction evidence had not been new.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a direct appeal from the judgment of the Criminal Court for Sumner County (Tennessee), entered upon a jury verdict, convicting him of one count of rape of a child, two counts of aggravated sexual battery, and two counts of assault, in a suit to determine whether the election requirement was met, whether the warrantless search was legal, whether venue was proper, and whether the evidence was sufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by a jury of one count of rape of a child, two counts of aggravated sexual battery, and two counts of assault. On direct appeal, the appellant's conviction for one count of aggravated sexual battery was reversed, because appellee failed to elect the specific incident upon which it was relying, so there were double jeopardy implications raised by the jury's possible reliance on the same offense to return guilty verdicts for both one count of aggravated sexual battery and one count of rape of a child. However, the judgment was otherwise affirmed because the trial court did not err in denying appellant's motion to suppress the evidence obtained in the warrantless search of the trailer occupied by him and his wife, because his wife had common authority over the trailer, so her consent to search was valid; the constitutional guarantee against convicting an accused for crimes committed outside the county in which the trial court was located was not violated, because the jury could have taken notice of the location of appellant's trailer within the county at issue; and the evidence was sufficient to support appellant's conviction for rape of a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for one count of aggravated sexual battery was reversed, because appellee did not satisfy the election requirement, thus raising concerns that the jury might have relied on the same offense to convict appellant of both one count of aggravated sexual battery and one count of rape of a child. The judgment was affirmed in all other respects, and the case was remanded for a new trial or for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant was charged with the offenses of rape of a child and the attempted rape of a child. Appellant attacked a 6-year old child. He offered her some panties. He then pulled her panties down, digitally penetrated her, and tried to make the child perform oral sex on him; he then left when two individuals approached. Appellant sought to introduce an alibi defense, but did not do so when the State announced it would introduce evidence of his recent sexual assaults having similar characteristics to the assault on the 6-year old. The State did introduce into evidence 400 women's undergarments appellant possessed. Appellant was convicted. He appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the 400 women's undergarments were not relevant to any issue, but admission of them was harmless in light of other evidence. The court also held the evidence sufficiently supported the verdict and the prior, similar bad acts could be used to impeach his credibility. The court further held a photographic array with appellant in it was not unduly suggestive, appellant's sentencing as a habitual offender was not improper, and a challenge to his sentence was waived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgments affirmed because evidence sufficiently supported the verdict, the trial court did not err in ruling that appellant's prior bad acts could be introduced if appellant provided an alibi defense, the trial court did err by introducing several hundred pairs of women's undergarments into evidence, but the error was harmless, no error occurred in not suppressing photographic array, and the trial court did not err in sentencing appellant.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5-14-101 to 5-14-116 (1998), was in effect in 14 counties and made a violation of its provisions a class D felony; in 14 other counties the same conduct was made a class C misdemeanor, and in other counties the same conduct was not a crime at all. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the criminal prosecution because Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 5-14-114 violated the equal protection provisions of both the United States Constitution and the Tennessee Constitution, and the statute was impermissibly vague. The motion was denied and appellant sought review. Judgment was reversed because the classification of a county official's conflict of interest with regard to a county contract as a class D felony in only those counties adopting the County Purchasing Law of 1957, was purely arbitrary and violated the equal protection guaranties. However, the statute was not so vague that the prohibited conduct could not have been ascertained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of first degree murder while perpetrating aggravated child abuse, and aggravated child abuse, in connection with the death of his girlfriend's infant son left in his care. Defendant apparently threw the crying baby, who died from severe cerebral edema. The State declined to add evidence in the penalty phase but the defense presented substantial mitigating evidence. The only aggravating factor was the victim's age. There was evidence this was an isolated unpremeditated incident and defendant could be rehabilitated. But the jury returned a death sentence. The appellate court affirmed the felony murder conviction, but modified the death sentence on proportionality review to life without parole, and reversed the separate aggravated child abuse conviction, as the legislature had not clearly intended cumulative punishment for the abuse where it was the felony in a felony murder conviction. It overruled defendant's constitutional and evidentiary arguments, death sentence challenges, and claims of error in jury selection and instruction and prosecution argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Felony murder conviction was affirmed but sentence was modified to life without parole, as death penalty was disproportionate when compared to similar defendants and issues. Legislature did not intend cumulative punishment for predicate offense in felony murder conviction, so aggravated child abuse conviction was reversed and dismissed. Other assignments of error were overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Criminal Court for Hamilton County (Ohio), convicting her of driving under the influence of an intoxicant, first offense, in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-401.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant's vehicle move from the right-side travel lane of a roadway to a merge lane on the far right-hand side of the road. The vehicle then weaved back over into the slow lane of traffic. The officer stopped defendant and later concluded she was intoxicated based on her performance on field sobriety tests. Defendant was arrested. She initially refused to consent to a blood alcohol test, but signed an implied consent form for the test after the officer told her she would have automatically lost her license for one year if she did not consent. Defendant was later convicted of driving while intoxicated. Upon review, the court found the trial court did not err when it refused to suppress the results of defendant's blood test due to an alleged invalid consent form, as the law required only that the officer advised defendant that if she refused to sign the form she may have had her license suspended. Judgment was reversed, however, as the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to justify the stop of defendant's vehicle simply because the vehicle, was being operated legally, but not perfectly, near an establishment that served alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed; though officer adequately informed defendant she would have lost her driver's license if she refused to take a blood alcohol test, officer's initial stop of defendant's vehicle was in error as he did not have a reasonable articulable suspicion that a crime had been committed or was about to be committed, or did defendant commit any traffic infraction in officer's presence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of possession of cocaine within 1000 feet of a school and possession of marijuana. An informant told a police officer defendant was set to deliver drugs at a restaurant within 1000 feet of a school. Police observed defendant sitting in the passenger side of a vehicle and stopped the car. Defendant was arrested. The police requested consent to search defendant's residence which was within 1000 feet of a different school. Defendant gave them written consent. Police found cocaine and marijuana there. Defendant was convicted on all charges. He appealed. The court affirmed. The court held the Drug-Free School Zone Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-432, was constitutional and that the schools did not have to be in session when the predicate offense occurred. The court also held the search was voluntary, the cocaine convictions involved separate criminal acts, and sentencing was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner robbed then shot a man who had attempted to purchase cocaine from him. After petitioner confessed, a licensed attorney and juvenile court referee ruled petitioner, who was 13, be transferred to the criminal court for trial as an adult. Five months later, petitioner's trial attorney filed a motion for an acceptance hearing, urging the trial court to decline to accept jurisdiction over petitioner because the individual who adjudicated the transfer hearing was not a judge. Motion was denied as untimely. At trial, petitioner accepted a plea offer, limiting his incarceration to 25 years. On appeal, petitioner claimed he received ineffective assistance of counsel in juvenile court and from his trial attorney. Judgment was affirmed. Because petitioner had no right to an acceptance hearing, his juvenile court attorney was not deficient for failing to seek one in a timely manner. Petitioner also failed to prove how he was prejudiced by his trial counsel's failure to certify a question regarding his transfer from juvenile court after his guilty plea, as he clearly wanted to plead guilty despite losing his opportunity to appeal his transfer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's body was found in a community center, stabbed in the neck, chest, upper arm, leg, and ear, and with defensive wounds to a hand. A window or door had been broken by an intruder, and a small refrigerator was missing. Pre-trial, petitioner signed a written statement that he entered the building twice and that the victim accidentally killed himself struggling with petitioner. At trial, petitioner said he was not involved in the homicide. Petitioner was convicted of theft, burglary, and felony murder, which the court affirmed. The court also affirmed denial of post-conviction relief. Petitioner had waived necessity, accident, and self-defense defenses, which were based on his pre-trial statement, since he had not raised them on direct appeal. Also, petitioner had insisted at trial that his pre-trial statement was bogus. Petitioner had no right to a lesser-included-offense jury instruction for the second burglary, the predicate offense for his felony murder conviction, since he was not separately charged with it. The trial court's jury instructions and petitioner's counsel's assistance to petitioner were both adequate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed.

The trial court did not err by refusing to give defendant's jury instruction regarding premeditation because the instruction given informed the jury that defendant had to intend to kill, had to form the intent to kill prior to the act, and had to reflect on the act while free from passion. The trial court erred by dismissing two prospective jurors who stated that they were uncomfortable sitting on a murder case but the error was harmless because defendant's jury was fair and impartial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because the evidence was sufficient to find defendant premeditated the victim's murder, the trial court properly instructed the jury on the element of premeditation, and the trial court's error in dismissing two prospective jurors was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his premeditated and felony first degree murder, aggravated robbery, and conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery convictions, and sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole with a consecutive 10 year sentence for aggravated robbery and a 5 year concurrent sentence for conspiracy, by the Criminal Court for Hamilton County (Tennessee).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After prosecution testimony by his wife and codefendant's girlfriend among others, defendant was convicted of premeditated and felony first degree murder, and conspiracy to commit and aggravated robbery, and sentenced to life without possibility of parole plus a consecutive 10 year sentence for aggravated robbery. Defendant had blamed his codefendant who did not testify at their joint trial. The court affirmed. None of defendant's wife's testimony was barred by the marital communications privilege since practically all of it occurred before third parties. Defendant's U.S. Const. amend. VI right was not violated since recordings of his conversations with codefendant had not been admitted to prove the truth of matters asserted, but rather to provide context for defendant's self-incriminating statements. Defendant's right to counsel was not violated by the recordings since he had been released and not charged at that time. A search was legal because there was no requirement that defendant be delivered an affidavit in support of the search warrant. Though the state wrongly examined witnesses using their written statements, it was harmless error. Defendant did not express regret.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Testimony by defendant's wife did not violate privilege since most of it was of talk before third parties, right to confrontation was not violated since recordings of codefendants' talk was only admitted for context, not truth, in murder trial. Error in allowing state examination of witnesses which wrongly used written statements was harmless, as was error in allowing too many photos of decedent victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted petitioner of first degree murder on counts alleging both premeditation and felony murder; especially aggravated robbery; and theft. The petitioner received a life sentence on the first degree murder charge and term sentences on the especially aggravated robbery and theft charges. After hearing, the trial court denied petitioner's motion for post-conviction relief. On appeal, the court determined that neither a fatal variance nor constructive amendment occurred when the prosecutor misspoke when she said that the jurors would be able to choose whether the felony murder charge was committed in the perpetration of robbery and kidnapping rather than robbery and theft; furthermore, petitioner failed to show that his substantial rights had been prejudiced. The court further held that the probative value of demonstrations as to how the petitioner defended himself was not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice and neither was petitioner subjected to double jeopardy multiple punishments as a result of being found guilty of both premeditated and felony murder.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the issues of failure to challenge admission of fingerprint evidence, based upon state's failure to establish chain of custody; failure to object to reasonable doubt instruction; and failure to request individualized voir dire of prospective jurors due to extensive pretrial publicity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted on two counts of aggravated sexual battery and sentenced to two concurrent prison terms of 20 years. In his motion, appellant contended the statute under which his sentences were enhanced, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-107 (1987 Supp.), was unconstitutional, arguing that because he was convicted of aggravated sexual battery due to the victim's age, his sentences could not have been enhanced to Range II under this statute. The record on appeal consisted solely of appellant's motion and his notice of appeal. Judgment was affirmed on review. The State correctly asserted the appellant had the responsibility of preparing a complete and accurate appellate record. Because the record was incomplete, the reviewing court presumed the action of the trial court is correct. Although appellant challenged his sentence, neither the judgment nor transcript of the sentencing hearing was included in the record.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A rational jury could have found that one defendant's failure to protect a child from abdominal injuries that were inflicted and non-accidental and were consistent with blunt trauma to the abdomen from an instrument, a fist, or a foot, was knowing neglect. The appellate court concluded that evidence was sufficient to support that defendant's conviction for aggravated child abuse through neglect. Evidence was insufficient to support defendant mother's conviction for aggravated child abuse through neglect. Even when the evidence was viewed in the light most favorable to the state, it was insufficient for a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant mother, who was in a shelter while the child was in the care of the first defendant, knowingly neglected the victim in a manner that resulted in serious bodily injury. Because aggravated child abuse through neglect was a continuing offense, there was no requirement that the state or the jury identify a specific serious bodily injury as the basis for conviction. First defendant's sentence was modified to reflect a release eligibility of 100 percent in accordance with statutory requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant mother's conviction for aggravated child abuse through neglect was reversed and the charge against her was dismissed, where she was in a shelter while the other defendant took care of the child and evidence was insufficient to support her conviction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff's department searched the defendant's residence pursuant to a search warrant.

In their certified question, appellants contended law enforcement officers infringed on their rights to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. The court reversed appellant one's conviction and dismissed his charge because the search warrant failed for lack of probable cause, and thus the items seized during the resulting search should have been suppressed. The court dismissed appellant two's appeal because since she had received no conviction judgment, the rule provisions for a rightful appeal based upon a judgment of conviction did not authorize an appeal or an appeal of a certified question in her case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant challenged the stop of his vehicle at a driver's license check roadblock. The Tennessee Highway Patrol supervised the roadblock. Defendant's vehicle was stopped by a city police officer working at the direction of the Tennessee Highway Patrol. The officer smelled marijuana. Defendant's vehicle was searched. Five pounds of marijuana was found. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence found. The police testified no sign warned of the roadblock ahead, no cones were used to direct traffic, and there was no advance publication of the roadblock. The roadblock was visible to oncoming motorists, was conducted in a safe location, and every car was stopped. The trial court suppressed the evidence. The State appealed. The court reversed. The court held the roadblock was constitutionally and legally valid since minor deviations from the guidelines did not make the roadblock unreasonable, any intrusion on individuals was minimized, and law enforcement discretion was limited.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court's judgment granting criminal defendant's motion to suppress reversed and case remanded because the roadblock at which defendant was stopped was constitutional under the federal and state constitutions, and was not illegal merely because defendant was stopped by a city police officer and not the Tennessee Highway Patrol.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder in perpetration of kidnapping and sentenced to death. The use of felony murder as an aggravating circumstance was error and the case was remanded for resentencing. A jury found that the statutory aggravating circumstances, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2404(i)(5), (6) and (8) (Supp. 1981), outweighed any mitigating circumstances and imposed the death penalty. On appeal, defendant asserted several errors. The court held that: the State advanced gender and race neutral reasons for its peremptory challenges; reconsideration of residual doubt testimony was not proper because it did not relate to the defendant's character or record or to the circumstances of the offense; results of a polygraph test had no probative value on the issue of punishment; general deterrence remarks were improper but did not constitute reversible error; a general instruction regarding residual doubt testimony was proper; a juror's receipt of extraneous information was not prejudicial; the sentence was not disproportionate or arbitrary; and evidence supported the jury's finding that aggravating factors outweighed mitigating evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police arrested appellant for possession of a controlled substance within a school zone with intent to sell. Appellant was convicted and the court, sentencing appellant as a career offender, imposed an enhanced sentence under the Drug-Free School Zone Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-432. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 39-17-432, arguing that the statute: 1) violated due process guarantees because it was overbroad and vague; and 2) violated proscriptions against cruel and unusual punishment. The court noted that a statute is overbroad when its language literally encompasses constitutionally protected activity. Section 39-17-432 was not unconstitutionally overbroad because the drug-related activity proscribed by the statute did not enjoy constitutional protection. Appellant's due process argument failed because ignorance of the law was not a defense and the statute's enhanced and mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses within a school zone provided a rational basis for serving legitimate state interests. The court, using a proportionality analysis, held that the gravity of the offense and appellant's pattern of drug dealing supported an enhanced sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; drug-free school zone statute was constitutional because it met substantive due process requirements and provided appellant with notice of proscribed conduct and possible consequences, and gravity of the offense and appellant's pattern of drug dealing supported enhanced sentence.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, part of the question was omitted after the record was not clearly copied. The court dismissed the appeal because the certified question was not properly reserved because the final order did not state that the certified question was expressly reserved as a part of the plea agreement, that the plaintiff State and the trial judge consented to the reservation, and that plaintiff and trial judge were of the opinion that the question was dispositive of the case.</SPAN></P>

Defendants also contended that the State failed to prove that the victims sustained serious bodily injury, which was necessary for a conviction. However, the testimony presented by the State, that defendants pistol-whipped and kicked the victims, including photographs of some of the injuries, was sufficient. The court also affirmed defendants' sentences, holding that defendants' records of criminal activity were &quot;extensive&quot; under Tenn.

The record contained only conclusory allegations that the informant who tipped police that defendant would be carrying drugs was a citizen informant, rather than a criminal informant, and proof of the informant's credibility or basis of knowledge, which was therefore required, was lacking. Corroboration to make up for this deficiency was also lacking. Defendant did not violate any traffic statute and the statute under which he was charged was inapplicable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant, convicted of premeditated murder, appealed from a decision of the Criminal Court of Davidson County (Tennessee), which approved the jury's finding of two aggravating circumstances which were not outweighed by mitigating circumstances, and sentenced appellant to death by electrocution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To convince authorities that he had been murdered, appellant pastor killed and decapitated the victim, starting a fire to obscure the body's true identity. However, it was identified. Appellant, convicted of premeditated murder and sentenced to death, appealed the jury's finding of aggravating circumstances. Affirming, the court held that the statutory aggravating circumstance that the murder were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, in that it involved depravity of mind, was constitutional. Appellant mutilated the corpse as part of his continuing plan to obscure the victim's identity, thus, it was sufficient to support the aggravating circumstance finding. Evidence was overwhelming that appellant embezzled church funds and was motivated to murder the victim to effectuate appellant's disappearance, enabling him to avoid investigation, arrest, and prosecution resulting from his embezzlement. Thus, the jury properly found the aggravating circumstance that appellant murdered the victim to avoid prosecution for embezzlement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Appellant carefully plotted, over a period of months, a cold blooded crime of a brutal and depraved nature, with dismemberment of the corpse merely to avoid potential incrimination for embezzlement. Thus, the jury properly imposed the death penalty based on its finding of aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Defendant shouted &quot;Stop killer cops&quot; several times and was arrested. Several witnesses testified defendant drowned out the whole program and that the master of ceremonies was shaken by the demonstration. A jury convicted defendant. He appealed. The court affirmed. The court held the statute was constitutionally valid, especially since it had the content-neutral purpose of protecting the right of citizens to peacefully assemble and left defendant ample alternative channels to communicate his message. The court also held the statute was not overbroad since the statute punished only those people who had a specific intent to disrupt a gathering. Finally, the court held the evidence supported the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony murder following a kidnapping and robbery. Defendant was sentenced to death on the felony murder charge and to 40 years on each of the robbery and kidnapping convictions. Defendant filed an appeal of his conviction alleging 15 trial court errors, including insufficient evidence to support the conviction, admission of prior conviction, admission of hearsay, and that Tennessee's death penalty statute was unconstitutional. Affirming conviction and sentence, the court held evidence supported the conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court properly weighed the probative value of defendant's prior conviction against an unfair prejudicial effect prior to admission. Hearsay statements were properly admitted as an excited utterance as the statements were made by someone still under the stress or excitement of the traumatic event. Further, the Tennessee Supreme Court had already established the constitutionality of the Tennessee death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment and sentencing affirmed. Evidence supported defendant's conviction beyond a reasonable doubt; hearsay statements were properly admitted under the excited utterance exception; probative value of defendant's prior conviction outweighed any prejudicial effect; and Tennessee Supreme Court had already held the Tennessee death penalty constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. In its order of dismissal, the trial court ruled that the only grounds contained in the petition which could warrant habeas corpus relief were the allegations concerning the sufficiency of the indictment. The court agreed with the trial court's determination. The court found that the trial judge acted within his discretionary authority when he summarily dismissed the petition challenging the sufficiency of the indictment because the petition did not include a copy of the indictment alleged to be deficient.</SPAN></P>

There was no error in the trial court's decision to deny post-conviction relief based upon the summoning of the bystander jurors. Petitioner could not raise complaints of ineffective assistance of counsel based upon alleged new claims when the legal basis for such claims predated his first complaints against counsel. Petitioner was afforded an opportunity to present his constitutional claims in a full and fair hearing in a previous petition for relief and was therefore barred from doing so here. Petitioner failed to cite a specific portion of the record in which he found error; therefore, he waived consideration of the issue on appeal. The decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-The owners were not in contempt of the trial court's previous order, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 29-9-101 to 29-9-108, because it was not clear that the trial court's order prohibited them from posting the security code on the gate during a party to allow late arriving guests to enter individually; [2]-While the neighbors were not obligated to remove the gate, they were not entitled to exclude the owners from the free use of their own property by keeping the gate locked.</SPAN></P>
