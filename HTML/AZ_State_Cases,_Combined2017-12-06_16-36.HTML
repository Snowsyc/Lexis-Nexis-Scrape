Alabama, which held that imposing a sentence of life without parole on a child whose crime reflects transient immaturity violates the Eighth Amendment; [2]-Miller represented a clear break from the past for purposes of rule 32.1(g); [3]-Arizona law, when petitioners were sentenced, allowed a trial court to impose a natural life sentence on a juvenile convicted of first degree murder without distinguishing crimes that reflected irreparable corruption rather than the transient immaturity of youth; [4]-Because Miller reflected a new substantive rule of constitutional law, the rule was given retroactive effect.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 13-1105(A)(1); while his children were initially placed in the closet only while he was away from home and for disciplinary purposes, after about a month, he left them in the closet permanently, feeding them irregularly, then not at all.</SPAN></P>

IQ scores created no mental retardation presumption because some evidence questioned the scores. Jurors were not excluded for death penalty views because (1) a juror was highly conflicted about the death penalty, and (2) another was excused for credibility issues. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-503 barred voluntary intoxication evidence when considering premeditation because, while not a &quot;culpable&quot; mental state under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-105(10), premeditation was part of the crime's mens rea element, under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1105(A)(1). It was not error not to instruct on manslaughter because the jury rejected second degree murder. Sufficient evidence supported the Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-751(F)(8) and (F)(6) aggravators because (1) the murders were temporally and spatially related, and (2) a jury could find they were motivationally related.</SPAN></P>

Defendant waived his presence for the first two days of jury selection and waived his presence on the third day. Defendant's guilty pleas were entered voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly. The victim impact evidence was properly admitted where the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the police officer's sons to wear the clothes similar to police uniforms in the courtroom. The two photographs defendant questioned were relevant to show the impact the officer's death had on his two young sons. The probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, Ariz. R. Evid. 403. The &quot;Last Call&quot; audio record was brief and not inflammatory. The trial court did not err in precluding evidence during defendant's mitigation of marital difficulties between the officer and his wife. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-751(F)(10) was not unconstitutional. The jury was properly instructed on the aggravating factors and could find that defendant's mitigation did not warrant leniency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged a decision from the Pima County Superior Court, Arizona, which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee employer in a wrongful death case based on medical malpractice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a minor patient died, and her father filed a wrongful-death action alleging medical malpractice of a treating physician, who was certified in pediatrics and pediatric hematology-oncology. The trial court found that an expert certified in internal medicine, hematology, and medical oncology was not qualified under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2604. Summary judgment was entered against the father, but the court of appeals partially reversed the trial court's decision. After a remand was ordered, the supreme court granted review. In partially vacating the court of appeals' opinion, the supreme court determined that &quot;specialty&quot; for purposes of &sect; 12-2604 was construed as referring to a limited area of medicine in which a physician could have become board certified. However, the courts of appeals' determination that &quot;specialty&quot; did not include subspecialities was rejected. Section 12-2604 required a testifying expert to be board certified in the same speciality as the treating physician because she was practicing within her specialty of pediatric hematology-oncology. The father's constitutional arguments relating to &sect; 12-2604 were rejected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The opinion of the court of appeals was vacated, except insofar as it vacated the trial court's judgment and directed the trial court on remand to allow an opportunity to identify an expert with the qualifications required by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2604. The case was remanded to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, entered sentences of life with a possibility of parole after 25 years for the first murder count, death for the second murder, and 6 years in prison for aggravated assault.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a death penalty case, the Supreme Court of Arizona reviewed the validity of defendant's plea to two counts of first degree murder before it reviewed the capital sentence.

The circumstantial evidence and defendant's statements supported a finding that he reflected on the killings before pulling the trigger. The record did not show that the State sought the death penalty for a discriminatory or improper reason. The prosecutor's comments did not create fundamental error. At the penalty phase, the State was allowed to present evidence of the circumstances of his crimes. The jury instructions were accurate and not misleading. Given the aggravating circumstances, the jury's imposition of the death sentence was not an abuse of discretion under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-756(A).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was alleged that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-527 (Supp. 2012), which diverted up to 10 percent of certain trust land proceeds to a management fund, violated Ariz. Const. art. 10, &sect; 7(A). The trial court enjoined appellant Arizona State Land Commissioner from designating state trust land proceeds for deposit into the management fund. The court of appeals affirmed, and the supreme court granted review. On review, the supreme court noted that the use of trust lands or their proceeds was not allowed if it involved ways that there not expressly authorized, even if it would have benefitted the trust. The supreme court applied Ariz. Const. art. 10, &sect; 7 according to its terms, and it declined to infer unstated exceptions to its restrictions on the use of state trust land proceeds. The constitutional language here controlled over the common law of trusts. The Arizona Constitution's silence on the payment of the costs of trust management and the fact that such expenditures might have benefitted the trusts were not sufficient grounds for reading exceptions into the Arizona Constitution or the Enabling Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's entry of summary judgment was affirmed, and the decision from the court of appeals was vacated. An award of attorney's fees was entered against the Commissioner.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court noted that a trial court may revoke pro per status for serious violations of court orders and rules even if the conduct occurred outside a courtroom proceeding. Defendant demonstrated that he could not comply with court deadlines and the disclosure rules. A trial judge was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing on a motion for change of counsel if the motion failed to allege specific facts suggesting an irreconcilable conflict or a complete breakdown in communication, or if there was no indication that a hearing would elicit additional facts beyond those already before the court. The record established beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim's murder was especially cruel. The State proved that defendant knew or should have known that the victim was suffering physically and mentally. The mitigating circumstances were not substantial. The State's cross-appeal was moot because the supreme court affirmed defendant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>

Each conviction was probative in the penalty phase to show his character and propensities and to strengthen the weight of the aggravator. While the prosecutor's courtroom conduct of eye-rolling and facial expressions was inappropriate, it was confirmed only twice by the trial judge, who did not think it amounted to such pervasive misconduct as to bar retrial of the penalty phase. The trial court did not err under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-752(G) in allowing the State to present evidence during the penalty phase that defendant claimed to have been at a strip club at the time of the murder. Because defendant claimed he had a low IQ and brain damage, evidence that he claimed to have been at a club when the murder occurred showed he was able to fabricate an alibi.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court noted that the most plausible and harmonious reading of Ariz. Rev.

The testimony supported the trial court's conclusions that the candidate failed to comprehend the questions posed to her. Her testimony showed minimal English language comprehension. The candidate's inability to comprehend English was clear and the trial court properly disqualified her. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the expert's testimony.

The trial court did not err by permitting the State to present evidence of other bad acts defendant committed while incarcerated to rebut his self-defense claim. The State presented sufficient evidence of premeditation, because the jury could infer that defendant lured the victim into his prison cell to kill him. The jury did not abuse its discretion in determining death was the appropriate sentence because it found three aggravating circumstances under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-751(F)(7)(a), (F)(2), and (F)(6): defendant was an inmate when he committed murder, he had previously been convicted of a serious crime, and the crime was especially heinous.</SPAN></P>

There was no abuse of discretion in striking a juror who expressed opposition to the death penalty. The trial court did not err by denying a mistrial. The record did not support appellant's assertion that the prosecutor's courtroom demeanor and behavior amounted to misconduct. Appellant did not explain how a late disclosure prejudiced him, and no prejudice was evident from the record. A manslaughter instruction was not warranted under Ariz. Rev.

Although the trial court erred by instructing the jury at the guilt phase on the State's allegation of dangerousness, the error was harmless.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pima County Superior Court, Arizona, convicted defendant of murder and sentenced him to death.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the facts surrounding the two first degree murders, as well as defendant's felony murders, were relevant to whether defendant deserved leniency. The evidence was not unduly prejudicial. There was no constitutional requirement that the sentencing proceeding jury revisit the prior guilty verdict by considering evidence of residual doubt. The trial court correctly ruled that defendant would need to seek relief under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32 to pursue his claims that prosecutorial misconduct discovered after his direct appeal should invalidate his convictions. The validity of the convictions was not before the trial court in 2009, and defendant's Ariz. R. Crim. P. 24 motion to vacate was untimely. Defendant's due process rights were not violated. The legislature did not need to amend Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-751(F)(1) because the supreme court had previously approved the use of concurrent convictions to establish the (F)(1) aggravator. The jury was properly instructed that defendant's convictions for premeditated murder were punishable by sentences of life imprisonment or death.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, the police were not required to halt the emergency wiretaps when they submitted search warrant affidavits asserting probable cause to search defendant's apartment. Evidence at the suppression hearing also established that conventional wiretaps could not have been obtained through due diligence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Arizona Court of Appeals held that requiring the submission of DNA samples from five juveniles for whom a probable cause determination had been made did not violate the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV. The State and two juveniles petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the issue was whether the State, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, could compel the juveniles to submit to DNA extraction and profiling as a condition of release? The supreme court determined that even if extracting the cell sample did not intrude on privacy to the same extent as a search of the home or the drawing of blood, it remained a search or seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Under the totality of the circumstances test, the issue was whether, and to what degree, that intrusion served important governmental interests. The State had an important interest in locating an absconding juvenile and ascertaining that the person located was the one previously charged. If the State could not obtain a DNA sample from a juvenile before release, it may never have another opportunity to do so. The physical extraction of the DNA was constitutional as to all of the juveniles.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A special action was filed seeking to challenge the Governor's removal of a chairperson from the IRC under Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect; 1(10). The IRC contended that the Governor had exceeded her limited removal authority and that the Governor and respondent Senate had violated separation-of-powers principals. In granting relief, the supreme court determined that it had original subject matter jurisdiction in this case. It exercised its discretion to accept special action jurisdiction because the legal issues raised required prompt resolution and were of first impression and statewide importance. Next, the chairperson had standing because she was displaced from office, and there was no need to determine if the IRC had standing. Further, appellate review of whether the Governor complied with the constitutional legal standards in removing the chairperson was not barred by the political question doctrine. However, the case failed on the merits because neither of the grounds advanced by the Governor amounted to a removal with legal cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his conviction should be vacated because the State's evidence showed only passage of time but not the actual reflection required for premeditation under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1101(1). The supreme court disagreed. Defendant was caring for his fourteen-year old niece, the victim. On the day of the murder, defendant left the motel room and walked to a store where he purchased a rubber mallet. Defendant returned to the motel and hit the victim in the head with the mallet and covered her with a blanket on the bed. Police officers found a bloody black sock containing a rubber mallet hidden under the bed. They also found men's jeans with blood on them. The sock and jeans contained DNA from both the victim and defendant. Police also found the victim's pants &quot;turned inside out, with the panties still within them and the socks within the legs of the pants&quot; as if &quot;somebody had pulled them off.&quot; The medical examiner also found defendant's semen on the victim's body. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to show premeditation and sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Before the trial judge excused Juror 46, defense counsel had a fair opportunity to examine her. The only prejudice defendant could have suffered from admission of statements after page 40 was from a lack of credibility in his protestations of innocence. Defendant did not show that he was deprived of a fair and impartial jury at any stage of the trial. The sanctions imposed for the State's violation of discovery sufficiently protected defendant's due process rights. There was no prosecutorial misconduct. The imposition of consecutive sentences, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-708, was improper and remanded for resentencing on the non-capital counts. Even if the supreme court assumed that defendant proved each of his alleged mitigating factors, the jury still did not err by finding the mitigation insufficient to warrant leniency as to the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff passenger was wheelchair bound. After she boarded a bus, the bus driver secured her wheelchair to the bus floor. As the bus resumed its travel, a car stopped abruptly in front of it, causing the driver to brake sharply. The passenger was thrown from her wheelchair and sustained injury. She sued the bus company and driver. At trial, defendants requested that the trial court instruct the jury that the standard of care required of them was that of reasonable care; the trial court rejected the request and instructed the jury that a common carrier had the duty to exercise the highest decree of care practicable under the circumstances. On review of the judgment in favor of the passenger, the court held that a heightened standard of care was no longer applicable to common carriers. Rather, the appropriate standard of care in negligence actions by passengers against common carrier was the objective and reasonable person standard in traditional negligence law. If the carrier acted with reasonable care in light of all the circumstances, it discharged its duty to its passengers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant walked into a pawn shop and immediately began firing at the shop owner. Defendant took two guns from the shop. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, first-degree burglary, armed robbery, and misconduct involving weapons. The jury found one aggravating factor, pecuniary gain, and sentenced him to death for the murder pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-751(F)(5) (2011). On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's notice of change of judge. The notice was not filed within 10 days after the State filed its notice of intent to seek the death penalty and thus was untimely under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 10.2(a). In denying defendant's motion to suppress a pistol found in his hotel room when he was arrested, the trial court properly found that the search of the room was lawful as incident to his arrest. The jury did not abuse its discretion in determining that defendant should be sentenced to death. Before the murder, defendant had asked his girlfriend to go into the pawn shop and attempt to pawn a chain he had given her.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over the course of a year, defendant abducted and sexually assaulted 10 women and brutally murdered three of them. On review, the court held that the trial court did not err in admitting other acts evidence under Ariz. R.

Further, although the trial court erred in failing to specify in its limiting instruction the purposes for which the other acts evidence was being admitted, the failure was harmless because the purposes for which the evidence was admitted were apparent from the record.

The trifurcated jury proceedings did not violate defendant's constitutional rights because he did not point to any relevant evidence that was excluded from the second penalty jury's consideration because of the trifurcated proceeding, as substantially the same evidence was introduced at the second sentencing trial as at the first. The trial court did not err by striking a juror under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 21-201(3) because he was a convicted felon who did not aver that his civil rights had been restored. Even if reading the transcript of the State's gun expert's guilt-phase testimony into evidence during the aggravation phase violated defendant's Confrontation Clause rights, he failed to show that he was prejudiced, as the testimony was irrelevant to the Ariz.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-751(F)(6)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defendant's murder trial stemming from the rape and murder of a young woman, the trial court did not err in excluding an entry from the victim's diary in which she stated that she had been sexually assaulted while in Europe and would fight back if ever assaulted again. The court rejected defedant's argument that the evidence was admissible under Ariz. R. Evid. 803(3) to show that his sexual contact with the victim was consensual, as the victim likely would have forcibly resisted an assault, because the alleged statements had minimal probative value. The victim's state of mind years before the murder hardly established that she surely would have or could have used a knife or other weapon to prevent defendant's attack. The court further found that the murder was especially cruel under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-751(F)(6) because the victim consciously suffered physical pain or mental anguish during at least some portion of the crime and defendant knew or should have known that she would suffer. The victim surely must have suffered mental anguish while being raped, hit, and strangled, and defendant should have known that the victim would suffer such anguish.</SPAN></P>

The contemplated hearing was not one where the defendant had the right to be present as the hearing would concern purely procedural matters that did not implicate defendant's right to confront witnesses and evidence against him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent insurance carrier determined that the claimant was not permanently impaired. The claimant's treating physician, using the Fifth Edition of the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (AMA Guides), testified at an ICA hearing that the claimant had suffered a 5% permanent impairment based on a resolved lumbar radiculopathy; the carrier's expert testified that the claimant had no ratable permanent impairment based on the Sixth Edition of the AMA Guides. The issue raised was the meaning of the &quot;most recent edition&quot; of the AMA Guides in Ariz. Admin. Code R20-5-113(B). On appeal, the court affirmed. To give the regulation a fair and sensible meaning, the court held that it referred to the standards in the edition of the AMA Guides most recently published before the claimant's impairment was rated. Thus, a doctor would consider the latest medical developments when determining impairment. The regulation did not improperly delegate the power of the ICA under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-921(B) (1995) to the AMA to set the standards physicians had to use to rate impairment because the use of the AMA Guides in impairment rating was discretionary.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-754(A) in not ordering a competency pre-screening of defendant. However, defendant could not establish fundamental error. The record was replete with evidence that he understood the proceedings against him and was able to assist in his own defense. Further, the trial court did not err in declining requested defense instructions because no rational jury could have found that defendant committed a lesser-included offense. He shot a police officer three times at close range in the face and neck during a routine traffic stop, actions almost certain to bring about death. The officer was in full uniform and driving a marked police cruiser with its lights engaged. Finally, the trial court did not err in finding aggravated circumstances. Ample evidence supported the findings that defendant had been convicted of serious offenses, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-751(F)(2), and that he knew or should have known that the victim was an on-duty police officer, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-751(F)(10).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2006, SB 1145, 2006 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 199, amended Arizona's self-defense statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev.

In 2009, the legislature enacted SB 1449, providing that SB 1145 applied retroactively. The Supreme Court of Arizona held that SB 1449 was a valid exercise of legislative authority and did not violate the separation of powers doctrine in Ariz. Const. art. 3. SB 1449 did not disturb victims' rights in the finality of a defendant's conviction. Section 2 of SB 1449 was severable from and not fatal to SB 1449's operative provision in section 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, adjudicated defendant, a juvenile, delinquent for violating Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-507 (2009). The Arizona Court of Appeals held that when pure speech is involved, the statute applied only to &quot;fighting words.&quot; Defendant petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the court of appeals misapplied the fighting words doctrine by focusing on the theoretical reaction of a hypothetical reasonable person instead of the likely reaction of the teacher addressed by the speech. The supreme court noted that for purposes of the fighting words doctrine, the inquiry is not whether a reasonable person &quot;might&quot; react violently, but instead whether someone in the circumstances of the addressee would likely react violently in the context in which the words were spoken. Considering the circumstances in which defendant uttered his words, his insults would not likely have provoked an ordinary teacher to exchange fisticuffs with the student or otherwise react violently. Defendant's conduct, in vulgarly insulting the teacher, although reprehensible, was properly punished through school discipline or possibly prosecution under other statutes rather than by characterizing it as fighting words likely to provoke a violent reaction by his teacher.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a mistrial, a second jury of the Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, convicted defendant of murder, burglary, and kidnapping and returned a death verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Arizona Supreme Court held that the trial court did not err in declaring a mistrial after several jurors prematurely discussed the evidence. There was also no clear error in denying Batson challenges to the State's peremptory strikes of three minority jurors during selection of the second jury, because the State offered a race-neutral explanation for each strike: The State struck one juror for hardship, another for her negative feelings toward police, and the last for her criminal history. Further, other minority jurors were ultimately selected for the panel. Sufficient evidence supported a finding that the murder was &quot;especially cruel&quot; within the meaning of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-751(F)(6); the victim almost certainly was conscious when he was tightly bound hand and foot, a pillowcase was tied over his head, and he struggled to free himself, indicating that he had time to suffer significant uncertainty as to his fate. Impact testimony from the victim's parents was properly admitted, even if the statements were not admitted to rebut specific mitigating evidence. The parents spoke of the victim's character and played the 911 call the father made after finding his son murdered.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that the evidence supported the jurors' finding that the murder was especially cruel under Ariz. Rev.

Further, defendant told reporters during a post-arrest press conference that the victim struggled and that, hours after the drowning, he could still remember the victim looking at him as he was in the water; those facts supported a finding that the victim consciously experienced mental anguish before his death, and the jurors also could have reasonably inferred from this evidence that defendant knew that the victim would suffer. Therefore, sufficient evidence supported the jurors' finding that the murder was especially cruel. The mere fact that the victim was two years old and possibly did not comprehend that he was dying did not prevent the jury from finding that he consciously experienced mental anguish before his death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Maricopa County Superior Court (Arizona) that convicted him of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, burglary, misconduct involving weapons, and two counts of aggravated assault and that imposed a capital sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his brother broke into an apartment, robbed a couple, and were apprehended shortly thereafter. When their efforts to persuade the victims not to testify failed, they devised a plan to kill the victims. Thereafter, defendant broke into the victims' apartment a second time and shot both the husband and wife as they slept. The husband was killed, but the wife survived. Their infant son, who was in bed with his parents, was uninjured. On review, the court held that State proved the (F)(6) aggravator under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-751 (2010), which required a showing of heinousness or depravity, because the elimination of a witness to prior crime supported a finding of heinousness or depravity.  However, the (F)(3) aggravator--which required a showing that defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to the infant--was not established because it was dark in the apartment, and the evidence showed only that defendant saw the outlines of the adults' bodies and likely did not notice their infant son. Because the State did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew the baby was in the bed, the evidence was insufficient to establish the (F)(3) aggravator.</SPAN></P>

Further, the trial court did not err in permitting the State to introduce autopsy photographs into evidence because the photographs were relevant to prove the cause of death and the extent of the abuse and because each photograph illustrated a different aspect of the medical examiner's testimony; this evidence was also relevant to rebut defendant's argument that the victim seemed fine after the beating and his suggestion that she died because of a lack of prompt medical attention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that evidence of defendant's affiliation with the Imperial Royal Guard was relevant to establish a motive for the crimes and its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the prejudice it might have caused. Defendant did not satisfy his initial burden of establishing that the trial court committed any error in admitting this evidence. The trial court properly admitted defendant's statements to police officers and evidence of the campsite guns and ammunition. Defendant did not object to the armed robbery jury instruction and verdict forms and failed to demonstrate fundamental error. The evidence did not support a lesser-included offense instruction on simple robbery or false imprisonment. Defendant's burglary conviction was remanded for resentencing within the statutory range. The instructions given correctly stated the law. Defendant's right to have a reviewable record was sufficiently protected. The supreme court has rejected the claim that Arizona's method of execution by lethal injection automatically constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The aggravating factors, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-751(F)(5), (6), and (8) were properly found.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as to defendant's convictions and death sentences, and remanded for resentencing on the burglary conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with armed robbery and first degree murder. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the State to ask prospective jurors if they could consider imposing a death sentence if a defendant had not actually shot the victim. A juror was properly stricken after testifying that he was not positive he could vote for death. The State offered race-neutral explanations for striking a juror who could not read English. While the trial court ordered a mistrial of the aggravation phase after a juror disclosed misconduct, the trial court was not required to grant a mistrial for the already completed guilt phase. In reconsidering an earlier ruling, the second judge properly gave effect to Arizona law. Defendant was not entitled to bifurcate the death eligibility and aggravation issues. The trial court properly instructed the jurors that they could consider any relevant factor as mitigating. The Supreme Court of Arizona upheld the death sentence. Substantial evidence supported the jury's finding that defendant was a major participant in the underlying robbery, and he acted with reckless indifference to human life.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 10; Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 25. The supreme court noted that the change in the law permitting the state to retry the penalty phase when the first jury could not reach a decision neither added a new element to the crime of first degree murder nor increased the punishment for the crime. The prosecutor did not commit misconduct in his arguments regarding the Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-751(F)(6) cruelty aggravator because the comments did not dispute the essential elements of physical cruelty. Because the argument focused on considerations proper for the jury in light of the instruction defendant requested, the prosecutor did not commit misconduct. The facts established that the officer consciously suffered physical pain and defendant knew or should have known he would experience such pain. In light of the evidence, it was difficult to conclude that defendant's later remorse was genuine. The aggravators were entitled to substantial weight.</SPAN></P>

The State's evidence showed that defendant entered the victim's apartment uninvited and armed with a knife. The evidence supported the jury's finding that he entered the victim's apartment intending to commit aggravated assault, and was sufficient to support his conviction for first degree murder. Defendant was not entitled to a mistrial when the victim's stepmother cried audibly. The instructions appropriately informed the jury of the verdict and sentencing options. The trial court did not err by sending the jury back to deliberate after two separate impasse or deadlock notes. The jury did not abuse its discretion in finding that the State proved an aggravator under Ariz. Rev. Stat. 13-751(F)(6), because the murder was especially cruel. The Supreme Court of Arizona held that the jury did not abuse its discretion in determining that death was the appropriate sentence.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court accepted interlocutory review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1991, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a special order governing the approval of settlement agreements involving the claims of Indian tribes to use water in the Gila River system and source. In 2006, the settling parties applied for approval of the GRIC settlement agreement to allow GRIC to receive 653, 500 acre-feet of water per year. The adjudication court determined that the Apache Tribes had no viable objections, because the agreement did not affect their water rights. The limited scope of settlement review provided in the special order did not unfairly prevent the Tribe and other objectors them from challenging settlements. The adjudication court did not have an inherent duty to consider the constitutionality, legality, and fairness of the settlement agreement. The Apache Tribes' objection about water quality was outside the special order's scope of review. The lower Gila water users were not bound by the settlement or judgment, because they were not settling parties and did not sign the agreement. Their constitutional and statutory arguments were outside the scope of review. A contract claim also fell outside the scope of review allowed by the special order.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court concluded that defendant's wife's consent was valid because intervening circumstances obviated any alleged taint and the first dog sniff conducted from outside the garage was not flagrant police misconduct. The wife's consent was obtained within a few hours after the dog sniff took place. The wife's lack of knowledge of the dog sniff constituted a major break in the casual chain. Because the wife knew nothing of the dog sniff, no link between the alleged illegality and the consent was established. Thus, she was in the same posture as a person not previously subject to an illegal entry. The wife's consent was sufficiently attenuated from any alleged prior illegality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Arizona Senate and then the House of Representatives passed several appropriations bills regarding the budget. However, the Governor announced her opposition and her intent to partially veto the bills, and the Legislature declined to present them to her. The Governor filed her petition. It was noted that the court had previously ruled that pursuant to Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect; 12, the Legislature could not pass bills and then withhold them in order to prevent the Governor from exercising her power to approve or veto the legislation. The Legislature sought reconsideration, seeking delay of presentment for some &quot;reasonable time.&quot; The court initially determined that it had special action jurisdiction over the issue pursuant to Ariz. Const. art. 6, &sect; 5(1), that the Governor had standing, and that the matter was ripe for judicial resolution. It held that based on the language of &sect; 12, the Legislature was required to present passed bills to the Governor with no more delay than was reasonably necessary to complete any ministerial tasks and otherwise effect their orderly transmittal. However, mandamus relief was not warranted due to the lack of necessity in the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from the murder of his girlfriend and her two young children.

Stat. &sect; 13-1101(1) (1989) and case law and correctly distinguished between reflection and action. Further, the prosecutor's argument was not in error since case law specifically permitted prosecutors to argue circumstantial evidence of reflection. The court found no merit to defendant's contention that he was entitled to a jury instruction on his defense of intoxication as the defense of intoxication had been eliminated for any criminal act or requisite state of mind, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-503 (1989). The court upheld the trial court's determination that defendant failed to establish the mitigating factor of diminished capacity as the expert testimony, on balance, showed that he had a personality or character disorder, but did not show that he established diminished capacity. The court found no error with regard to any procedural of evidentiary aspect of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the structure and purpose of the Early Childhood Initiative, and specifically Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-1181, demonstrated that the phrase &quot;as otherwise provided by law&quot; in &sect; 8-1181(E) (2007) did not provide the legislature with authority to transfer interest and income from funds generated by the tobacco tax to the general fund. The Board had authority over the distribution of revenues and investment income. Read in the context of the other provisions of the Early Childhood Initiative, the final clause of &sect; 8-1181(E) was most logically read as providing the legislature only a limited power to credit interest and other income to a Fund account other than the account of origin. Once such income was credited, however, it was subject to &sect; 8-1181's comprehensive scheme. Allowing monies to be siphoned from the Fund to the general fund was not consistent with the purpose of the initiative. Rather, the purpose of the initiative was to ensure that revenues serve the specific program aims of the initiative. The transfer violated Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 1, &sect; 1(6)(D).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his half-brother committed burglary. After being arrested, defendant devised a plan to murder the victims to prevent them from testifying. On review of the capital sentence imposed following defendant's murder conviction, the court held that the State did not establish the (F)(3) aggravator because the evidence did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew that the murder plot would place the victims' infant in danger. While defendant knew that children lived in the apartment, he could not have known that one of the murders would take place in the parents' bedroom or that the couple's infant would be in bed with the father. As such, there was no showing that defendant knew that the child would be in the zone of danger. However, the (F)(2) aggravator was established because the murders were committed during a robbery, which was a serious offense, the (F)(6) aggravator was also established because the murders were perpetrated to eliminate witnesses, and the (F)(7) aggravator was established because the murders were committed while defendant was on parole from an armed robbery conviction and while released on bail on the burglary charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court in Maricopa County, Arizona, that convicted him of murder and imposed a death sentence, arguing that his conviction of felony murder was precluded by the merger doctrine, that the trial court impermissibly limited his voir dire, and that the trial court erred in precluding evidence of actual innocence at sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court rejected defendant's argument that, under the merger doctrine, felony murder could not be predicated upon a burglary that was itself based on the intent to murder because the felony murder statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1105(A)(2) (Supp. 1999), did not distinguish between burglaries defined by intent to commit assault versus intent to murder. It would be anomalous to conclude that first-degree murder occurs if a burglary with intent to assault results in death but not if the burglary is based on the more culpable intent to murder. Further, while defendant was afforded an opportunity during voir dire to identify and to strike for cause prospective jurors who would automatically impose the death penalty once guilt is found, he was not entitled to ask prospective jurors to identify circumstances they would find mitigating or to answer open-ended questions about their views on mitigation. Further, the court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in precluding evidence of actual innocence because the trial court was not constitutionally or statutorily required to admit evidence or permit argument regarding residual doubt at a sentencing trial.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed, finding first that the evidence supported a finding that he intended to participate in inflicting injury on the victim, including testimony from his ex-wife that he went with some friends to beat up somebody. As defendant's theory of the case denied all involvement in the killing, and no evidence provided a basis for a second degree murder conviction, the lesser-included offense instruction was properly refused. The evidence also showed that defendant was a major participant in the crime, including that he was armed with a knife and encircled the victim to prevent him from leaving as his codefendant administered a savage beating. Defendant also helped dump the body and cut off the victim's finger after the beating. The evidence showed that the murder was especially cruel and heinous or depraved, that defendant was not a minor participant, and supported the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after police found the body of his girlfriend in the car he was driving.

P. 13.5(c) could include a challenge to the factual underpinnings of a capital aggravator but that defendant had not carried his burden of proving that probable cause did not exist. After the trial court denied defendant's motion for reconsideration, defendant petitioned for a special action. On review, the court held that Ariz. R. Crim. P. 13.5(c) allowed a defendant in a capital case to request a probable cause determination for alleged aggravating circumstances. Such determinations were to be made following the procedure in Ariz.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Maricopa County Superior Court, Arizona, concluded that appellant Arizona's Independent Redistricting Commission (Commission) failed to favor the creation of competitive legislative districts and that this failure was arbitrary and capricious and a violation of Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect; 1(14)(F). The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed. Appellees, coalition and others, petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the Commission acted as a legislative body. The supreme court had to determine whether the Commission followed the constitutionally required procedure in adopting its final redistricting plan.

The Commission followed the mandatory constitutional procedure by attempting to accommodate the competitiveness goal, while taking into account whether greater competitiveness would cause significant detriment to the other goals. The multi-step approach the Commission followed, which allowed public comment on more than one draft map, did not violate any constitutionally mandated procedure. The coalition did not meet its burden of establishing that the plan lacked a reasonable basis. The fact that a &quot;better&quot; plan existed did not establish that the Commission's plan lacked a reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find the existence of the F.8 aggravating factor--that defendant committed multiple murders during the commission of the offense--under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-751 (Supp. 2008) beyond a reasonable doubt. The State proved that the homicides were temporarily, spatially, and motivationally related and took place during a continuous course of criminal conduct. The victims were killed in close proximity to one another. All died in the same room of the apartment in which one of the victims lived and had been seated near one another; this satisfied the spatial relationship requirement. Similarly, the evidence showed that all victims were killed within moments of one another where defendant's girlfriend testified that, immediately after the murders, defendant came to her apartment and told her that he shot and killed the victims in quick succession; this satisfied the temporal relationship requirement. Finally, the State established the motivational requirement through evidence that defendant went to the apartment intending to kill one of the victims and that he killed the others because they witnessed the murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Maricopa Superior Court, Arizona, dismissed appellants', resident and others, complaint seeking to enjoin implementation of the school voucher programs against appellees, school superintendent and intervenors.

The supreme court found that the text and purpose of the Aid Clause supported the conclusion that the clause required a construction independent from that of the Religion Clause, Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 12. The Aid Clause encompassed more than did the Religion Clause. The Aid Clause was designed to protect the public fisc and to protect public schools. Both clauses prohibited certain appropriations of public money. The voucher programs transferred state funds directly from the state treasury to private schools. The Aid Clause did not permit the appropriations the voucher programs provided as it would amount to aid of private or sectarian schools, Ariz.

The company separately filed a counterclaim. The superior court held a reservation invalid and entered judgment for the trustee. Defendants appealed, and the Arizona Court of Appeals vacated the trial court's judgment. Review was accepted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation bought certain land from a ranch. The deed reserved all mineral rights and commercial water rights but did not otherwise retain any ownership interest in the land. The corporation conveyed the property to the trustee. One-half interest in the commercial water rights for the ranch was conveyed to the company. The trustee granted the city an option to purchase the ranch and an adjacent ranch, but the trustee was unable to purchase the water rights from the company. The case involved the potential use of groundwater that had never been captured and put to reasonable use. The Groundwater Management Act (GMA), Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 45-401 to -704 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2008) regulated any withdrawal and transportation of groundwater from the ranch to the city. The GMA did not recognize the existence of anything called a commercial water right. The company and its predecessors had not identified any pre-existing or current use of the groundwater underlying the ranch that was embraced by the reservation of commercial water rights. Moreover, the cases cited by the intermediate appellate court did not establish a severable right to the potential future use of groundwater.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The anesthesiologist filed a motion contending that the patient's expert witness, a retired anesthesiologist, did not meet the requirement of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2604(A) that an expert on the standard of care must have devoted a majority of his professional time in the year preceding the incident at issue to active clinical practice or teaching in the same specialty. The trial court agreed that the witness was unqualified and, when the patient failed to produce a qualified expert, dismissed the case. The appellate court reversed and held that &sect; 12-2604(A) directly conflicted with Ariz. R. Evid. 702 by excluding experts qualified to testify under the rule and violated the separation of powers doctrine under Ariz. Const. art. 3 by fringing upon judicial authority to promulgate procedural rules. On review, the court concluded that the statute did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because, although it conflicted with Ariz. R. Evid. 702, the statute was substantive. It did not merely alter procedure but changed the substantive law as to what a plaintiff must prove in a medical malpractice action. However, the superior court erred in retroactively applying the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor argued the by waiting to bring its action until November, the organization prevented prompt judicial resolution of the matter and exacerbated the already precarious budget situation. The supreme court found that the organization did not wait until an imminent deadline approached to file its special action. The delay in the case did not cause prejudice. The question remained whether &sect; 47 identified and reduced something that met the definition of appropriation under Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect; 20. The supreme court found that it did not. The legislature did not expressly attach the assessed amount to any public revenue that it had previously set aside for the cities and towns. Because &sect; 47 of 2008 Ariz. Sess. Laws 285 failed to identify any prior appropriation, it failed to meet the definition of an appropriation. Because &sect; 47 did not reduce any identified prior appropriation, it violated Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect; 20, and was therefore unconstitutional. The organization could not be awarded attorneys' fees under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-348(A) (2003).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were charged with violating Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1422 (2005), which prohibited adult bookstores from remaining open during certain early morning hours. The trial court dismissed the charges. The Arizona Court of Appeals, Division One, reversed. Review was granted to resolve a conflict between the opinion in Empress Adult Video &amp; Bookstore v. City of Tucson and the appellate court's opinion in this case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute required adult bookstores to close for 53 hours each week: from 1:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. Monday through Saturday, and from 1:00 a.m. to noon on Sunday. The instant court concluded that petitioners established that their protected speech was burdened by a content-based regulation. The State, in turn, met its burden of demonstrating that the hours provision of &sect; 13-1422 was designed to curb the secondary effects of speech, not to prohibit the speech itself. The State was required to establish that, during their early morning operation, adult bookstores disproportionately caused negative secondary effects and that these negative effects were or would be significantly lessened by closure during those hours. However, the State did not show that any substantial interests would be achieved less effectively without the bookstores' closure for 53 hours each week. Because this case was decided on motion to dismiss, the record contained no evidence of the significance of the infringement on speech, the effectiveness of the statute in reducing negative secondary effects, the nexus between the ends sought and the means employed, or the availability of alternative measures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Maricopa Superior Court, Arizona, revoked defendant's probation on his attempted sexual abuse count and instead of the presumptive sentence of ten years, the trial court imposed an aggravated sentence of 12.5 years. Defendant's petition for post-conviction relief was denied. The Arizona Court of Appeals denied review. Defendant petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that when defendant committed his offenses, the relevant statute provided that a defendant's sentence could be increased based on twelve specific aggravating factors, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-702(D)(1)-(12) (Supp. 1991). In addition to the twelve listed aggravating factors, the statute included a &quot;catch-all&quot; provision. The supreme court found that the use of the catch-all as the sole factor to increase a defendant's statutory maximum sentence violated due process, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because it gave the sentencing court virtually unlimited post hoc discretion to determine whether the defendant's prior conduct was the functional equivalent of an element of the aggravated offense. When one or more clearly enumerated aggravators were found consistent with Apprendi, and they allowed imposition of an aggravated sentence under the relevant statute, the &quot;elements&quot; of the aggravated offense would have been identified with sufficient clarity to satisfy due process. Subsequent reliance on other factors embraced by a catch-all provision to justify a sentence up to the statutory maximum comported with the traditional discretionary role afforded judges in sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was vacated and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his sister burglarized a home in Texas.

After the friend informed defendant of his sister's plans, defendant and the friend killed defendant's sister and her finance. Defendant was convicted of both murders and sentenced to death. After his original sentence was vacated, defendant was again sentenced to death after the jury found the multiple murders aggravating factor under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(8). On review, the court held that the multiple murders aggravating circumstance was proper where defendant killed his sister and her fiance in order to prevent the sister from returning to Oklahoma and disclosing his involvement in another crime. Although defendant claimed that he killed the fiance because he hated him, such motivation was inextricably intertwined with his motivation for killing his sister, which was his desire not to be pursued by Oklahoma authorities.</SPAN></P>

The State's efforts to rebut defendant's mitigation evidence during the penalty phase did not violate defendant's rights under the Confrontation Clause because the victim impact evidence defendant objected to was not put on by the State, cross-examination was not permitted, and placing the victim's mother under oath was not necessary. The jury did not abuse its discretion by finding the Ariz. Rev.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to strike jurors who had friends in law enforcement; the jurors stated that they could fairly evaluate the evidence. The fact that defendant was required to use a peremptory challenge to strike a juror did not violate the Sixth Amendment. Requiring defendant to wear a shock belt during the proceedings did not deprive him of a fair trial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting a photograph of the officer's head wound. The jury's finding of the Ariz. Rev.

The supreme court disagreed. The evidence allowed the jury to find the pecuniary gain aggravator beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant's confession clearly indicated his monetary motivation: defendant told a detective that money was his motivation. Moreover, the evidence demonstrated that money was taken from two registers and one victim's bank card was used in an attempt to withdraw money from an ATM. Defendant admitted that the victims were forced at gunpoint to lie down in the work area of the restaurant, ordered to remove everything from their pockets, ordered to march through the cooler into the back freezer with their hands interlaced on top of their heads, forced to kneel down, and then shot in rapid succession. All the murders involved a continuous course of criminal conduct. The evidence, including defendant's admissions, demonstrated that the victims were killed, at least in part, as a means of witness elimination so that they could not identify the perpetrators.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting the DNA evidence because the State did not establish a sufficient chain of custody to authenticate the evidence. The supreme court found that defendant did not show any tampering with the evidence. A sexual assault involved use or exhibition of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument within the meaning of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604(G) was necessarily one that involved the use or threat of violence. The trial court did not err in instructing the jury as to the Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(2) aggravator. The Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(6) aggravator was not vague. The manner of execution would be determined as provided in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-704(B). The aggravating circumstances of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(2) and (6) were proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant presented no evidence casually relating his childhood to his attack on the victim. His evidence of an undiagnosed mental illness was entitled to little mitigating weight. There was no evidence he was using drugs at the time. The mitigation evidence was insubstantial and did not warrant leniency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) found defendant guilty of the victim's murder and determined that he should be sentenced to death. He appealed. Eventually, the United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the supreme court, which remanded it to the trial court for resentencing. After the resentencing proceeding, the trial court again sentenced him to death by lethal injection. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because a suspect was still a target of the State's investigation, he demonstrated a reasonable ground to apprehend danger to himself from his being compelled to answer under the Sixth Amendment. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excusing him from testifying because he legitimately invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination on the questions proffered by defendant. Also, defendant did not have a constitutional or statutory right to present residual doubt evidence at his resentencing proceeding, including the results of a polygraph examination and assertions of innocence during allocution. Furthermore, overwhelming evidence supported the Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(5) (Supp. 1988) aggravating factor that the motivation for the murder was financial gain. In light of the compelling aggravating circumstance, the mitigation evidence that included family support; the divorce of his parents, his father's alcoholism, and his father's mental abuse; and his good character, which deserved less weight in a case involving a murder planned in advance, failed to rise to a level that would call for leniency. Thus, the death sentence was properly imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court modified defendant's sentence to permit him to choose execution either by lethal injection or lethal gas; as modified, the supreme court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of drive-by shooting, aggravated assault of passengers in the car, and two other counts. The trial court aggravated defendant's sentences and imposed sentences totaling thirty-one years. The Court of Appeals, Division One, Arizona, affirmed the sentence but relied on a different rationale than the trial court. The instant court accepted review to determine whether the sentence was aggravated in violation of Apprendi.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury did not find and defendant did not admit any of the aggravating factors that subjected him to a sentence above the statutory presumptive sentence. The instant court found that the trial court erred when it increased defendant's sentence based on the judge's findings that defendant had committed an unrelated homicide and was a danger to the community. The trial court's comment that defendant had a juvenile record was not a finding that juvenile adjudications should serve as an aggravating factor. A reviewing court should not assume the role of a sentencing judge and seek out new aggravating circumstances, not found below, to save the constitutionally flawed sentence. The trial court denied defendant the right to have certain facts decided by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Because this unconstitutional procedure went to the foundation of defendant's case, there was fundamental error. Finally, defendant established prejudicial error because the instant court was not convinced that a reasonable jury would have necessarily concluded that he committed the homicide or was a danger to the community.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed. The opinion of the court of appeals was vacated in part. The sentence was vacated. The matter was remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurer, as a subrogee, brought suit alleging that defendant manufacturer or defendant distributing company was strictly liable in tort for distributing a defective product. The distributing company failed to respond to the complaint, and a default judgment was entered. The superior court denied the insurer's motion to find joint and several liability. The Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed. The insurer sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured discovered that a leak in his water filtration system had damaged his home and personal property. The insurer paid the homeowner for the loss. The insurer and the manufacturer entered into a stipulated judgment, which stated that the leak had been caused by either a design or manufacturing defect. The judgment provided that the distributing company was 75 percent at fault, and the manufacturer was 25 percent at fault. The distributing company had gone out of business; therefore, the insurer could recover only 25 percent of the damages. The case required the supreme court to decide whether liability among defendants in strict products liability actions was joint and several, or several only. The supreme court concluded that the legislature abolished, with its amendment in 1987 of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2506, joint and several liability for participants in a defective product's chain of distribution  Further, this statute did not offend Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6. The legislative abolition of joint and several liability extended to strict products liability actions. In such cases, liability was several only and fault had to be apportioned among defendants.</SPAN></P>

The superior court ended the marriage by entering a decree that included the parties' settlement agreement. Appellant husband later sought, pursuant to Ariz. R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decree required the husband to pay child support, attorneys' fees, and spousal maintenance. The husband failed to fulfill some of his obligations. The husband was declared disabled. Subsequently, the husband moved under Ariz. R. Civ. P. 60(c) to set aside provisions of the decree, alleging that his support and maintenance obligations were excessive in light of his reduced income. In vacating the trial court's decision, the intermediate appellate court had determined that the husband was entitled to an evidentiary hearing. At issue on review was whether a statutorily non-modifiable spousal maintenance provision in a decree of dissolution of marriage was subject to termination under Ariz. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(5). The husband claimed that despite any statute purporting to divest jurisdiction to modify or terminate the maintenance provision, a court nonetheless retained equitable power to grant relief by terminating the maintenance provision at issue. The spousal maintenance agreements made non-modifiable pursuant to Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a water rights dispute, the Pascua Yaqui Tribe filed objections to a settlement agreement among the various parties, including the Tohono O'odham Nation. The adjudication court summarily disposed of the objections. The Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) denied the Tribe's motion for reconsideration. Following the adjudication court's rejection of the Tribe's objections, the settling parties and the Tribe sought interlocutory review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose from the ongoing adjudication of water rights and the impact of legislation facilitating the resolution of tribal water claims. A Special Procedural Order providing for the Approval of Federal Water Rights Settlements, Including Those of Indian Tribes (Special Order) was previously entered, establishing circumstances under which special settlement proceedings could be initiated; it set forth the process by which parties could apply to initiate special proceedings; it allowed the parties to object to court approval of the settlement; and it provided for resolution of objections and approval of the settlement adjudication by the court. The Tribe asked that the Special Order be found invalid insofar as it limited the adjudication court's obligation to consider objections that did not turn on the settlement agreement itself. The supreme court, however, determined that none of the Tribe's issues had merit because the settlement determined only the water rights of the Nation; it did not provide the Nation with any federal reserved rights; it restricted the amounts of groundwater the Nation could pump; and it expressly reserved all rights and claims of the Tribe.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court accepted interlocutory review, and it affirmed the judgment and decree of the adjudication court in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff students sued defendant State and Board of Regents, alleging that a tuition increase violated Ariz. Const. art. XI, &sect; 6. The Court of Appeals of Arizona, Division One, reversed the superior court's judgment dismissing the claim, holding that Ariz. Rev. Stat. 12-820.01(A) did not immunize the Board from suit and that the students' complaint stated a claim upon which relief could be granted. The Board's petition for review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue what whether there were judicially discoverable and manageable standards for determining when tuition was constitutionally excessive. The constitutional language did not provide a standards as case law interpreting Ariz. Const. art. XI, &sect; 6 provided no guidance on how to measure whether tuition at some level above zero was &quot;as nearly free as possible.&quot; Although the legislature had provided guidance in past statutory enactments, no current statutes provided standards by which a court could have measured whether tuition was too high. The Ariz. Rev. Stat. 15-1626(A)(13) requirement that the Board adopt an annual operating budget provided no guidance as to an appropriate operating budget or the proportions to be satisfied by tuition. Rather, the ultimate size of the budget was left to the Board's discretion. The court could not assess whether the cost of tuition was as nearly free as possible in the absence of an initial policy determination of a kind clearly reserved to the Legislature and the Board. Since there were no judicially discoverable and manageable standards, the funding decisions by the other branches of government were insulated from judicial review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's opinion was vacated insofar as it held that the complaint against the Board should not have been dismissed. The superior court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The jury found the existence of three aggravating factors in former Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(G)(2), (6), (9) (Supp. 2001): a previous conviction for a serious offense, especial cruelty, and the victim's being under 15 years of age.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant physically abused his girlfriend's 3-year-old and 20-month old daughters, inflicting skull fractures and causing the death of the younger child, whose body he weighted with a cement block and dropped into a canal. Conducting an independent review, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excusing for cause six venire persons who were biased in favor of the death penalty or by empaneling two others who were equivocal. In the aggravation phase, the jury was presumed to rely on the trial court's instructions not to use the victim's age as a basis for two separate aggravators. A &quot;previously convicted of a serious offense&quot; aggravator was properly imposed under former Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(G)(2) because defendant confessed to abusing the surviving sister separately from killing the younger sister. The trial court's penalty phase jury instructions did not mischaracterize the sentencing decisionmaking process or restrict the use of mitigation evidence. Although the prosecutor improperly inpugned a defense mental health expert's anticipated testimony, defendant was not prejudiced because the expert never testified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

The Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(6) aggravating factor was not unconstitutional or overly broad as judicial opinions had narrowed its construction and the trial court's jury instructions sufficiently defined heinous and depraved. Photographs of the victim's body, a Confederate flag found in appellant's van, and appellant's tattoos were properly admitted to prove the &sect; 13-703(F)(6) aggravating factor as they were relevant and not unduly prejudicial. The State did not improperly limit the type of mitigation evidence the jury could consider in the penalty phase as it merely suggested that the mitigation evidence was entitled to minimal weight and any potential error was cured by the jury instructions. The remaining claims also failed.</SPAN></P>

The prosecutor's comments during the State's voir dire simply described the role of the prosecutor in jury selection. It was not fundamental error to allow the State to inquire if jurors would follow the law. The superior court had cured any error arising from an initial time limit for voir dire. The claims as to three jurors lacked merit where they had stated that their opinion of the death penalty depended on the circumstances. Appellant had waived any Batson claims by failing to challenge the State's peremptory strikes and failed to show that the empanelled jury was not impartial. The State had not improperly withheld exculpatory evidence where there was no showing that any sheriff's office records were withheld and a state agency was not involved in the investigation of the murders. Admission of jailhouse telephone conversation was proper as it was probative of appellant's consciousness of guilt and was a party admission under Ariz. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A).

Defendant's absence during the jury commissioner's prescreening of prospective jurors to determine whether they could serve on a lengthy trial did not violate defendant's right to be present at all stages of the criminal proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2004, in the Maricopa County Superior Court (Arizona), defendant was resentenced to death for two murders committed in 1975 and 1976. An automatic notice of appeal was filed under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 26.15 and 31.2(b) and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4031 (2001). The supreme court had jurisdiction under Ariz. Const. art. 6, &sect; 5(3), and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4031.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims died of asphyxiation after having their noses and mouths filled with dirt and taped shut. That type of asphyxiation would undoubtedly cause mental anguish and physical pain. At a minimum, defendant should have known pain and anguish would occur. Thus, the State proved that the murders were cruel under former Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-454(E)(6). Also, the State proved the existence of two other aggravating factors, including that he was convicted of another offense that carried a sentence of life imprisonment or death and that his prior convictions involved the use or threat of violence under former Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-454(E)(1), (2). The focus of defendant's mitigation evidence related to his mental health. But, the role of his mental health in the commission of the murders, and thus the quality of the mitigation was called into serious question by testimony that he could have controlled his impulses and that he likely knew what he was doing and that it was wrong. After reviewing the record, under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703.04(B), the mitigation presented was not sufficiently substantial to warrant leniency given the nature of the crimes and the aggravating factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court vacated the lethal injection portion of defendant's sentences and ordered that defendant be permitted to choose either lethal injection or lethal gas, as long as he did so at least 20 days before the execution date. If defendant failed to choose, the death penalty would be carried out by lethal injection. As modified, the supreme court affirmed defendant's death sentences.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge sentenced defendant to death for each of the murders. The supreme court reversed the sentence and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of sexual assault and sentenced to 25 years to life imprisonment. Thus, the aggravator under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(1) was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Also, the supreme court found in its independent review that the first victim was conscious when she was bound and strangled. Furthermore, her injuries indicated that she suffered extreme physical pain when she was bludgeoned, sexually assaulted, and strangled. Accordingly, the State established beyond a reasonable doubt that her murder was especially cruel under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(6) (Supp. 1999). In addition, the record demonstrated that all three murders occurred on the same day and in the same apartment. Thus, the State proved the multiple murders aggravator in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(8) (Supp 1999) beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, defendant's narcissistic personality disorder did not rise to the level of a statutory mitigating circumstance. Thus, defendant's mitigation evidence of his young age and his lack of a prior criminal record was not sufficiently substantial to warrant leniency in light of the aggravating factors. Thus, defendant's death sentences were upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a special action pursuant to Ariz. R.P. Spec. Actions 1, petitioners, the 47th Legislature, the State Senate President, and Speaker of the House of Representatives, challenged the validity of respondent Governor's item veto of a portion of H.B. 2661, &sect; 5, 47th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2006), that adopted a substantive change to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-771 (2004) by adding a new class of employees to those exempt from the state merit system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Legislature passed H.B. 2661 as an emergency measure in order to grant state employees a pay raise under H.B. 2661, &sect; 1, and appropriated money for the employee salary adjustments under H.B. 2661, &sect; 6.  H.B. 2661, &sect; 5 amended Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-771 and exempted certain employees from the state merit system. The Governor item vetoed a portion of H.B. 2661, &sect; 5. The Legislature challenged the validity of the veto, arguing that H.B. 2661, &sect; 5 was not an &quot;item of appropriation of money&quot;; thus the Governor's item veto power under Ariz. Const. art. V, &sect; 7 did not extend to H.B. 2661, &sect; 5. The court held that it had jurisdiction because the issues presented were purely legal issues of public importance, likely to recur, and not political questions. The court also found that the Legislature had standing because it had alleged a direct institutional injury. The court concluded that H.B. 2661, &sect; 5 was not an &quot;item of appropriation of money&quot; within the governor's veto power in Ariz. Const. art V, &sect; 7 because H.B. 2661, &sect; 5 failed to set aside a certain sum of public revenue from the general fund or from some other specific limited funding source; thus the Governor's veto was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that because H.B. 2661, &sect; 5, was not an appropriation, the Governor's item veto of that provision exceeded her constitutional authority and was invalid. Accordingly, the court ordered that H.B. 2661, &sect; 5 be given full force and effect.</SPAN></P>

One of those victims was pregnant, and as a result of her death her fetus also died. On appeal, the court held that defendant's Eighth Amendment rights were not violated as the jury for the guilt phase was death-qualified, even though the jury was allegedly incorrectly instructed that it would not decide aggravating factors or sentencing, because the guilt-phase jury played no role in sentencing, as a second sentencing-phase jury was selected, and therefore the guilt-phase jury could not have been misled into thinking that responsibility for the determination of the proper sentence lay elsewhere. The trial court did not err by admitting into evidence photographs of the victims because they showed the nature and placement of the victims' injuries and therefore were relevant to corroborate the testimony of the State's witnesses. Photographs of the fetus were relevant to both the manslaughter offense and the multiple homicides aggravator. Defendant's argument that the fetal manslaughter statute,&nbsp;&sect; 13-1103(A)(5), applied only in cases in which the mother did not die was rejected.</SPAN></P>

The record showed that defendant poured gasoline on the victims and set them on fire because he was angry about their accusations about a stolen shotgun. The court held that defendant's conviction for endangerment was supported by sufficient evidence that showed he was aware that other people were in the small apartment building, and thus was aware of and disregarded a substantial risk that his actions would place others at risk of imminent death or physical injury. The court held the cruelty aggravator was supported by evidence that showed defendant included styrofoam in the gas so that it would stick to the victims and cause greater pain. The court found that defendant's sentence for endangerment and the use of the same conduct to establish his eligibility for the death penalty under the aggravator in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703.F.3 did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because each offense contained an element not contained in the other, thus they were 2 separate offenses.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that defendant's right to counsel during his interrogation was not violated because defendant's statement &quot;I think I might want an attorney&quot; was an equivocal request for counsel and therefore the detectives were not required to stop questioning him. There was no basis to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by determining that defendant's statements were voluntary because the detective testified that no express or implied promises of leniency were made, it did not appear that defendant's will was overborne by any promises of leniency, defendant maintained that his accomplice was the ringleader and that he acted only under duress, and he admitted being familiar with and understood his Miranda rights. Defendant's argument that the trial court judge was improperly biased was rejected because defense counsel failed to make a motion under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 10.1. The court further held that the aggravating circumstances that the jury found warranted a death sentence were supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial could ruled that appellant failed to satisfy his burden of proving mental retardation by clear and convincing evidence. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the application of Ariz.

In comparing the gravity of defendant's crime and the severity of the punishment, the supreme court focused on whether a 10-year sentence was disproportionate for a conviction of possessing child pornography involving children younger than fifteen. The supreme court could not conclude that the sentence was grossly disproportionate. The 10-year sentence imposed for each offense was consistent with the State's penological goal of deterring the production and possession of child pornography. The supreme court also did not accept defendant's assertion that his crimes were victimless merely because he did not touch or even photograph any children himself. The supreme court noted the production of the images defendant possessed required the abuse of children.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed the trial court erred by failing to sever Count 2, the gang offense, from the other crimes charged, and he challenged the aggravating factors and the jury instructions as to those factors. The court held that the trial court did not err by refusing to sever Count 2 because the evidence of gang affiliation was admissible to establish motive and identity for defendant's other crimes and the trial court took appropriate steps to reduce any prejudice that could have resulted from joinder. The court found that strong and uncontroverted evidence supported witness elimination as a motive for the victim's murder and that the fact that the victim was a witness to a crime other than the murder established the heinous and depraved aggravating factor under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703.F(6).

The record made plain that defendant expressly preserved his jury trial claim; at the status conference, defense counsel explicitly told the trial court that defendant was not waiving any such right. During the plea colloquy, defendant did not agree to judicial factfinding concerning the aggravating factors and did not necessarily admit those facts by pleading guilty to an offense of which they were elements; therefore, his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial remained intact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for possession of marijuana and methamphetamine. She stipulated to having been previously indicted for manslaughter, but the indictment was dismissed. The trial court ruled that she was ineligible for probation, pursuant to Proposition 200, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-901.01 (2002). The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed the ruling. The State petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's manslaughter indictment was 10 years old. After defendant was deemed ineligible for probation because manslaughter was considered a violent crime, defendant faced a mandatory prison sentence because she committed the current offense while on parole. The issue presented was whether a 10-year-old, dismissed indictment disqualified a defendant from mandatory probation under Proposition 200. The supreme court held that a dismissed indictment, like a reversed conviction, did not disqualify a defendant from mandatory probation. Such a conviction typically would result in probation under Proposition 200. The State conceded that if a defendant were charged by information and convicted of a violent crime, and if the conviction were reversed later, it could not be used later to disqualify the defendant from probation under Proposition 200. The supreme court determined that imprisonment would not have served the purposes of Proposition 200, which was to provide treatment for drug offenders and to free prison space. The State's interpretation would have led to absurd results and constitutional concerns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury, before the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, of kidnapping, sexual assault, and first degree murder. Defendant received a death sentence for first degree murder, and an automatic notice of appeal was filed pursuant to Ariz. R. Crim. P. 31.2(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lived across an apartment landing from the victim. Screams were heard, and a neighbor called 911, but when police arrived, they could not find where the screams were coming from, so they left. When defendant's girlfriend came home, she found blood in the apartment. The victim's body was eventually found inside a garbage bin. An examination of semen found inside the victim's body matched defendant's DNA. On appeal, defendant argued that the superior court erred in its premeditation instruction. The supreme court noted, however, that defendant presented a defense of total innocence; therefore, any error was not fundamental. Because the jury found defendant guilty of the highest offense, the rule that required instruction on lesser included offenses was not implicated. Defendant also claimed that the superior court violated his right to an impartial jury at sentencing by imposing an aggravated sentence. The supreme court noted that the aggravated factors were not found by the jury or admitted by defendant. The supreme court found fundamental error. Finally, defendant was shackled during the penalty phase; the State failed to prove that this error was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed defendant's convictions for first degree murder, sexual assault, and kidnapping, and the aggravated sentence for sexual assault. The supreme court vacated the sentence of death for first degree murder and the aggravated sentence for kidnapping, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the District of Arizona granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, superior court judges, on plaintiff arbitrator's complaint attacking the arbitration program on both constitutional and state law grounds. The Ninth Circuit certified a question to the Arizona Supreme Court asking whether Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-133 authorized a system of compulsory participation of attorneys in the arbitration system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After accepting jurisdiction of the certified question, all justices named in the complaint recused themselves. The arbitrator argued that the participation of the permanent members of the supreme court was prohibited by Ariz. Code Jud. Conduct Canon 3(E)(1)(d)(i) and 3(E)(1)(a). The supreme court noted that it was the court of last resort on the interpretation of the authority to regulate the practice of law. The rule of necessity obliged the supreme court to sit in answering the questions certified in the case even though its members were nominal parties to the action. If any Arizona court would be incapable of answering the certified question without bias, it would not be possible, by appointing temporary replacements, to cure the basis of the arbitrator's objection. The arbitrator's allegation that the four permanent justices already had a view about the question certified did not constitute a basis for disqualification even if it could be established. A complaint to the Commission on Judicial Conduct did not alone merit disqualification. Even when the canons did not require recusal, a judge could recuse from judicial duties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arbitrator's motion to disqualify was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals determined that the plaza was a public forum and that Yavapai County, Ariz., Ordinance 2000-4 &sect; 104(B) was a time, place and manner restriction. The court of appeals found that the ordinance was neither significantly related to the county's purpose nor narrowly tailored to achieve it. The supreme court noted that to establish standing, it required that petitioners show a particularized injury to themselves. The citizen could not have suffered personal harm from the non-profit requirement of the ordinance as the fraternal order of police application was not rejected on that ground. It was rejected because sponsorship by a volunteer fire department, a long-time backer of the festival, was preferable. The citizen was not a sponsor. The city partnership simply made its choice between two non-profit organizations. That choice could not be said to have caused First Amendment damage to the citizen. She could not establish standing to assert her claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his request for new counsel and in imposing his sentences and that the especially heinous, cruel, and depraved aggravator, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(6), was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that defendant was not entitled to new counsel based on mere personality conflicts or disagreements over trial strategy as they did not constitute irreconcilable conflicts. The court noted that defendant's right to counsel did not include counsel of his choice. The court rejected defendant's claim that &sect; 13-703(F)(6) was unconstitutionally vague because the jury instructions given narrowed and defined the terms of especially heinous, cruel, and depraved as required by the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments. The court noted that &sect; 13-703(F)(6) was stated in the disjunctive; thus the jury's finding of cruelty was sufficient without addressing heinousness or depravity. The court held that the death penalty was properly imposed on the murder conviction because the jury found two uncontested capital aggravators in that the murder was committed in an especially cruel manner and the victim was less that 15 years old.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed all of defendant's convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an earlier opinion, defendant's convictions for conspiracy to commit first degree murder, armed robbery, and first degree murder were affirmed. The sentences of death and the sentence of life imprisonment were also affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court did not identify the statute under which the sentence was imposed; it appeared that the trial judge intended to impose the maximum super-aggravated sentence under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-702.01(A) (Supp. 1995). Defendant was eligible, however, for sentencing under the more punitive provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-702.01(C) (Supp. 1995) because he had a prior conviction. Defendant claimed that his right to a jury at sentencing was violated. The appellate court noted that jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder. The verdicts established beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of a serious physical injury aggravator. Also, the jury concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that each of the murders was motivated by pecuniary gain. Although the jury did not make a separate finding with respect to the motivation for the armed robbery, no reasonable jury could have failed to find the pecuniary gain aggravator for that offense. The failure of the superior court to submit to the jury the issue of motivation for the armed robbery was at worst harmless error.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, the trial court conducted individual voir dire of every prospective juror whose responses to the questionnaire suggested an inability to deliberate impartially or a predisposition to impose the death penalty regardless of the mitigation evidence. Those potential jurors were either rehabilitated or dismissed. Defendant did not identify a single juror who deliberated notwithstanding an unwillingness to consider mitigation evidence.

The first employee's post-accident urine test showed positive results for marijuana, amphetamine, and methamphetamine. The second employee's blood tests taken at the hospital shortly after the accident revealed alcohol in his blood. The issue in these consolidated matters required the court to determine whether Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 8, precluded the Arizona Legislature from requiring proof that the presence of alcohol or illegal drugs in an injured worker's system was not a contributing cause of the accident before workers' compensation benefits could be awarded. The court ruled that while alcohol consumption and illegal drug use shortly before work or during work undeniably increased the chances of being injured on the job, it could not be unequivocally said that employees with alcohol or drugs in their systems who sustained injuries had intentionally injured themselves.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder. The trial judge subsequently determined that a jury was necessary to find the existence of aggravating circumstance before a sentence of &quot;natural life&quot; could be imposed. The State sought special action review. The Arizona Court of Appeals held that the Blakely decision was inapplicable to the non-capital, first-degree murder scheme. The parties cross-petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted in 2000 for sexual assault and murder. Defendant argued that a life term was the presumptive sentence, and a natural life term would be an aggravated sentence. The supreme court was called on in this case to decide: (1) whether the Sixth Amendment required that a jury find specific aggravating circumstances before the superior court could impose a natural life sentence; and (2) whether the superior court could apply a law adopted in 2003 in deciding between a life and a natural life sentence for a first degree murder committed in 2000. The supreme court concluded that the Sixth Amendment did not require that a jury find an aggravating circumstance before a natural life sentence could be imposed. The remaining question was what factors the judge could consider in exercising his discretion to sentence a defendant to either life or natural life. The supreme court concluded that the legislature's enactment of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703.01(Q) (Supp. 2004) was substantive, not procedural; therefore, this statute could not be applied retroactively. The supreme court's Viramontes decision was still applicable to cases arising before the effective date of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court remanded the special action, and it affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

On appeal of the appellate court's order denying the newspaper publisher's motion to dismiss, the court reversed, holding that because the letter did not fall within one of the well-recognized narrow exceptions to the general rule of First Amendment protection for political speech, the newspaper publisher could not be held liable under Arizona tort law for publishing the letter. The letter did not fall under the &quot;incitement&quot; exception because it did not advocate imminent lawless action, because the suggestions that Muslims be executed was premised on the occurrence of some future assassination or another atrocity. The letter did not fall under the &quot;fighting words&quot; exception because the statements were not made in a face-to-face confrontation with the target of the remarks.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a drug run, defendant killed his traveling companion so that he could steal the marijuana he was transporting and sell the drugs for himself. Although the State notified defendant that it would seek the death penalty, the State did not formally specify the aggravating factors on which it would rely. The jury found that defendant was guilty of the charged offenses and that defendant committed the murder for pecuniary gain. Because defendant had actual notice of the aggravating circumstance before trial and conceded that he suffered no prejudice from the lack of formal notice, defendant was not denied due process. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by dismissing for cause potential jurors who stated that they would not follow the law if following the law meant that defendant would be sentenced to death. The finding of the pecuniary gain aggravating factor under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(5) (Supp. 2004) was sufficiently supported by evidence showing that on the day of the murder, defendant began to set up a deal to sell the marijuana and that defendant told his wife that he was going to make a lot of money selling the marijuana for himself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised numerous claims of error as to the indictment, his convictions, and his sentences. The court rejected defendant's claims of a duplicitous indictment, improper jury selection and instructions, and improperly admitted co-conspirator statements and photographs, and held there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions. The court considered defendant's claim of a Blakely violation as to the imposition of aggravated sentences for his non-capital offenses without a jury determination of aggravating factors. The court held that the sentence imposed for the conspiracy conviction was authorized under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-904(B) (1989) without any finding of aggravating circumstances, thus, no further jury finding was required. However, the sentence imposed for armed robbery required a finding of at least two substantial aggravating factors as provided in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-1904(B) (1989), 13-702.01(A)(1) (Supp. 1996), therefore the court held that it would address whether the trial judge erred by imposing the aggravated sentence for armed robbery without jury findings of aggravating circumstances in a supplemental opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All charges arose out of the murder for hire of the deceased and the attempted murder of the victim, the deceased's girlfriend. The supreme court found that because Ring II announced a new procedural rule, application of Arizona's new death penalty statute to defendant did not violate either the federal or state Ex Post Facto Clause. Additionally, the supreme court found that the the trial court did not abuse its discretion in precluding evidence about two unrelated murders because they could have confused the jury. However, the supreme court found that the jury improperly found that the aggravating factors of pecuniary gain and endangerment were applicable. The supreme court engaged in an independent reweighing of the aggravating and mitigating factors. In balancing the mitigating evidence of a troubled childhood and unsubstantiated allegations of drug abuse, which had no more than de minimus weight, against two statutory aggravating factors that defendant had previously been convicted of a serious offense and that he committed the offenses while on authorized release from the department of corrections, the supreme court found that defendant's death sentence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sued appellee billboard company in the trial court to remove billboards which did not conform to the city's ordinance. The trial court dismissed 89 of the 173 counts in the city's original and amended complaints, under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-462.02(C). The Court of Appeals, Division Two (Arizona), affirmed, and the city sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's claims were those in its first complaint, filed before Ariz. Rev.

The supreme court held, as to claims filed before &sect; 9-462.02(C)'s effective date, no limitations period applied before the enactment of &sect; 9-462.02(C), and filing the claims tolled the limitations period in &sect; 9-462.02(C), so the claims were timely. As to claims filed after &sect; 9-462.02(C)'s effective date, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-505 governed the retroactivity of new limitation statutes. Under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-505(B), Ariz. Rev.

Even though aggravating factors did not need to be specified in the charging document, an accused in the State of Arizona was accorded notice under the rules of criminal procedure that complied with constitutional requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to reckless manslaughter. Defendant appealed the judgment of the Arizona Court of Appeals, Division Two, finding that the trial judge could impose a sentence above five years absent a jury finding of aggravators beyond a reasonable doubt without running afoul of the United States or Arizona Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The presumptive sentence for reckless manslaughter was five years, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-701(C)(1) (2001). The plea agreement provided that defendant could receive a sentence between three years and twelve and one-half years. A three-year sentence was the minimum allowed for a class two felony and required a finding of at least two substantial mitigating factors, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-702.01(B)(1) (2001). A sentence of twelve and one-half years could be imposed for a class two felony after a finding of at least two substantial aggravating factors, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-702.01(A)(1). The reviewing court held that the &quot;maximum sentence&quot; for Apprendi analysis in the instant case was the five-year presumptive sentence in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-701(C)(1). Because a sentence in excess of five years could be imposed on defendant only after a finding of one or more of the aggravating circumstances in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-702(C), the Sixth Amendment guarantee of jury trial extended to the finding of these facts and required proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, the Secretary and proponents, challenged the lower court's decision that (1) held the proposition violated Ariz. Const. art. 21, &sect; 1's &quot;separate amendment rule,&quot; and (2) ordered that the proposition not be certified or placed on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that Proposition 106, which would have affected the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act (CCEA), Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 16-940 to 16-961 (Supp. 2003), violated the &quot;separate amendment rule&quot; of Ariz. Const. art. 21, &sect; 1. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court noted that Ariz. Const. art. 21 established a stricter standard than Ariz. Const. art. 4, which applied to statutes enacted by the legislature, for determining whether a proposal involved more than one constitutional amendment. The court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-955 of the CCEA created a Citizens Clean Election Commission (CCEC), which independently administered public funding for political candidates and enforced the CCEA. Proposition 106 &sect; A proposed to prohibit public funding while &sect; C proposed to change the funding source for the CCEC and make it dependent upon a legislative appropriation to carry out it duties under the CCEA. The court found that there was no common principle between &sect;&sect; A and C that would make it likely that one voting to abolish public funding of political campaigns would also vote to strip the CCEC of its independence from legislative control.</SPAN></P>

In affirming defendant's convictions, the court held that double jeopardy did not bar retrial. The trial court's review of the record on competency did not constitute an impermissible competency determination. A correction officer's actions in overhearing defendant's conversation with his attorney did not interfere with his relationship with counsel, because he knew that his conversation could be overheard and made no effort to safeguard against interception. Because a reasonable jury could differently assess the evidence upon which the trial court based its pecuniary gain finding during sentencing, the court could not conclude that the trial court's finding of the Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(5) factor was harmless. Furthermore, because evidence was presented that defendant was in a dissociated state due to psychosis, drug impairment, or both, it could not be concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable jury could not find other than the trial court did on the issue of special cruelty as an aggravating factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Pima County Superior Court (Arizona) that convicted defendant of two counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of two victims and sentenced him to death pursuant to Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed many errors on appeal, including double jeopardy violations. The court rejected the double jeopardy claims because defendant's convictions in the first trial were reversed for deprivation of counsel, not prosecutorial misconduct. The court held that the State's addition of felony murder theories on retrial was not error. The court rejected defendant's claims regarding his competency to stand trial because the evidence showed that despite his personality disorders, defendant was likely malingering or faking mental illness and was capable of assisting defense counsel. The court affirmed defendant's convictions but vacated his death sentence because defendant was sentenced to death under a procedure found to be unconstitutional in Ring II. Under the new capital sentencing statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703.01, defendants were entitled to a jury determination as to aggravating factors under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-703(F)(5) and 13-703(F)(6). However, in this case, the trial court made the determination and the court concluded that the evidence pertaining to those factors could have been interpreted differently by a reasonable jury, thus the error was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Arizona) that reversed a tax court decision that held the taxpayers were entitled to a refund of property taxes under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-204.C (Supp. 1997) (repealed) from defendants, county and state revenue department, because the county valued their property in a discriminatory manner in violation of the Uniformity Clause, Ariz. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county valued the taxpayers' multi-family apartment properties by using a cost approach, but programmed its valuation program to &quot;roll over&quot; the value of other multi-family properties, which left the valuation unchanged. The taxpayers argued that the undervaluation of the &quot;roll-over&quot; properties resulted in the taxpayers being forced to bear a disproportionate share of the property tax in violation of the Uniformity Clause. On appeal, the court held that the taxpayers met their burden of establishing that the county intentionally and systematically used a method of valuing their property different from that used to value the roll-over properties, which resulted in the roll-over properties being valued at 66 percent of their full cash value while the taxpayers' properties were valued at 100 percent of full cash value. The court held that a refund was the appropriate remedy for such discrimination in order to make the taxpayers' tax burden uniform with that of the roll-over properties. The court reversed as to the award of attorney fees, holding that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-348.E permitted each party to receive an award of attorney fees rather than a single award for each action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the court of appeals' memorandum decision. The court affirmed the part of the tax court decision that held the taxpayers were entitled to a refund because of the greatly disproportionate valuation of their properties by the county, but reversed the tax court's decision as to the single award of attorney fees. The case was remanded to the tax court to determine the appropriate amount of refund and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in Mohave County (Arizona), which convicted him of two counts of first-degree murder, one count of first-degree burglary, one count of theft of property valued at $ 1,000 or more, one count of arson of an occupied structure, and one count of theft of means of transportation. Defendant was sentenced to death for each of the murder counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two days before the victims' bodies were discovered, bank video cameras captured defendant, who was 16 years old, attempting to withdraw money from the victims' bank account. DNA and fingerprint evidence placed defendant inside the victims' home. Several days after the bodies were discovered, defendant was found in California, in possession of the victims' car and other items. The court agreed with the trial court that Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment violations occurred during defendant's arrest and initial detention. Although the State proved that the location of defendant's motel room inevitably would have been discovered, the evidence in the room may never have been obtained lawfully. However, the introduction of the illegally seized evidence was harmless. The court found that substantial evidence supported the verdicts. The State could not seek the death penalty against a juvenile pursuant to Arizona's Automatic Filing Statute without an individual assessment of his maturity and moral responsibility at the time of the offense. The trial court also erred by refusing to consider defendant's age as a statutory mitigating circumstance when sentencing on the non-capital counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, but remanded to the trial court to determine whether, at the time of the offense, defendant possessed moral responsibility and culpability sufficient to render him eligible for the death penalty. The court also vacated the sentences imposed on defendant's non-capital convictions and remanded the non-capital counts for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff federal employees filed a class action against defendant Arizona Department of Revenue (ADOR), alleging that Arizona's income tax scheme violated intergovernmental tax immunity by treating employee contributions of federal employees differently than those of state employees. The Court of Appeals, Division One (Arizona), held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1001(2) violated the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine; ADOR appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees challenged the use in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1001(2) of federal adjusted gross income (AGI) as the base for Arizona taxable income, because it allowed state employees whose contributions were picked up to avoid current taxation. The court of appeals, reversing its earlier ruling, ultimately held that, as the effect of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1001(2) for tax years after 1990 was to require federal employees to pay current Arizona income tax on their mandatory contributions, while deferring such taxation for state and local employees, the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, as codified in 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111(a), mandated that the Arizona scheme be struck, because it was not justified by &quot;'significant differences&quot; between these classes. The supreme court disagreed. As Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1001(2) contained no overt discrimination against any taxpayer because of the source of pay, and in practical terms did not require that federal employees be taxed differently than state employees with respect to mandatory retirement contributions, the use of federal AGI as the base for Arizona taxable income did not violate the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals' decision was vacated insofar as it held that the Arizona tax scheme violated the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, and the judgment of the tax court was reversed to the same extent. The case was remanded to the tax court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The city failed to define any real and substantial risk that random, suspicionless testing was designed to address. Balancing the firefighter's privacy interests against the interests the city advanced in favor of its program's random component, the city's generalized and unsubstantiated interest in deterring and detecting alcohol and drug use among the city's firefighters by conducting random drug tests was insufficient to overcome even the lessened privacy interests of the firefighters. The program's random testing component was unreasonable and therefore violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court vacated the court of appeals decision and reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment and ordered that the trial court apply the standard it established. The court held that a foster child could establish &sect; 1983 liability against a state official by showing that the official, without justification, acted with deliberate indifference by placing a child in foster care or by maintaining a placement when the official knew that the placement exposed the child to danger or would have known of the danger but for the official's deliberate indifference.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners -- state legislators -- brought this special action challenging the Arizona governor's use of the item veto in 11 specified instances and alleging, as to each, that the governor exceeded her veto authority under the Arizona Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Of the 11 vetoes challenged, nine involved provisions in the general appropriations bill, and two pertained, respectively, to provisions in the Education and the Health and Welfare omnibus reconciliation bills (ORBs). The legislators urged that the court hold the vetoes unconstitutional and order the governor and all affected state officers and departments to implement the legislature's budget package without regard to the vetoes. The court accepted jurisdiction of the petition and held the legislators lacked standing to challenge the governor's vetoes made in connection with the legislative budget package. Although it could waive the standing requirement in an exceptional case, it declined to do so here. Even where instances of misuse of the governor's veto power could be present as alleged, the record also reflected what appeared to be non-recurring instances of unconventional budget structuring, failure to attempt legislative override or to obtain authorization to maintain the action, and numerous apparent violations of the single subject rule in the ORBs. Accordingly, notions of restraint prompted the court to abstain from further consideration of this matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 20-year-old man, sought review of an order from the Maricopa County Superior Court (Arizona), which sentenced him to a mandatory term of 52 years in prison without the possibility of parole after he was convicted of four counts of sexual misconduct with a minor. The victims were two post-pubescent teenage girls.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of four counts of sexual misconduct with a minor. On appeal, he contended that his four flat, consecutive, 13-year sentences violated the prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment found in the Eight Amendment to the United States Constitution and Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 15. The court agreed. The sentence struck the jurors, the trial judge, and the victims' mothers as an extraordinarily long sentence. Defendant's sexual relations with the victims involved neither actual nor threatened violence; the victims were willing participants. The victims sought out defendant; all acts occurred after the victims went voluntarily to defendant's home. Defendant did not have an adult criminal record. There was evidence in the record that defendant's intelligence and maturity level fell far below that of a normal young adult. The court held that the mandatory 52-year sentence was grossly disproportionate to defendant's crimes. The court further held that, because the State offered evidence of more than one offense to support its first charge against defendant and the events were not part of a single transaction, the charge was duplicitous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's conviction as to the first count and remanded for a new trial on that count. The court affirmed the remaining convictions. The court vacated the sentence imposed and remanded the case for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only issue before the supreme court was whether reversible error occurred when a trial judge sentenced defendant to death under a procedure that violated the right to a jury trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI. He had been convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. The supreme court stated that it could not conclude that the Sixth Amendment violation constituted harmless error. Thus, it vacated the death sentence and remanded for resentencing under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703 and 13-703.1 (Supp. 2002). Given the evidence, the supreme court could not conclude that all reasonable juries would have found the death especially cruel. Whether the victim lost consciousness before the stabbing began or thereafter presented a question of fact and defendant was entitled to a jury determination of that issue. Further, the supreme court could not say that no reasonable jury would have weighed differently the established aggravating and mitigating circumstances or determined that the mitigating circumstances were sufficiently substantial to call for leniency, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703E. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703.02 was to apply at resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A harmless error standard was used. There was evidence of defensive wounds, pleas for help, and attempts to resist, leaving no doubt of mental anguish. Defendant admitted that he raped the victim while she was bound. Defendant had ground a knife into the victim. Admissions showed the victim was conscious during the attack. Defendant rendered the victim helpless by binding her. The rape, facial wounds, neck ligatures, gagging, blindfolding, and grinding of the knife constituted violence beyond that necessary to kill. Any reasonable jury would have concluded that gratuitous violence was inflicted on the helpless victim and that the murder was especially heinous. There was no expert testimony that cocaine use impaired either defendant's capacity to control his conduct or to appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions. Defendant's wife's testimony that defendant was not acting himself was insufficient to establish impairment. Steps taken to avoid detection negated impairment. Defendant's age of 31 years had no mitigating weight. There was no showing of a causal link between the crimes and a lack of education. The victim's family's sentencing request was not proper mitigation evidence.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(1) aggravating factor. The murders occurred simultaneously with the robberies of each establishment and therefore facilitated defendant's ability to secure a pecuniary gain, an aggravating circumstance pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(5). Under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(8), because the armed robberies and murders were committed during a continuous course of criminal conduct at each place, they were temporally, spatially, and motivationally related. Any error with respect to the aggravating factors was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. A jury, hearing the same mitigation evidence as the trial court, could have found one or more of the statutory mitigating factors to be proven.

Defendant was not entitled to suppression of statements obtained in violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963, art. 36, 21 U.S.T. 77, 596 U.N.T.S. 261. Defendant's confession was not coerced. A juror questionnaire stating that defendant was not a U.S. citizen was permissible under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 18.5(e). A peremptory strike based upon a juror's apparent reluctance to serve was non-discriminatory. Defendant was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction. Use of dual juries was not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were two long-time employees of appellee Arizona State Schools for the Deaf and the Blind. After their employment was terminated in 2002, the employees filed suit against the schools alleging that they had been wrongfully terminated. The schools removed the suit to federal court. The United States District Court for the District of Arizona certified two questions of Arizona law to the Supreme Court of Arizona.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Until 1993, the statutes created a property interest in continued employment for permanent employees of the schools that was protected by the Due Process Clause. Employees could be terminated only after a hearing establishing appropriate cause. The employees contended that, after completing their periods of probation, they each effectively entered into employment contracts with the schools that provided that they could not be discharged without cause and that the 1993 amendments to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 15-1325 and -1326 did not apply to them without their assent or acceptance and consideration. The Supreme Court of Arizona held that generally statutes did not create contract rights. The legislature had the unquestioned right to create and abolish offices in the public interest, and that right necessarily included the power to fix or alter the term, the mode of appointment, and compensation. That was inconsistent with the assertion that statutes governing public employment generally created enforceable contract rights. To the extent that the certified question asked whether the employees had a property interest in continued employment by the State, the answer was that they did not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first certified question from the district court was answered in the affirmative. Given its answer to the first certified question, it was not necessary for the supreme court to address the second certified question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from a judgment of the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona), wherein he was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder and one count of first-degree burglary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant entered his girlfriend's brother's apartment and fatally shot him, his friend, and appellant's girlfriend. He borrowed a gun, and various witnesses had spoken with appellant about his intention to kill someone. He was arrested, charged, and convicted. On appeal, the court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1101(1) (Supp. 1999) was constitutional and not vague as applied. The court found the jury instruction on premeditation was error, which was harmless as to the girlfriend's brother, due to appellant's stated intent to kill him, but required reversal as to the other two victims, because there was no overwhelming showing of appellant's premeditation. The evidence supported the felony murder convictions, predicated on burglary based on an intent to commit assault, and there was no violation of the merger doctrine. Exclusion of appellant's evidence regarding third-party culpability and the victims' use of drugs was proper, as it was a &quot;reach,&quot; and denial of appellant's motion for a mistrial was also proper. Appellant's right to be present at trial was not violated to the extent of requiring a new trial, as it was either waived or fundamental error was not shown.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions of appellant for felony murder of the three victims, for premeditated murder of appellant's girlfriend's brother, and for first-degree burglary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of first-degree premeditated murder, kidnapping of a minor under the age of 15, and 2 counts of sexual assault of a minor under the age of 15. The judge in the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) conducted a sentencing hearing on the first-degree murder conviction under former Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In State v. Ring, (Ring III), the Supreme Court of Arizona concluded that it would examine a death sentence imposed under Arizona's superseded capital sentencing statute for harmless error. The sole issue in the case at bar was whether reversible error occurred when a trial judge sentenced defendant to death under a procedure found unconstitutional in Ring v. Arizona (Ring II). The record established beyond any reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance of the age of the victim was proved. Although the physical evidence clearly established beyond a reasonable doubt that the amount of violence used was greater than that necessary to kill the victim, the supreme court could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that a jury would have found the murder to have been especially cruel. A jury could have found that the victim lost consciousness at the beginning of the assault and thus did not suffer physical pain or mental anguish sufficient to support a finding that the murder was cruel. All of the non-statutory mitigating factors depended upon an assessment of witness credibility. The supreme court could not conclude that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The death sentence was vacated, and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

It could not be said that the trial judge's findings regarding the other 2 aggravating circumstances, that the murder was done for pecuniary gain or that the murder was committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, were harmless error. In the context of mitigating factors, the present court could not say beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable jury would necessarily conclude that defendant failed to establish mental impairment by a preponderance of the evidence. Additionally, the state legislature passed a statute barring the execution of a mentally retarded person that was applicable on resentencing. The evidence concerning defendant's mental abilities was considered only from the viewpoint of establishing mitigation, not as a potential bar to execution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that once self-defense was raised, case law treated lack of justification as an element of the offense that due process required the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant was required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the reason he shot the victim was to prevent the victim from causing serious physical injury to him or his pregnant girlfriend, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-205. The appellate court noted that defendant was not required to disprove any element of the offense. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-205 did not violate Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 4. Defendant's reliance on prior cases was without merit, as they were based on statutory interpretation rather than Arizona's due process clause. The appellate court rejected as a matter of interpretation defendant's attempt to combine Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-404, which defined self-defense, with the introductory language in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-403. Lack of self-defense was not an element of assault but an affirmative defense under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-205 that defendant had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence.

After the appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the health care provider, the patient sought review. In vacating the appellate court's decision, the court determined that the patient stated a cause of action for battery, because her consent to the procedure was ineffective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant opened fire at a homeowners' association meeting, killing the victim, petitioner's wife. In the murder trial, the husband asserted a right under Arizona's Victims' Bill of Rights, Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 2.1, to tell the jurors what sentence he thought they should impose on defendant. The trial court and the Court of Appeals of Arizona, Division One, held that he could not state his opinion on that subject. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge allowed the victim impact statements, but denied the motion as to sentencing recommendations, concluding that a victim's sentencing recommendations were not relevant to either the mitigating or aggravating factors involved in capital sentencing and that precluding the husband's opinion on sentencing did not violate his rights as a crime victim. The court also found Arizona case law clear that sentencing recommendations offered by a deceased's survivors had no relevance in a capital case. Following binding precedent from the United States Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of Arizona held that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited a victim from making a sentencing recommendation to the jury in a capital case. The victims' right to speak was not unlimited. Statements relevant to the harm caused by the defendant's criminal acts were no longer barred by the Eighth Amendment. But statements regarding sentencing exceeded those bounds, violated the Eighth Amendment, and therefore were prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Arizona Court of Appeals, Division One, remanded the case back to the superior court for a new trial, after defendant was convicted of three counts of sexual exploitation of a minor for downloading child pornography from the Internet, finding that the trial court erred in refusing to strike a venireperson for cause. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the courts should continue to follow a prior case's automatic reversal rule, where reversal was the only feasible way to vindicate a party's substantial right to peremptory challenges. A majority of state courts, following a U.S. Supreme Court decision, held that the curative use of a peremptory challenge violated neither a constitutional nor a rule-based or statute-based right. A showing of prejudice was required before a case would be reversed when a defendant used a peremptory challenge to remove a juror the trial court should have excused for cause. The appellate court concluded that a defendant in a criminal case had to show prejudice and the Arizona Constitution and harmless error statute obligated the appellate court to review trial error in criminal cases under a harmless error standard. Sufficiently compelling reasons existed for overruling State v. Huerta, 175 Ariz. 262, 855 P.2d 776 (1993), where the right of a peremptory challenge was not given the same weight as the right to a fair and impartial jury. Defendant's case was fair and impartial, and he did not exhaust his peremptory challenges. An objectionable juror was not forced upon him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated as to the court of appeals' decision that reversed based on the prior case, and affirmed as to defendant's convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of attempted murder, armed robbery, kidnapping, aggravated assault, premeditated murder, and felony murder. During the sentencing hearing, the trial court found that two aggravating circumstances outweighed the two mitigating circumstances. Defendant's conviction for premeditated murder was reversed, but all of the other convictions and the sentences were affirmed. After a decision was rendered by the United States Supreme Court in another case, the court reviewed defendant's death sentence for harmless error. In vacating the sentence, the court determined that there was sufficient evidence presented to prove the aggravating circumstance for prior convictions under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(2) (Supp. 1998). The jury was not required to determine prior convictions. However, the jury could have made a different determination about whether or not sufficient evidence of pecuniary gain had been presented under &sect; 13-703(F)(5). There was little evidence as to defendant's intent and motivation regarding the murder of the witness. Finally, the court noted that a jury might have found additional mitigating factors or weighed them differently during sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held, in light of defendant's admissions of pecuniary motive, that no reasonable jury could have found that defendant did not shoot the victim for pecuniary gain; therefore, it declined to disturb the trial judge's finding that the aggravating circumstance of pecuniary gain rendered him eligible for the death penalty. However, the supreme court could not say that a reasonable jury would not have found additional mitigating factors or weighed the mitigating factors differently. The supreme court concluded that it could not say beyond a reasonable doubt that, if a jury found additional mitigating circumstances or weighed the mitigating circumstances differently, the jury would not have found them sufficiently substantial to call for leniency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The erroneous sentencing procedure used by the trial court did not result in harmless error; therefore, defendant's death sentence was vacated, and the matter remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

After the aggravation/mitigation hearing, the Superior Court for Maricopa County (Arizona) found that the State had established three aggravating circumstances and sentenced defendant to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the prosecutor failed to give notice of the State's intent to prove the third aggravating circumstance prior serious conviction within the time period prescribed by former Ariz. R. Crim. P. 15.1.g(2). As a result, he unknowingly prejudiced himself by entering the guilty plea in the assault case. The State had not filed notice of the prior serious conviction aggravating circumstance within 10 days of defendant's first-degree murder conviction, as required by superseded Rule 15.1.g(2). However, the State could not give notice of the prior serious conviction aggravating circumstance until defendant had committed that crime. The Supreme Court of Arizona held that because defendant had actual, although oral, notice of the prosecutor's intent to use the aggravated assault conviction as a prior serious offense aggravating circumstance and the delay caused him no prejudice, he was adequately noticed of the prior serious conviction aggravating circumstance. The aggravated assault plea was entered at a proceeding unrelated to the first-degree murder trial and because defendant pleaded guilty to aggravated assault, he waived any right to direct appeal in that action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court could not conclude that no reasonable probability existed that a jury would not have imposed the death penalty. It was impossible for the court to say just how a jury may have balanced the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in defendant's case. To find the error harmless, the appellate court had to determine that, if a jury had made the sentencing determination, and, if that jury had been presented with a single murder conviction rather than three, and, if it had considered only the Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(1) and (F)(2) aggravators rather than also an (F)(6) aggravator, and, if it had considered the (F)(1) aggravator on the basis of kidnapping and sexual assault charges rather than multiple homicides, that jury would have found that the mitigating circumstances were not sufficiently substantial to call for leniency. Under these circumstances, the court held that the finding of error to be harmless was too speculative. Thus, defendant's death sentence was vacated and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, defendant argued that he was denied a fair trial, because the trial court did not comply with Ariz. R.

Although the accomplice testified he could not remember any details about the alleged unknown shooter, the videotaped interview showed that he had a clear recollection of many details of the evening of the murder. For example, he remembered the color of defendant's brother's jersey. The Supreme Court of Arizona held that those statements had substantive value. The accomplice told the court and the jury that he lied to the police, as he was scared, was threatened, and was intoxicated. Admission of the entire videotape allowed the jurors to assess his demeanor and credibility and helped them decide which of his accounts to believe. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion by admitting the videotaped interview. Regarding the death sentence, because Ring III had been issued, the supreme court, by separate order, directed the parties to submit supplemental briefing in accordance with that opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed. The sentences for armed robbery and attempted murder were affirmed. The sentence on the murder conviction was to be addressed in a supplemental opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents sued appellee city to recover for injuries their child sustained in a city park. The city claimed that, because the park was held open for recreational use, the parents could not prevail unless they showed that city employees were grossly negligent. The trial court granted summary judgment for the city. The parents appealed. The Court of Appeals, Division One (Arizona), affirmed. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-1551's, the recreational use statute, requirement that the parent's show gross negligence or wilful or malicious conduct abrogated a cause of action that their child would have otherwise enjoyed, in violation of the anti-abrogation provision of the Arizona Constitution, Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6. The Supreme Court of Arizona concluded that the child failed to establish that a right of action for simple negligence, against a municipality engaged in a governmental function, existed at common law. Arizona's anti-abrogation provision was designed to protect rights of action in existence at the time it was adopted, but not necessarily those later created. Accordingly, because a suit against a city for simple negligence could not have been maintained at the time the anti-abrogation provision was instituted, it was not protected by that provision, if the city was acting in its governmental capacity. The supreme court concluded that the city held the park open to the public for recreational use. Its maintenance of the park was a governmental function, and the recreational use statute shielded the city's acts, which was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court held that Arizona's capital sentencing scheme violated the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. The Supreme Court remanded the matter to the state court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand, the state supreme court considered the sentences of 31 defendants sentenced to death and had matters pending on direct appeal before the supreme court. The state supreme court consolidated all 31 death penalty cases then on direct appeal. The Supreme Court ruled that a jury had to determine certain aggravating circumstances in order to impose a death penalty. The state supreme court found that in some of the consolidated cases, the state supreme court's review would not allow the conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to or affect the capital sentence. In those cases, the state supreme court had to remand for resentencing. Other cases would involve aggravators that would be regarded as established. In those cases, because a trier of fact had to determine whether mitigating circumstances called for leniency, the state supreme court would affirm a capital sentence only if it concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that no rational trier of fact would determine that the mitigating circumstances were sufficiently substantial to call for leniency. If it could not reach that conclusion, the case had to be remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The state's highest court affirmed the conviction as there was overwhelming direct and circumstantial evidence of defendant's reflection for premeditation. However, regarding the imposition of the death penalty, after defendant was sentenced, in Atkins, the Unites States Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibited the execution of mentally retarded persons. Due process demanded that defendant's mental retardation claim receive a hearing at which the constitutional principles announced in Atkins were considered. Although defendant presented testimony from two experts, and the State responded in kind, the adversarial procedure by which defendant's mental retardation was considered differed in nature and scope from the process created by the legislature in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703.02, which did not take effect until after defendant's sentencing but contemplated a more thorough examination by experts selected by the trial judge, in consultation with the parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, the delay between the crime and the indictment prejudiced him by denying his right to cross-examination. Defendant also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence on the murder conviction. The appellate court found that defendant failed to raise his arraignment argument in a pretrial motion. Because defendant did not make a motion to dismiss 20 days before trial, defendant was barred from doing so by Ariz. R. Crim. P. 16.1(b) and (c). In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, defendant argued that the State's case was built on the improperly admitted videotaped eyewitness testimony and, had that been excluded, there would not have been sufficient evidence of first degree murder. The court found that the videotaped evidence was properly admitted. The State acted reasonably and in good faith to procure the witnesses attendance at trial. Further, the witnesses testified at the preliminary hearing and both were cross-examined under oath. Therefore, the preliminary hearing videotape bore sufficient indicia of reliability and afforded the trier of fact a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.</SPAN></P>

At trial, defendant did not deny killing his wife, but claimed that he did so in the heat of passion, making the killing manslaughter or, at most, second degree murder. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1105(A)(1) (2001). The supreme court was called upon to decide whether the definition of premeditation, contained within Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1101(1) (2001), abolished the requirement of actual reflection altogether, whether it eliminated the requirement of direct proof of actual reflection, or whether it substituted for the necessary proof of actual reflection the mere passage of enough time to permit reflection. The supreme court concluded that the jury instruction given in this case was erroneous, but it also concluded that the flawed instruction did not affect the verdict. The supreme court directed trial judges, in the future, as to how to instruct juries with regard to premeditation, and clarified that the State could not use the passage of time as a proxy for premeditation. Finally, the supreme court concluded that &sect; 13-1105(A)(1) was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate proceedings, the trial courts ordered civil commitments to a state mental hospital of the real parties in interest, alleged sexually violent individuals (individuals), as defined in Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals argued that Arizona's Sexually Violent Person Act (SVP), Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 36-3701 to 36-3717, lacked any requirement that the state prove an alleged SVP's mental disorder caused him or her to have serious difficulty in controlling behavior, and they argued that the statute was unconstitutional. The appellate court did not agree that due process mandated explicit references to words such as &quot;control&quot; or &quot;capacity&quot; in civil commitment statutes for several reasons. The appellate court determined that the SVP statute narrowed the class of persons subject to civil commitment. Further, the appellate court directed trial judges to instruct juries in future SVP proceedings that the state must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the person had a mental disorder that made it highly probable that the person would engage in future acts of sexual violence. A finding of dangerousness, alone, would be insufficient. The individual's dangerousness must be caused by a mental disorder that caused the person to have serious difficulty in controlling his or her behavior.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, the Arizona Court of Appeals, Division One, reversed the trial court and held that the state constitution permitted defendant state agency to refuse to fund medically necessary abortion procedures for pregnant women suffering from serious illness while funding such procedures for rape or incest victims or when the abortion was necessary to save the woman's life. The instant court granted review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were doctors who performed abortions. The agency provided Medicaid services to qualified Arizona women with incomes at or below 140 percent of the federally set poverty level. The doctors argued that the funding policy, set forth in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 35-196.02, prevented medically necessary abortions for agency patients and violated the Arizona Constitution. Basing its decision entirely on the Arizona Constitution, the instant court concluded that, insofar as the state scheme permitted funding of abortions for one class of pregnant women, the state constitution did not permit it to deny funding for others for whom abortions were medically necessary to save the woman's health. Applying strict scrutiny to the fundamental right to choose, the instant court concluded that the state's legitimate interest in promoting childbirth was not so compelling as to permit it to effectively destroy an indigent woman's opportunity to choose to take medically necessary steps to preserve her health. It also observed that the trial court's requirement that the agency fund medically necessary abortions to the same extent that it funded other pregnancy-related services was too broad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The opinion of the court of appeals was vacated. The trial court's judgment was affirmed insofar as it precluded application of the statute to situations in which therapeutic abortions were medically necessary to enable doctors to administer treatment necessary to address serious health problems of pregnant agency patients. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the instant court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state legislator received a parking ticket and fine, on which a 10 percent surcharge, authorized by the Act, was assessed.

He filed a federal t action, which was dismissed because the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1341, deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction. He filed in Maricopa County Superior Court, urging the state courts to find the Act unconstitutional. The group that sponsored the initiative intervened in support of the Act and the trial court upheld the constitutionality of Act's surcharge on civil and criminal fines. The court of appeals reversed, finding the surcharge unconstitutionally restrained free speech, and enjoined the State from imposing it. The instant court stayed the court of appeals' opinion, and granted review to determine whether the Act's surcharge provision impermissibly compelled the surcharge payers' political speech, in violation of the First Amendment's freedom of speech guarantee.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Bar of Arizona brought a reciprocal disciplinary proceeding against respondent attorney who had been censured in another state. A hearing officer and the Attorney Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Arizona found that the attorney had violated Ariz. Sup. Ct. R. 42.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Oregon State Bar charged the attorney with violating Or. Code Prof. Resp. DR 1-102(A)(3), 7-102(A)(5), and Or.

The attorney claimed that he thought he could misrepresent his identity or purpose to gather information without violating the code of professional responsibility. The Supreme Court of Oregon reviewed the decision of the trial panel de novo and held that the bar was not estopped from prosecuting the attorney, that he had violated both the rules and statute identified above, and that the attorney's defense based on the state and federal constitutions was not well taken. The appropriate sanction was a public reprimand.

The State argued that the motion could not be treated as a Rule 10.3 motion because that rule referred only to trials and specifically excluded motions based on &quot;the interest or prejudice of the trial judge.&quot; The appellate court agreed that the hybrid motion was properly treated as a motion for change of judge for cause. The record indicated that defendant knew of the professional relationship at least six months prior to the disclosure. Defendant failed to timely file his Rule 10.1 motion. Defendant claimed on appeal that he based his motion on an ethical conflict, to which objection could not be waived. The appellate court held that defendant expressly disclaimed any reliance on the Arizona Code of Judicial Conduct as a basis for the recusal.

The trial court found probable cause to believe that defendant had committed the crimes charged and the Arizona Court of Appeals declined jurisdiction of defendant's special action. Defendant appealed and the prosecution of all three charges were stayed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a county sheriff and his sister was stopped for an apparent traffic violation. Defendant's sister was released to his custody and she was never arrested. Defendant asked the deputy who pulled his sister over to prepare a report of the incident, and after reviewing the report, asked the deputy to omit certain information and made suggested editorial changes. The edited report included relevant details of the traffic stop, but omitted facts that could be considered irrelevant or personal. The supreme court granted review to determine whether the term &quot;substantial interest&quot; as it was used in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-503(B) (2001) encompassed defendant's conduct. The State argued that defendant's conduct fell within the ambit of the conflict of interest statute since both defendant and his sister had some financial interest to gain or lose by her arrest, incarceration and prosecution for drug possession. The supreme court ruled that the interests involved did not fall within the scope of the conflict of interest statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona) found defendant guilty of first-degree premeditated murder, kidnapping, and two counts of sexual assault of a minor. The trial judge sentenced him to death on the murder charge, in addition to several noncapital sentences. Because the trial judge sentenced defendant to death for the murder, direct appeal to the supreme court was automatic.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's body was found in a dumpster. She had been stabbed and sexually assaulted. Defendant was a suspect because several items belonging to him were found under the victim's body. A detective asked defendant to come to the police station. Detectives interviewed him and ultimately decided to hold him for further questioning. He was read the Miranda warnings, and questioning continued until he requested counsel, at which point the questioning ceased. After defendant spoke with his mother, he made taped statements to the detective. The supreme court found that defendant initiated the discussion with the detective and that he made a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of his rights. Thus, defendant's post-Miranda statements to the detective were admissible. Additionally, the results of the blood test were admissible at trial. Also, the introduction of cumulative, non-essential, and gruesome photographs was harmless error because of the strength of the evidence against defendant. Finally, because the United States Supreme Court determined that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703 was unconstitutional, defendant's sentence of death might have been improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions and sentences were affirmed except for the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After Arizona's death penalty statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703, was declared unconstitutional, the Supreme Court of Arizona consolidated all 31 capital cases pending before it on appeal and issued an order to establish a procedure for case management.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 31 capital cases pending before the supreme court were at various stages of the process on direct appeal. There were several cases among the 31 in which an opinion had not yet been filed. In them, the supreme court stated it would proceed in the normal course by filing opinions as and when ready. Those opinions, however, would address only the guilt phase of the prosecution. If the conviction was affirmed, the opinions would reserve for later determination all matters pertaining to sentencing. The supreme court directed the State and defense counsel to prepare briefs on several questions which appeared to remain unanswered in the aftermath of the decision striking down the capital sentencing statute. The issues to be addressed were : (1) what was the supreme court permitted to do in order properly to address and deal with the sentencing phase of the captioned cases; (2) what steps did counsel recommend be undertaken by the supreme court in order properly to address and deal with the sentencing issues of the 31 cases; and (3) assuming the state legislature enacted a statute in response to the decision, could such legislation affect sentencing in the 31 cases?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court ordered that the cases be consolidated for compliance with its order that set forth the issues to be briefed, required designation of a lead counsel, established a briefing schedule, and set a pre-briefing conference date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant secretary of state refused to accept plaintiff independent presidential candidate's nominating petitions to appear on a ballot, as they were filed two months beyond the statutory deadline. The candidate file suit, and the trial court denied him relief. The Court of Appeals, Division One (Arizona), reversed, holding that the deadlines in Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court rejected the secretary's arguments with respect to mootness, laches, and standing. Although the Arizona Supreme Court agreed with the court's resolution of the latter issues, it concluded that &sect; 16-341 did not impose severe restrictions on the candidate's First Amendment rights and furthered important regulatory interests of the State. His exclusion from the ballot resulted not from a filing deadline that discriminated against independents, but rather from his failed attempt to be nominated by his party. Nowhere did it appear that the views he espoused or the voters he purported to represent were other than those of the Libertarian Party, which were already represented by the successful slate of Libertarian electors. Voters were not deprived of either the right to associate to advance their political beliefs or the right to cast their votes effectively. The restrictions imposed were reasonable and nondiscriminatory. The time frame created was rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in ensuring an orderly resolution of those challenges before the deadline for composing, translating, printing, and distributing the final ballots.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree felony murder, as well as numerous non-homicide counts. Following a sentencing hearing, the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) sentenced defendant to death. Defendant raised numerous issues on appeal, inter alia, that officers continued to question him after he made a clear and unambiguous request for counsel, and therefore the trial court should have excluded his confession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff's department conducted two videotaped interviews with defendant after his arrest. He was given Miranda warnings prior to the first interview and then proceeded to describe all three robberies and confess to his role in them. The appellate court held that defendant's statement that he wanted a lawyer, but that the detectives could ask questions, superseded his request for counsel. The interviewer clarified that the statement demonstrated an intent to speak with detectives by asking if he would talk to them at that point. Defendant replied that he would talk to them then. The state's supreme court held that defendant reinitiated contact with police after his request for counsel. Defendant also claimed that the trial court's reasonable doubt instruction improperly shifted the burden of proof to him. In its instruction, the trial court defined reasonable doubt as proof that left the jury firmly convinced of defendant's guilt. The trial court gave the reasonable doubt instruction approved in Portillo, which was not an error. The trial court did not err when it did not provide a proximate cause instruction to the jury sua sponte, because causation was not an issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1994, the dentist told the patient that, because the outcome of the reconstruction work was not what he hoped or expected or what the patient deserved, he was referring her to another dentist and would pay for that treatment. The Arizona Supreme Court granted review to examine application of the discovery rule to situations in which a patient was aware that she had been injured during the course of a physician's treatment, but unaware that the injury was attributable to fault or neglect. The court concluded that for the case at bar, the questions of discovery, and resulting accrual were for the jury and declined to adopt a rule that, in every case, required a patient or client, who suffered an adverse result, to question her doctors or lawyers about the possibility of negligence. The core question was whether a reasonable person would have been on notice to investigate. The dentist assured her he had done nothing wrong, and the court held that, as a matter of law, she was not on notice to commence investigating whether he was negligent, especially when the doctors to whom she was referred failed to disclose to her their belief that the dentist was negligent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter's complaint alleged that a proposition was invalid, as it was an unconstitutional special law and because the publicity pamphlets were not timely mailed pursuant to &sect; 19-123. The Arizona Supreme Court concluded that the city had not violated the election statutes and that the charter amendment was not an unconstitutional special law. The court of appeals specifically construed &sect; 19-141.A's requirement that pamphlets be distributed &quot;not less than ten days before the election at which measures were to be voted upon,&quot; as requiring pamphlet distribution ten days before any voting could occur, not just ten days before the day of the election. By describing the early ballots as being &quot;for the election at which the measures were to be voted on,&quot; the legislature distinguished early voting from election day. The former law, which was the law under which the city conducted its general election, required distribution ten days before election day. The city's charter amendment rested on a rational basis, encompassed all those who were and would become mayors, and allowed persons to move into and out of the class, and did not constitute a prohibited special law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of an aggravated assault that he committed with a golf club. The life sentence was mandatory under the laws existing at the time, as he committed the crime while on probation for drug and property offenses. The legislature subsequently concluded that some of the mandatory sentences imposed under existing laws were unduly harsh and amended many of the statutes. Under the new legislation, if on review of the sentence, the board unanimously recommended commutation, and the governor failed to act on that recommendation within 90 days, the recommendation for commutation automatically became effective. A letter denying commutation of appellant's sentence was received. However, the letter did not bear sufficient indicia of authenticity, it lacked an official letterhead, a legible signature, and lacked any indication that it came from the governor's office, nor was it attested to by the secretary of state. The supreme court held that the denial of a clemency request was an official act that required the governor's signature, the attestation statute contemplated only the governor act to reject the recommendation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of first degree felony murder, first degree burglary, and two counts of armed robbery. The Pinal County Superior Court (Arizona) imposed the death penalty on the murder conviction. Defendant appealed and, inter alia, made a Batson challenge based on the state's removal of five of the seven Hispanic members of the jury pool.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was Hispanic, and the trial judge found that fact met defendant's burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination and asked the state to explain its strikes. The court ruled that the reasons offered by the state were race-neutral and denied defendant's Batson challenge. Defendant contended that this was error. The supreme court held that Batson challenges were governed by a three-step analysis: (1) the party challenging the strikes must make a prima facie showing of discrimination; (2) the striking party must provide a race-neutral reason for the strike; and (3) if a race-neutral explanation was provided, the trial court must determine whether the challenger carried its burden of proving purposeful racial discrimination. Although the fact that the state accepted other Hispanic jurors on the venire was indicative of a nondiscriminatory motive, it was not dispositive. Four of the five challenged strikes were based on objective facts, for example, one of the jurors knew one of the state's witnesses, and the fifth was based on a subjective belief that the juror's family harbored ill feelings toward the prosecutor's office. All were race-neutral challenges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence on the second allegation of armed robbery was reversed, and all remaining convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his convictions and sentences by the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) for, inter alia, several murders, attempted first degree murders, and sexual assaults. He claimed, inter alia, that limits placed upon cross-examination at trial violated his fundamental right to confront adverse witnesses under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that defendant's right to confront adverse witnesses had been violated. Because the appellate court could not say beyond a reasonable doubt that the error had no effect on seven of the thirty-seven verdicts, including two of the first-degree murder convictions, it had to reverse them. The court also agreed that defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were violated because of a ruling that precluded him from presenting expert testimony regarding the protocol, validation studies, and match window of the DNA analysis. The trial judge's application of Ariz. R. Evid. 403 was based on the erroneous assumption that evidence from the Frye hearing would play no significant role in the jury's consideration. Thus, the trial court abused its discretion when it found that the probative value of that evidence was outweighed by the risk of juror confusion. However, for all but three of the victims, there was credible eye-witness identification, physical evidence apart from DNA, or other corroborating facts that clearly implicated the defendant, and the error was harmless as to them. The counts relating to the attacks upon three of the other victims were another matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state land commissioner (Commissioner) denied the applications of plaintiff environmentalists who were the highest bidders for grazing leases on three parcels of land that were part of the state's school land trust, which was administered by defendant state land department (Department). The Court of Appeals, Division One (Arizona) affirmed the commissioner and trial court. The environmentalists requested review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner's denial was premised on the conclusion that the statutory scheme did not permit the issuance of grazing leases for the purpose of restoring the land. Though the commissioner had classified all the parcels of land as grazing land, the environmentalists did not intend to graze livestock on any of the parcels in question. They intended that the land would be rested for the entire term of the ten-year leases. They requested that the commissioner permitted them to use the land for purposes other than domestic livestock grazing. The Supreme Court of Arizona examined the denial in light of the commissioner's fiduciary duty with respect to the administration of the school land trust. The court held that the Ariz. Const. art. X did not permit the commissioner to reject a high bid for a grazing lease without considering the benefit to the land in question or the trust lands in general, merely because the high bidder proposed to rest and restore land that the commissioner had classified as usable only for grazing. The commissioner's fiduciary duty required him to consider the bids and ascertain whether they were best for the corpus of the trust and its beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals' opinion was vacated, and the case was remanded to the trial court with instructions to enter judgment requiring the commissioner to determine whether the environmentalists high bids were, in the long term, best for the school trust lands and their beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>

The State claimed that defendant agreed to kill the woman in exchange for $ 100,000 to be paid by the son of the victim's deceased husband. On appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court held: (1) the superior court did not err in excluding third party culpability evidence; (2) the superior court did not err in finding that a State's witness had not been successfully hypnotized and permitting her to testify about an identification she made of defendant after the failed hypnosis session; (3) the superior court did not err in permitting defendant's ex-wife to testify she left him because she could not live with someone who could be involved in a murder; (4) the superior court did not err in permitting defendant's ex-wife to testify about acts she observed and to impeach defendant by testifying about otherwise privileged marital communications after he denied having such conversations; (5) the superior court did not err in refusing to admit the results of a polygraph examination at the aggravation/mitigation hearing; and (6) the Arizona death penalty statute was not unconstitutional on its face and/or as applied in this case.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that: (1) it was improper for the court to find that the murder was motivated by pecuniary gain because the murder took place an hour after the victim had been subdued, and was not necessary to aid the defendant in committing the robbery, but, the trial court did not err in finding that the crime was aggravated because the defendant stabbed the victim three times while she was conscious; and (2) the trial court did not err in refusing to allow the victim's daughter to testify in mitigation because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703.D expressly forbids the consideration of any sentencing recommendation to be made by the victim, the defendant's difficult childhood was irrelevant to sentencing because there was no nexus between that and the crime, and evidence that the defendant was high on crack cocaine, anxious, and spaced out were insufficient to establish that he could not appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Maricopa County Superior Court (Arizona) jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, armed robbery, burglary, and theft.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Arizona's capital punishment sentencing scheme was unconstitutional and that the trial judge erred in: (1) denying his motion to suppress because, among other things, the affidavit supporting the necessity of wiretap evidence was deficient; (2) denying defendant's motion for new trial; (3) finding that defendant killed the victim; and (4) finding aggravating circumstances. The instant court held that the affidavit fully complied with the necessity requirement and that the trial judge's reasons for denying defendant's motion to suppress were well articulated. Thus, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant's motion to suppress on necessity grounds. Defendant's alleged inability to access his entire Federal Bureau of Investigation file did not render his trial so unfair as to require the granting of a new trial. Arizona's death penalty scheme was not unconstitutional. Although the court disapproved the trial court's finding that defendant murdered the victim in a heinous or depraved manner, it concluded that the application of the pecuniary gain aggravating factor was supported. No other evidence existed in the record to merit leniency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Witnesses identified defendant and another as the ones who left the overturned vehicle of a woman who had been found shot dead. Defendant had the gun, taken from his neighbor, that had shot the woman. Two of defendant's acquaintances testified that he had stated that he wanted to do a car-jacking and killing. Defendant was convicted, among other things, of premeditated murder; the Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(5) pecuniary gain aggravator, and a youth mitigator, were found; and he was sentenced to death. The court affirmed. Witness identification of defendant had been detailed. Defendant's arrest statements had been voluntary, but when he chose not to testify, he waived the right to claim erroneous admission of involuntary statements for impeachment. Admission of testimony of the prior consistent statements of a witness had been cumulative, thus not an abuse of discretion. The jury's failure to convict of felony murder did not mandate rejection of the &sect; 13-703(F)(5) factor. Defendant failed to causally connect the mitigators of his personality disorder or family dysfunction to his crime when committed. Defendant had not killed impulsively, but with deliberation and delay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Single aggravator of murder for pecuniary gain sufficiently warranted death penalty, although defendant was only 20. No causal connection between personality disorder and family dysfunction mitigators had been found. Evidence against defendant was strong.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court remanded a case involving complex general stream adjudication to the trial court. On remand, the trial court entered an order defining &quot;subflow&quot; as the saturated floodplain Holocene alluvium, and concluding that: (1) all wells located within the lateral limits of the subflow zone were subject to the adjudication; (2) all wells located outside the subflow zone that were pumping water from a stream or its subflow, as determined by an analysis of the well's cone of depression, were included in the adjudication; and (3) wells that, although pumping subflow, had a de minimus effect on the river system might be excluded from the adjudication based on rational guidelines. When the case returned from remand, the issue before the state supreme court was whether the trial court had properly determined what underground water constituted &quot;subflow&quot; of a surface stream, thus making it appropriable under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45-141(A). The state supreme court affirmed the trial court's order, because the record reasonably supported the trial court's findings, and the ruling comported with prior decisions, as well as hydrological reality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of three counts of first degree murder and sentenced to death. He appealed, arguing admitting statements made to police was error, and he was not given Miranda warnings. Affirming, the court found that appellant's statements were properly admitted because there was no suggestion of police overreaching. Appellant failed to point to any evidence in the record indicating that police exploited his mental state, remorse, his age, or his fear to gain a confession, thus, the State proved that appellant's statements were voluntary. The court found that appellant's statement in which he admitted an officer read him his rights both from a card and from memory was made only minutes after the warnings were read, when appellant's recollection was fresh, thus, appellant was fully advised. Finally, the court's independent reweigh of aggravating and mitigating circumstances showed that even crediting appellant's cooperation with police, his age, his potential for rehabilitation, and family support, was not sufficiently substantial to call for leniency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Although appellant's age was a mitigating circumstance, in light of appellant's criminal history and his extensive participation in the murders, the court accorded his age little weight in its independent reweigh of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and found that the death sentence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of six counts of first-degree murder, one count of first-degree attempted murder, three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery, and two counts of first-degree burglary. He was sentenced to death. On direct appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected appellant's contentions of prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecutor's single reference to the death penalty did not constitute reversible error. Appellant was not denied his right to be present at trial, because he was not excluded from any trial proceeding that involved any actual confrontation. Appellant failed to prove sufficient mitigating factors to justify a lesser sentence. Specifically, appellant did not prove the good character factor, because he committed crimes as a juvenile, and had been in and out of prison for felony convictions since that time.</SPAN></P>
