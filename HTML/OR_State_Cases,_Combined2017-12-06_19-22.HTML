Stat. &sect; 161.067(3) since defendant gained possession of the two firearms at different times that were separated by a pause sufficient to give defendant an opportunity to renounce his criminal intent; [2]-The appellate court had jurisdiction over the appeal because defendant's merger argument meant that the appeal was based on the sentence within the meaning of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.222(7), and the appellate court had authority to review that argument because it raised a claim that the sentencing court failed to comply with requirements of law in imposing or failing to impose a sentence under &sect; 138.222(4)(a).</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 14.175 for matters capable of repetition but likely to evade judicial review did not apply because the availability of a procedure for requesting expedited review under Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners argued that they had a property right because of their actions to take advantage of Measure 37, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.305 (2007), and that that property right was protected by Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 and U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV from being taken without payment of compensation. The landowners argued that the loss of the property interest by operation of Measure 49 entitled them to compensation. The appellate court found that the retroactive application of Measure 49 to the landowners' Measure 37 claim for just compensation did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 18. The Measure 37 waivers were not the equivalent of judgments and did not create an enforceable right against a private or public entity. They were simply zoning permits. The landowners pointed to no allegation that they engaged in any activities on their land related to its development under the waivers. The landowners' ability to vest their right to develop their property consistently with their Measure 37 waivers was not conditioned on giving up any constitutional right, nor did the governmental entities act to prevent the landowners from pursuing such development.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that they had a vested right for compensation under Measure 37 that could not be destroyed by the retroactive application of Measure 49. The court concluded that Measure 49 replaced and altered the remedies previously available under Measure 37 for reduction in property value caused by land use regulations. Retroactive application of Measure 49 to plaintiffs' claims did not run afoul of the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause. Measure 37 did not embody a contractual commitment by the government to allow plaintiffs' Measure 37 suit for monetary compensation to continue unabated. Further, plaintiffs had not yet achieved a final, unreviewable judgment on their Measure 37 claims when Measure 49 became effective on December 6, 2007. Plaintiffs' takings argument failed because they identified no cognizable property interest protected by the Fifth Amendment. Because plaintiffs' Measure 37 claims had not been extinguished by a final, unreviewable, judgment by December 6, 2007, they were superseded by Measure 49 and were no longer justiciable. The trial court did not err in dismissing them or in denying plaintiffs' motion for entry of judgment nunc pro tunc.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.352, waiver of land use restrictions on the owners' property after the enactment of Measure 49, as codified at Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.305.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners had purchased the property when it was zoned for residential uses and one-acre home sites were permitted. However, after the owners' purchase, the county downzoned the property to agricultural zoning, and a 80-acre minimum lot size for a residence was required. The owners obtained a Measure 37 waiver of the post-acquisition rezonings from the county. After Measure 49 was adopted, the county refused to issue development permits. On appeal, the court affirmed. Based on recent case law, the Measure 37 waiver did not create a contractual obligation with the county that could not be breached or impaired; additionally, the repeal of the Measure 37 waiver did not unduly burden judicial functioning under Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. Although the owners argued that the repeal of the Measure 37 waiver was a taking of their property without just compensation under U.S. Const. amend. V, the owners were not deprived of all economically viable uses of their property sufficient to create a per se taking as the property could still be used according to the applicable agricultural zoning and Measure 49 gave the owners the right to construct additional residences on the parcels.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Yamhill County Circuit Court, Oregon, affirmed respondent Board of County Commissioners of Yamhill County's determinations that respondents landowners had a vested right to complete development of a 41-lot residential subdivision in compliance with county and state waivers issued pursuant to Ballot Measure 37 (2004), Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.305 (2007). Appellant neighbors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The neighbors argued that the reviewing court erred in sustaining the vesting officer's determination that the landowners had a vested right to complete the residential development. The appellate court rejected the neighbors' contentions that the expenditures that the landowners made up to the effective date of Measure 49 were not made in good faith. It was objectively reasonable for the landowners to conclude, from a fair reading of Measure 49, that the actions they took before the election would constitute good faith efforts to vest their right to keep, develop and/or sell all of the lots in their subdivision. The concept of substantial expenditures required an examination of both the absolute amount expended and the percentage yielded by the expenditure ratio. The reviewing court should have remanded for the county to determine the extent and general cost of the project to be vested and to give proper weight to the expenditure ratio favor in the totality of the circumstances of the case. The appellate court declined to address the neighbors' other contentions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse for molesting his daughter while she slept. The trial court denied his petition for postconviction relief. On appeal, the court found that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to discover and offer additional evidence about his ex-wife and her influence over the victim. The evidence would have distracted from the defense theory that the ex-wife had induced their daughters to accuse petitioner of sexual abuse because they feared him and wanted him out of the picture. Further, trial counsel told petitioner that he did not want to make it appear that the defense was &quot;grasping at straws&quot; by highlighting the ex-wife's sexual abuse, which had occurred 25 years earlier. That was not an unreasonable position. Extrinsic evidence that the ex-wife had previously accused persons other than petitioner of sexual abuse was inadmissible under Or. Evid. Code 404(3) and 608(2). As to testimony regarding past statements by the ex-wife to the effect that she would accuse petitioner of crimes to keep custody of her children, the evidence suggested that petitioner had never heard of those threats until after he was convicted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washington County Circuit Court, Oregon, dismissed plaintiff landowner's claims against defendants, State of Oregon and Washington County, in nine consolidated cases.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner argued that Measure 37, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.305, waivers were contracts between the landowner and the state or county, and that the state and county breached or unconstitutionally impaired the obligations of those waiver contracts by implementing Measure 49, 2007 Or. Laws 424. The appellate court agreed with defendants and concluded that no contract was formed by the issuance of any Measure 37 waiver. Measure 37 lacked any commitment by the state not to repeal or amend waivers in the future. Measure 37 allowed an option to waive the application of past land use regulations in order to permit a specified land use. It said nothing about the state's authority to impose future regulations on land development, whether in the form of Measure 49 or otherwise. The trial court did not err in concluding that the landowner's complaints stated no claim under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The legislature had constitutional authority, without violating Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, to alter the relief provided by counties and administrative agencies under Measure 37. The county commissioners and state director were not judges and they did not sit in courts that were created by law.</SPAN></P>

The assessment imposed upon the owners included their share of the city's cost of acquiring their land for the project. The court held that requiring the owners to pay for their share of the city's cost to acquire a portion of their property for the public improvement did not violate the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, because the owners received just compensation for the property that the city acquired. Case law established that the benefits represented by special assessments had to be paid for by a condemnee in the same manner and in the same proportion as other property owners benefited by the improvement.

A defendant convicted in municipal court and circuit court could appeal to the court only if the defendant was challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance he was convicted of violating; defendant did not raise such a challenge. His argument before the circuit court, that the city was required to prove a voluntary act as a predicate to criminal liability, was purely statutory. He relied solely on Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.095(1). Critically, defendant did not argue before the circuit court, and did not argue now, that, if the DUII ordinance did not require a conscious or voluntary act, it was unconstitutional. Defendant had not made an independent constitutional challenge to the DUII ordinance. He argued that, as a matter of statutory law, a voluntary act was an element of DUII and then argued that, as a matter of constitutional law, he had a right to have the prosecution prove that element, like all other elements, to a jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner, the apparent victim of a fraud involving her property, appealed a judgment of the Jefferson County Circuit Court (Oregon), which dismissed her complaint that sought compensation under Oregon Ballot Measure 37, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.305 (2007). The State had moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it had become moot as a result of the passage of Oregon Ballot Measure 49, which modified Measure 37.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Measure 49 altered the government's obligations with respect to reductions in property value caused by land use regulations. Evaluated under the more modern substantive due process framework--that is, whether the statute and its retroactive application had a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by rational means--the court held that Measure 49 plainly passed muster. The court rejected plaintiff's contentions that Measure 49 either (1) applied only prospectively to Measure 37 claims or (2) through retroactive application violated her right to substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The circuit court did not err in dismissing her complaint. Plaintiff could not credibly claim the legislature and the voters lacked a legitimate government purpose in rebalancing public and private land use interests under Measure 49. Nor was it irrational to accomplish that rebalancing retroactively. Given the number of Measure 37 claims that were being processed, and the potential costs of those pending claims, the legislature and the voters decided that it was in the best interest of the state to replace the remedies in all Measure 37 cases, pending and future.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Marion County Circuit Court, Oregon, denied plaintiff voters' and intervenors', organization and individual, motions for summary judgment and allowed defendants', State officials, cross-motion for summary judgment on the voters' action for declaratory and injunctive relief, seeking the implementation and enforcement of Ballot Measure 47 (2006), Or. Rev. Stat. ch. 259. The voters and intervenors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intervenors argued that Measure 47 was void in its entirety, because section 9(f) violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The appellate court concluded that &quot;shall become effective&quot; in section 9(f) referred not to the measure's enactment, but to its operation. The provision did not violate Article I, &sect; 21. The voters argued that section 9(f) violated Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1(4)(d). The appellate court found that Measure 47 was not operative and, therefore, was not void for want of constitutionality on the date of its enactment. The effective date of Measure 47 was not subject to any contingency. Measure 47 became law on December 7, 2006, pursuant to Article IV, &sect; 1(4)(d), even though section 9(f) deferred its active operation. Unless or until Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 was amended to permit compulsory limitations on campaign contributions and expenditures or the Oregon Supreme Court overruled aspects of the prior appeal, the substantive provisions in Measure 47 remained dormant. Voters considered Measure 47 reasonably understood the operative &quot;limitations&quot; in section 9(f) to be prohibitions or restrictions akin to those deemed unconstitutional in the prior case.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court was correct in determining pursuant to Or. Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property contained estuarine shore lands and wetlands. The county concluded that dredging would be permissible because the area to be affected by development activities was small to moderate in scale. The Board found that the county had inaccurately calculated the area affected and that the proposed development was not consistent with a plan requirement to protect habitat. The court held that previous unchallenged administrative rulings as to the area affected and the meaning of the word &quot;protect&quot; were controlling. The county's interpretation of the acreage of development activities, which did not include areas temporarily disturbed by construction activity or the dredged area, was inconsistent with the express language of the plan policy under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.829(1)(a). It was not enough that most of the standards in Clatsop County. Or., Land and Water Development and Use Ordinance &sect; 5.412(1), which required zoning to be consistent with the plan, were met. The Board did not err in ruling that &quot;protect&quot; as used in Goal 16 (Estuarine Resources), Or. Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case on remand from the court of appeal, plaintiff appealed a limited judgment of the Multnomah County Circuit Court (Oregon) dismissing for a third time her product liability claims against defendants. The trial court agreed with defendants that plaintiff's claims were barred by the statute of limitations in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.905(2) (2003) and did not meet the requirements of a revival statute the legislature had enacted in 2003.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that plaintiff's reliance on the law of the case doctrine was unavailing because the court did not fully consider and resolve defendants' statutory arguments in the disposition of the prior appeal. Defendants filed no responsive pleadings or motions to dismiss pursuant to Or. R. Civ. P. 21 before filing the original motion for summary judgment, and thus did not trigger the waiver provision in Or. R. Civ. P. 21 G(2). Instead, after being served with the complaint, defendants immediately sought summary judgment asserting that the statute was unconstitutional. That procedure was permissible under Or. R. Civ. P. 15 A, 47 B. The Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure did not provide, specifically, that if a summary judgment motion did not include a statute of limitations defense, that defense was waived. Accordingly, the court rejected plaintiff's argument that defendants waived the defense at issue simply by virtue of failing to include it in their original motion for summary judgment. The court was likewise unconvinced that defendants ever affirmatively represented that plaintiff's claims were properly before the court pursuant to the revival statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The telephonic harassment counts arose out of defendant's conduct in calling various county public offices. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on the five counts of telephonic harassment because there was sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant intended to harass or annoy the recipients of his calls, based on the frequency and length of defendant's calls after receiving letters forbidding him from calling, the content of those calls, and, most significantly, defendant's own testimony at trial. However, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on the count of criminal trespass in the second degree because there was insufficient evidence in the record from which a rational trier of fact could have found that defendant was &quot;lawfully directed&quot; not to enter the county public services building. Defendant had a protected liberty interest in petitioning his government for redress of grievances, and that interest was constrained by a notice of exclusion issued by the sheriff's office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer saw defendant, whom the officer apparently recognized, and decided to run a status check on him. The check revealed an outstanding warrant for defendant's arrest. When the officer ordered defendant to stop, he ran away, but the officer quickly apprehended him. Before trial, defendant requested a jury instruction that would have informed the jury that the State had to prove, among other things, that defendant knew that the officer's order was lawful. After a colloquy between the trial court and defense counsel, the trial court ruled that it would not give that instruction to the jury and would not require the State to prove that defendant knew that the officer's order to stop was lawful because the trial court did not believe that the law required that the State prove that defendant knew that the order was lawful. Because Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 162.247 was outside of the Oregon Criminal Code, and because it clearly indicated a legislative intent to dispense with a culpable mental state requirement with respect to the lawfulness of the officer's order that defendant refused to obey, trial court did not err in ruling that the State did not have to prove such a mental state.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the rule was invalid because the statute that authorized DHS to license residential care facilities, Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contacts that allegedly violated the stalking protective order both involved communicating with the person who was protected by the order, through her parents, thus implicating the contact described in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.730(3)(f), communicating with the other person through a third person. Therefore, under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.750(1)(c), the state was required to prove that the communications created a reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of a person protected by the order. The court of appeals concluded that in order to survive a challenge under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, an expressive &quot;prohibited contact,&quot; as described Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.730(3)(d), (e), (f), (h), and (i), had to contain an unequivocal threat that instilled a fear of imminent and serious personal violence and was objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts. The state failed to prove that defendant's expressive communications directed toward the father of the protected person satisfied that standard. The two letters reflected defendant's ongoing irrational and delusional belief that he had a personal relationship with the protected person but contained no threats.</SPAN></P>

The vesting determination qualified the property as subject to special zoning allowances under section 5(3) of Measure 49 (codified at Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.305).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued that there was insufficient evidence in the local government administrative record to establish vested rights under the applicable legal standards. The court held that the circuit court erred in two respects in failing to remand to the county pursuant to petitioner's writ of review. First, the circuit court should have remanded for a determination of the applicable zoning law at the time of the claimant's acquisition of the property. Because the county decision did not make findings on the acquisition zoning and the limitations of that zoning, the decision was insufficient to explain why the proposed vested uses complied with the waivers. Second, the circuit court should have remanded for the county to determine the extent and general cost of the project to be vested and to give proper weight to the expenditure ratio factor in the totality of the circumstances of the case. The county decision under review recognized the claimant's prior efforts to obtain subdivision approval and construct related improvements as sufficient to vest his right to construct nine additional houses on the property.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress and he was convicted. The court affirmed. Defendant's right to counsel argument depended on the proposition that asking one to take field sobriety tests was interrogation, but the court had already rejected the claim. Defendant argued that &sect; 815.025 was unconstitutionally vague. However, even if the statute was vague, and even if a stop based on such entitled one to suppression, which the court did not address, the testimony showed that the deputy subjectively believed that defendant was driving a vehicle in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 815.250(1). While the deputy's testimony might or might not have been sufficient to convict defendant of violating &sect; 815.250(1), it was enough to provide an objective basis for the deputy's belief that the exhaust was not in good working order.

The trial court agreed with the department that the residents were not parties to the prior proceedings, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.075(1). The residents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents argued that an affected &quot;party&quot; who may seek judicial review of an order in other than a contested case under Or.

The appellate court found that the statute provided no mechanism that enabled persons such as the residents to file a protest, to file a request for standing or a petition to intervene, or in any other way to become recognized as &quot;parties&quot; in the sense suggested by the contested case provisions. The water rights statute permitted the department to approve a request for a change to the permit without any sort of hearing in which another person could file a protest or file a request for standing or a petition to intervene. If the statute limited judicial review of orders in other than a contested case to persons who had been formally recognized as &quot;parties,&quot; but there was no process by which such recognition may be obtained, persons such as the residents could be faced with the prospect of being unable to obtain judicial review of department orders that adversely affected their property rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress. The court agreed and reversed and remanded. Although it appeared that the officer had a valid reason related to the traffic stop for asking defendant to step out of the car, as the officer intended to have it towed, that reason was not expressed to defendant or the driver when defendant was asked to step out. Also, defendant was told he was not free to leave. The officer immediately questioned defendant about the contraband, instead of pursuing inquiry related to the traffic stop. The trial court found that defendant subjectively believed that his liberty had been restricted. Given the court's finding that defendant's belief was objectively reasonable, the court, instead of having to remand the case, found that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress. There was no bright-line rule as to whether an officer's request that a person step out of a vehicle in the context of a traffic stop constituted a seizure for purposes of Or. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Commercial Fishery Permit Board of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (board) issued an amended final order in a contested case proceeding that upheld a 200 crab pot limit for petitioner fisherman's crab vessel permit. The fisherman appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fisherman argued that, by failing to consider crab landings made by his vessel in Washington between December 1, 1995, and August 14, 2001, under his Washington permit, the board erroneously interpreted Or. Admin. R. 635-006-1015(1)(g) to require that all crab landings made during the qualifying period be made by a vessel with an Oregon permit. The appellate court found that the board correctly concluded that the vessel to which the rule referred was the one that held the permit during the qualifying period. The board's interpretation of the rule was consistent with the legislature's directive to the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission to preserve Oregon's ocean Dungeness crab fishery and the Oregon industries dependent on it. Crab-pot allocations made pursuant to Or. Admin. R. 635-006-1015(1)(g)(E) applied only to Oregon-permitted vessels and, therefore, could not violate the Dungeness Crab Act's. 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1856, discrimination prohibition rule because the Oregon rule simply did not impose any crab-pot limit on out-of-state vessels.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Marion County Circuit Court, Oregon, granted summary judgment in favor of respondent state on its injunction prohibiting appellant tobacco retailer from selling, offering for sale, accepting orders, possessing for sale in Oregon or transporting, to Oregon consumers cigarettes that were not listed in the directory, contrary to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 180.440(1)(b). The retailer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that Oregon courts did have subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims at issue because the retailer's Internet websites were accessible in Oregon. The fact that he harnessed technology to venture into Oregon with offers and to convey Oregonians' orders back to New York, and then employed the mail to make his deliveries, did not change the basic nature of the transaction. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 180.440(1)(b) applied to unstamped as well as stamped cigarettes. Had the legislature intended that the directory contain only &quot;units sold,&quot; it would have required manufacturers to submit to the Attorney General a list consisting of only &quot;units sold.&quot; That was not what it did; instead, it required manufacturers to submit a list of &quot;brand families&quot; as well. &quot;In this state&quot; was broad enough to include the sales at issue. Sales of the cigarettes of nonparticipating manufacturers from an out-of-state seller to purchasers located in Oregon constituted sales &quot;in this state&quot; for purposes of &sect; 180.440(1)(b). Regulating the retailer's activities in Oregon did not violate the Commerce Clause or the Indian Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Multnomah County Circuit Court, Oregon, granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff insurers on their contribution action against defendants, the settling insurers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the trial court erred in ruling that the insurers' claims were barred by the doctrine of issue preclusion because the prior judgment did not parse out the obligation of individual insurers or purport to resolve the issue in the case. The right to equitable contribution among insurers was grounded in principles of equity and was a right that inured to the benefit of the insurers and not the insured. The settling insurers' settlements with the insured did not extinguish the insurers' right to equitable contribution for defense costs paid prior to the settlement. An equitable contribution action was not the type of action for which the legislature intended to extend a right to attorney fees. The trial court erred in ruling in favor of two of the settling insurers and against the insurers on the parties' cross-motions for partial summary judgment regarding the duty to defend. The trial court did not err in denying a settling insurer's motion for summary judgment, finding that statutory amendments to the Oregon Environmental Cleanup Assistance Act, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 465.475 to 465.480, retroactively extinguished the insurers' contribution claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a juvenile dependency case, appellant mother challenged a dispositional order of the Clackamas County Circuit Court (Oregon), arguing that requiring her to complete a polygraph regarding unexplained injuries to her three-month-old child violated her rights against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An infant sustained multiple unexplained injuries. At proceedings to determine the placement of the child, the juvenile court required the parents to complete a polygraph test to determine whether either parent caused the injuries or knew the source of those injuries. The juvenile court indicated that if the parents remained silent in response to the polygraph examiner's questions, an answer adverse to their interests would be inferred. On review of the juvenile court's dispositional order, the court held that the imposition of a requirement that the mother submit to a polygraph test violated her Fifth Amendment rights. Providing use immunity from criminal prosecution was a necessary condition to compelling potentially incriminating statements as an inducement to cooperation and disclosure during dependency proceedings. Because the juvenile court required the mother to submit to a polygraph exam without granting her use immunity, the juvenile court's order violated the mother's privilege against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispositional order was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that, because the juvenile was adjudicated to be within the jurisdiction of the Jackson County Juvenile Court, he had not been convicted of any crime or offense, and the Josephine County Circuit Court did not have authority to consider a petition for post-conviction relief under the criminal code, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 138.510 to 138.680. Even assuming that the Josephine County Circuit Court could have liberally construed the petition as a petition under Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the second count was not supported by any facts in the record and, in any event, it should be merged into the first count. The appellate court concluded that defendant was represented by counsel at the hearing, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9.380. An attorney was appointed by the court to represent defendant in an order dated November 26, 2007. Defendant did not apply to the court to have that attorney-client relationship terminated, and at no point did the attorney file his consent to its termination. Nothing in the record suggested that the trial court would not have heard an objection and argument from the attorney. Defendant's remark, &quot;So we don't have a fucking lawyer,&quot; could plausibly be considered &quot;resistance to&quot; the court's assertion that defendant did, indeed, have a lawyer. It could also be considered resistance to the court's authority. Defendant had already completed the 60-day sentence for contempt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment of the Clackamas County Circuit Court, Oregon, imposing a sentence on defendant on his conviction for murder for an offense committed in 1991. The trial court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment with immediate eligibility for parole after it determined that Oregon's sentencing guidelines were invalid on constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the trial court erred in concluding that the sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional as the product of unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch of government. It could not construe former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.115(3)(a) (1989) to have provided authority for the trial court to have imposed sentence independently of the guidelines. The legislature's delegation of authority to the state sentencing guidelines board to develop sentencing guidelines as an administrative rule was constitutionally permissible. The legislature provided standards directing the board's development of the guidelines. The legislature reserved the power to disapprove the guidelines before they would go into effect by requiring the board to submit them to the legislature prior to their effective date. Although the guidelines were created as administrative rules, the legislature gave them the authority of statutory law. Because at least two of the aggravating facts alleged by the State necessarily survived defendant's void for vagueness challenge, defendant failed to show that no departure sentence could be constitutionally applied against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mobile home park owner filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant, the City of Wilsonville, Oregon, to invalidate city ordinances that regulated the conversion of mobile home parks to other uses. The Clackamas County Circuit Court, Oregon, entered a judgment declaring that those ordinances were preempted by state law and violated the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause. The city appealed. Plaintiff cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case concerned the legality of the city's ordinances that regulated the closure of mobile home parks by requiring the park owner to obtain a closure permit from the city and to compensate displaced tenants. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 90.630(5) (2005) directed a mobile home park landlord who wished to convert the park to a different use to provide tenants with a one-year notice of termination, space for the tenant to move, and the payment of moving expenses. Because plaintiff's legal interests were affected by the ordinance, the trial court did not err in holding plaintiff's preemption claim to be justiciable. The Court of Appeals of Oregon held that the trial court erred in determining that the ordinances violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The ordinances bore a reasonable relation a legitimate governmental interest aimed at providing assistance to those seeking affordable housing. The ordinances did not have any retroactive active effect. While the ordinances imposed greater requirements on owners of mobile home parks than mandated by the Oregon Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, Or. Rev. Stat. ch. 90, they were not preempted by state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general judgment was reversed on appeal and on cross-appeal; the supplemental judgment for costs and attorney fees was vacated. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings on plaintiff's other claims for relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to three counts of abuse of a memorial, in violation of Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court concluded that the requirements of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.067(3), the anti-merger statute, were not met but that it was only the sentences that merged, not the convictions, and therefore entered judgment for three separate convictions, but imposed concurrent sentences. The court found that failure to merge the convictions was error because &sect; 161.067(3) pertained to the number of separately punishable offenses, not to whether sentences should be imposed consecutively or concurrently. The judgment was appealable under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.050(1) because the argument regarding the erroneous entry of three separate convictions was an argument that the disposition exceeded the maximum allowable by law. Further, the issue would have been properly preserved for review, even if, as the prosecution alleged, it had not been raised until after defendant pled guilty. The time to address a merger claim was postverdict, not at or before a plea hearing, or during trial. The court declined to consider, as an alternative basis for affirming the failure to merge, whether there was a sufficient pause to justify the separate convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case with instruction to merge the three counts of abuse of a memorial into one and for resentencing. The court otherwise affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Deschutes County Circuit Court (Oregon) that imposed a sentence of 180 months in prison for his convictions of five counts of second-degree sexual abuse under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.425 and five counts of incest under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.525, arguing that the sentence was unconstitutionally disproportionate under Or. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant met his daughter, the victim, when she was 16 years old. She moved into defendant's home and engaged in sexual intercourse with defendant on numerous occasions when she was 17 and 18 years old. As a result, the victim became pregnant and gave birth to defendant's child. Defendant was indicted on 21 counts of sexual abuse and 54 counts of incest, but he pled guilty to five counts of each offense and stipulated that each count was a separate and distinct act that could be sentenced consecutively. On review of the sentence imposed, the court held that defendant's sentence was proportionate to his offenses. Defendant admitted that he had sexual intercourse with his minor daughter on five separate occasions and continued that relationship after she reached the age of majority. Defendant's conduct persisted even after the police notified him that they were investigating the sexual relationship. Moreover, defendant had a history of second-degree sexual abuse apart of his relationship with his daughter because he had previously impregnated another minor. This was not a rare case where the penalty imposed violated the constitutional prohibition against disproportionate sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient sued defendants, the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), two doctors, and a medical group. The jury found that one of the doctors was negligent. The Multnomah County Circuit Court, Oregon, entered judgment a $ 1,412,000 for plaintiff, held that OHSU's liability was capped at $200,000, denied the medical group's motion to cap its liability at $200,000, and refused to dismiss the negligent doctor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was injured as the result of treatment he received while a patient at OHSU. He brought an action against two of his physicians, OHSU, and OHSU medical group. The trial court found that one of the doctor's negligence caused plaintiff to suffer $ 1,412,000 in damages. Pursuant to the Oregon Tort Claims Act (OTCA), OHSU's liability was limited to $ 200,000. The trial court erred in denying the medical group's motion to limit its liability to $ 200,000 pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(1). The medical group functioned as an instrument of the state and was a public body. The Court of Appeals of Oregon held that Or. Const. art.

The appellate court found that the sentence that defendant received did not present a circumstance in which a disproportionate punishment required reversal. The conduct for which defendant was convicted was as grave as any listed in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.375(1)(b). Considering only the offense that defendant committed and the penalty that he received, his sentence did not shock the moral sense of reasonable people. The penalty for first-degree rape was not harsher than the penalty for murder. The term of post-prison supervision was a constitutionally permissible, proportionate response by the legislature to the seriousness of the offense and vulnerability of the victim involved in the case. Defendant committed a grave offense and received a severe penalty. His sentence would not violate the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Deschutes County Circuit Court, Oregon, allowed defendant's demurrers to three charges: causing another person to ingest a controlled substance, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.908 (2005); unlawful application of a controlled substance to a minor, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.910 (2005); and recklessly endangering another person, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.195. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court concluded that it could not decide the issues concerning Counts 1 and 2 on the basis that the parties argued in the trial court and continued to argue on appeal. Neither party cited Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.630 or asserted that it was inappropriate for the court to consider, in ruling on defendant's demurrer, facts other than those appearing on the face of the indictment. No cognizable exception to the invited error doctrine applied. Because the trial court's decision on the merits of the demurrer did not create a jurisdictional problem, there was no basis for the appellate court to reverse the decision of the trial court. The State was not in a position to obtain reversal on Counts 1 and 2. Because a conviction under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.195 required a defendant to have engaged in conduct that, at the time of engaging in the conduct, created a risk of serious injury to &quot;another person,&quot; the indictment in the case failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute that crime. There was no person in existence who could be harmed as a fetus was not a &quot;person.&quot; Defendant had a fundamental right to decide whether to become pregnant or to carry her pregnancy to term.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted the petitioner of sexual abuse in the first degree. At sentencing, the State requested the imposition of a life sentence under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.719. The petitioner had a prior record dating back to the imposition of probation in 1967 by a California court. The petitioner argued that he was entitled to relief because his trial counsel provided constitutionally inadequate assistance under: Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11; U.S. Const. amend. VI; and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The appellate court concluded that the petitioner's 1967 probation was not classified as a sentence was not classified as a sentence at the time it was ordered. Thus, the 1967 probation was not a predicate &quot;sentence&quot; within the meaning of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.719. The petitioner had only one prior sentence for a felony sex crime at the time of sentencing; therefore, the presumptive sentence of life imprisonment under &sect; 137.719 did not apply. Had his counsel raised the argument at sentencing, the petitioner would have received a shorter sentence. The petitioner showed that he suffered prejudice as a result of his counsel's deficiencies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendants contended the State's proof was legally insufficient to establish that either of them intentionally or knowingly withheld necessary and adequate physical care from any of their children, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.205(1)(a). The appellate court disagreed, concluding that the State presented legally sufficient proof, specifically with respect to each defendant's failure to rectify choking hazards in the home, to establish that each defendant violated &sect; 163.205(1)(a). The evidence showed more than mere incidental or isolated exposure; the hazard was not only potentially lethal and immediate, but also relatively pervasive and temporally durable and persistent. The trier of fact could have reasonably inferred that there were multiple choking hazards easily accessible to children for an extended period of time and that defendants, notwithstanding their awareness of the attendant risk, had done little, if anything, to rectify that condition. Further, the evidence demonstrated that the likelihood of harm was real, and not merely hypothetical as the two-year-old child tried to put one of the choking hazards into his mouth while an officer was present.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendants contended Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 164.887 violated both the state and federal constitutions, that it granted an immunity from prosecution to one class of citizens (those who were involved in a labor dispute), and the immunity did not equally belong to all citizens. The appellate court disagreed in part, finding that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 164.887 expressly restrained only conduct: obstructing, impairing, or hindering specified agricultural operations (or attempting to do so), it did not expressly prohibit speaking, writing, printing, or assembling, although those activities may accompany the prohibited conduct. As such, defendants' facial challenges under Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8, 26 failed. However, the appellate court agreed that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 164.887 violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend XIV as it imposed criminal penalties on persons who engaged in picketing, but created an exception for persons who were involved in a labor protest; this distinction had no bearing on any legitimate governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor and the corporation entered into an agreement with the shipping company to pick up and deliver packages on behalf of the shipping company. The shipping company's arguments on appeal concerned the award of punitive damages. The appellate court concluded that the jury's award of punitive damages was based solely on its finding in the contractor's and corporation's favor on the claims for intentional interference and fraud. The trial court erred in denying the shipping company's motion for a directed verdict on the intentional interference with economic relations claim because there was no evidence in the record that would support a finding that the shipping company was a third party to any of the contractor's and corporation's economic relationships. The trial court did not err in denying the shipping company's motion for a directed verdict on the fraud claim because the contractor's and corporation's reliance on promises were not unreasonable as a matter of law. Finally, the jury's award of punitive damages exceeded the amounts that were constitutionally permissible under the Due Process Clause because the judgment was 20 times the actual and potential damages.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed, finding that the relevancy and scope of Salem, Or., Revised Code &sect; 63.065 was raised by the parties before the local hearings body under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.835(3) and was not a &quot;new issue&quot; under Or. Rev.

Further, the tentative partition plan denial was outside the range of discretion allowed to the City Council because the partition application met the applicable standards. The City's justification was substantively wrong as the code provision did not provide a basis for denying an already-processed partition request. That substantive error pertained to the merits of the decision, and not to the manner in which the limited land use decision was adjudicated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Multnomah County Circuit Court (Oregon) that convicted him, under a conditional plea, of driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII) in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 813.010, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of his blood alcohol content after he consented to a blood draw because the blood draw was obtained in violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was transported to a hospital emergency room after being involved in a one-car accident. A police officer arrived, awakened defendant, placed him under arrest for DUII and reckless driving, and read the implied consent law, including the consequences of refusing to submit to blood alcohol testing. Defendant agreed to submit. On review, the court agreed that defendant's consent was not voluntarily given. Defendant's consent was procured through a threat of economic harm and the loss of driving privileges and was obtained only after being given the warnings required by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 813.130(2) regarding the consequences of refusing to submit to a blood test. In addition, defendant had just been arrested, had been injured in a car accident, and was under the influence of an intoxicant. These factors, when considered together, led to conclusions that defendant's consent was not voluntary under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, and that the trial court erred in denying his suppression motion. Further, because the State failed to establish exigent circumstances to justify the warrantless seizure of defendant's blood, the motion to suppress was improperly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, retired Oregon Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) members, sought review of a final order of respondent Oregon Public Employees Retirement Board (PERB) that denied their requests to change their retirement allowances and remove their designated beneficiaries because Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 238.305(6) provided that a retired PERS member could change his or her retirement allowances only in situations involving death or divorce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon retirement, petitioners had designated their same-sex domestic partners as their beneficiaries, and because Oregon law did not allow petitioners to marry their same-sex domestic partners, they were unable to divorce their domestic partners when their relationships ended. At issue was whether PERB properly denied petitioners' attempt to exercise the pop-up election under &sect; 238.305(6). The court found that PERB's failure to find that PERS would lose its tax-qualified status if it permitted petitioners' elections rendered its reasoning legally defective. That failure to make the finding required by &sect; 238.305(10) before exercising discretion under the statute was not a matter of mere semantics. Under PERB's reasoning, petitioners were denied a remedy that might otherwise be available to them--benefits that resulted from their exercise of the option under &sect; 238.305(6). The availability of the remedy sought by petitioners before PERB depended on whether the legislature would have intended that remedy in the event that it had contemplated the unconstitutionality of the application of &sect; 238.305(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the matter to PERB for reconsideration. On remand, if PERB continued to assume that &sect; 238.305(6) was unconstitutional as applied to petitioners, then it had to determine whether the requirements of &sect; 238.305(10) were satisfied before it could exercise the discretion conferred on it by the legislature and conclude that petitioners were not entitled to the remedy they sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Marion County Circuit Court, Oregon, denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence and convicted him for delivery of a Schedule I controlled substance, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.840(1). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, was violated when defendant was questioned during a traffic stop about matters unrelated to the stop, thereby prolonging the stop without reasonable suspicion of further criminal activity. As a result of that unlawful questioning, defendant's backpack was confiscated and searched; the evidence from that search should have been suppressed. There was insufficient evidence that the traffic stop had ended before the officer questioned defendant about drugs and weapons, and asked what would be discovered by a dog search, because there was no evidence that defendant was told that he was free to leave, according to the officer the time between the warning and renewed interrogation was 10 to 15 seconds, and there was no friendly conversation that preceded the official inquiries. The court also held that sufficient evidence corroborated defendant's admission that he was delivering marijuana to his son at a party because an officer discovered two baggies of marijuana in defendant's backpack and a reasonable inference could be drawn that the smaller amount of marijuana was for personal consumption and that the larger amount was for delivery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury of the Umatilla County Circuit Court, Oregon, found defendant guilty of possession of methamphetamine. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that her right to confront and cross-examine witnesses was violated by the admission of an Oregon State Police crime laboratory report without producing the author of the report. The reviewing court held that the error under the Sixth Amendment and Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, was harmless because there was other evidence as to the nature of the substance. An officer with 14 years experience, including extensive training in drug recognition, recognized the contents of the vial as methamphetamine and testified that the substance was hidden in defendant's bra and that she admitted that the substance was contraband. The crime laboratory report was cumulative, and the state's case was strong. Further, defendant's theory at trial was that she did not know that she possessed methamphetamine. Aside from an undeveloped challenge in closing argument, she did not seriously dispute whether the substance in the vial was methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>
