</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that defendant constructed a dwelling without a permit and that he extended or enlarged a private sewage disposal system without a permit. On appeal, the court found that the definition of dwelling contained in Burnett County, Wis., Land Use Ordinance &sect; 2.1(8) did not encompass defendant's building, because the building was not designed or used exclusively as living quarters. It was inappropriate to find that defendant had constructed a dwelling without a permit. That judgment was reversed. Defendant did violate the sanitary ordinance, Burnett County, Wis., Sanitary Ordinance &sect; I.A.5, by connecting the garage's plumbing to an existing septic system without a sanitary permit. The ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave fair notice of its requirements and provided an objective standard for its enforcement. That judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed in part; defendant needed a sanitary permit to connect the garage plumbing to the existing septic system, and the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. Judgment reversed in part; defendant's garage was not a dwelling, as such, defendant did not violate an ordinance by failing to obtain a permit to construct a dwelling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case was based on appellant daughter's filing of a petition for guardianship of appellant mother, which was later converted to a conservatorship. Appellant mother challenged the trial court's judgment and orders approving the final account and requiring respondent conservatorship to pay attorney fees, arguing that respondent temporary guardian was not entitled to attorney fees because her appointment did not comply with statutory procedure. Appellant daughter and appellant son challenged the trial court's assessment of remedial sanctions for contempt, arguing that they were improperly found in contempt. The court affirmed the trial court. The court held that the procedure set out in Wis. Stat. &sect; 880.15 allowed for the appointment of a temporary guardian without advance notice to appellant mother. The court also held that to argue that the facts did not support the underlying contempt order was not a defense to appellant daughter's and appellant son's contempt proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of first degree intentional homicide, armed robbery, burglary, arson, and conspiracy to manufacture or deliver drugs. Defendant argued that: 1) he was denied his right to a speedy trial; 2) denial of his adjournment motion and exclusion of evidence constituted error; 3) he had ineffective assistance of counsel; 4) his parole eligibility date was wrongly fixed; and 5) restitution was erroneously determined. The court held that defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial since he never objected to any continuances, never asserted his right to a speedy trial, nor showed how he was prejudiced by the delay. The prompt and efficient administration of justice warranted denial of defendant's adjournment motion and cumulative evidence was properly excluded. Defendant failed to show how his counsel's performance was deficient or prejudicial. The trial court properly considered the gravity of the offense, defendant's rehabilitative needs, and the public interest in determining defendant's sentence and parole eligibility date. The restitution order was proper since defendant failed to object to the restitution amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; defendant failed to timely object to restitution amount and was not denied right to speedy trial or effective legal assistance since he failed to object to continuances or show how his counsel's performance was deficient or prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers noticed defendant walking in a roadway at night and stopped defendant and asked for identification. Based on defendant's nervous mannerisms, police frisked defendant and found drug paraphernalia and marijuana. Defendant was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of Wis.

The trial court granted defendant's motion. The State argued that the stop and frisk was authorized under the Terry doctrine. On appeal, the court affirmed the motion to suppress, holding that the stop and frisk was unconstitutional because the officers lacked reasonable suspicion that defendant was armed and dangerous. The fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine prevented the State from using evidence obtained as a result of an unconstitutional search. The court held that the trial court's factual determinations supported its constitutional conclusions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Iowa County (Wisconsin) denying his motion to suppress evidence and convicting him of possession of firearms by a felon, possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, and doing business as an unlicensed salvage dealer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stated purpose of the search was to uncover evidence that appellant was operating an unlicensed salvage business, possibly involving stolen vehicles and vehicle parts. In the ensuing search, police officers seized a number of firearms from the main house, 193 grams of marijuana found mainly in the trailer, drug paraphernalia, numerous vehicle titles, and numerous junk cars. Evidence of a large number of junked vehicles on appellant's premises, his frequent sales of the vehicles, and his sale of at least one auto part on the premises, provided probable cause to believe that objects linked to unlawful salvage operations were likely to be found on the premises. Therefore, the warrant application provided probable cause to issue the warrant. One could reasonably infer that evidence of the operation included various documents. The warrant expressly authorized a search inside the buildings on the property. Therefore, search of the premises was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; evidence of numerous junked vehicles, frequent sale of vehicles, and sale of a part was sufficient probable cause that appellant operated an unlawful salvage operation to issue a search warrant. Search of premises was appropriate because that was where documents would be found and warrant expressly authorized search.</SPAN></P>

A litigant's right to initiate suit in forma pauperis, which did not implicate a fundamental right, stemmed from a legislatively created privilege, not a constitutionally guaranteed right. The court did not decide which result would be proper for an as-applied challenge by an inmate seeking to litigate a fundamental right not specifically excluded from the definition of a prisoner. The court concluded the legislature's decision not to extend the privilege of proceeding without the prepayment of fees to petitioner, based on his status as a prisoner and his history of frivolous litigation, did not violate his constitutional right to court access.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the judgment terminating their parental rights to their children. The court affirmed. It was clear that appellant mother was being deprived of a fundamental right and, as a consequence, the State was required to show both a compelling interest in the deprivation of the right and a narrowly tailored infringement to serve the State's interest, which the State did show. The court disagreed with appellant mother's argument that it was unlawful to apply the statute retroactively. In light of the trial court's findings regarding appellant father, and under the facts presented, the trial court properly exercised its rights in making the decision to terminate appellant father's rights, as it was in children's best interest. The court affirmed the orders of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Statute under which State proceeded to terminate parental rights was not unconstitutional as it served compelling State interest and was narrowly tailored. Application of statute retroactively did not violate ex post facto laws. Termination of appellants' parental rights were in best interest of children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court rejected appellant's arguments, and it affirmed order revoking appellant's operating privileges for one year. The court concluded that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague.

However, the court found a state court could not deprive a party from obtaining a determination in federal court of the application of a federal remedy; thus defendant could proceed in federal court to have the federal court determine the application of federal law to its petition to compel arbitration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, involuntarily committed for treatment for being a sexually violent person, participated in a disturbance involving several patients.

Using their education and collective experience, appellees determined that appellant's treatment and the safe and efficient operation of the facility would best be achieved by permanently reassigning appellant to the high management unit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, trust and trustees, owned property adjacent to defendant neighbor who constructed a retention pond on his property. Defendant neighbor applied for a permit after the pond was constructed. Plaintiffs objected, arguing that defendant Department of Natural Resources (DNR) lacked subject matter jurisdiction necessary to issue the after-the-fact permit and that they were denied the use of their land without due process of law. The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court which granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. Based upon the interpretation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.19, the appellant court determined that the DNR had subject matter jurisdiction to issue after-the-fact permits. Plaintiffs were not denied the use of their property without due process because the building of the retention pond was not a property interest taken by an agency or the state and plaintiffs could not show that the process they received was constitutionally inadequate.</SPAN></P>

At trial, defendant was convicted for erecting an unauthorized sign within highway limits, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 86.19(3). On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred by finding a violation because &sect; 86.19 regulated permanently fixed roadside signs and he was holding an unattached sign, and the statute impermissibly limited his U.S. Const. amend. I right of expression. The judgment of conviction was affirmed because the manner in which the defendant used the sign fell within the construction and interpretation of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested in a parking lot of a four-unit apartment complex and charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. On a motion to dismiss, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.61, claiming it violated the Equal Protection Clause. The trial court decided that &sect; 346.61 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause and defendant appealed. The court agreed with the trial court and affirmed. The court found that &sect; 346.61 met the rational basis test. The legislature could reasonably conclude that operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated was more of a safety hazard on a parking lot of rental housing with four or more units than on the parking lot of rental housing with fewer units, or on the parking lot for a residence that was not rental housing. The state had a legitimate interest in protecting persons from injury by intoxicated drivers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a 15-year-old, shot and killed his father's roommate. Appellant contested several rulings of the trial court. The court found that polygraph evidence was properly excluded from a suppression hearing because appellant relied on authority that pertained to parole issues, not criminal proceedings. A custodial statement was properly admitted where appellant did nothing more than allege improper police conduct and later gave an inculpatory statement to other officers. A self-defense instruction was properly excluded where appellant confronted his intended robbery victim with a gun and announced that he wanted the victim's money. Appellant could not challenge statutes governing juvenile disposition on vagueness grounds because they governed procedure and did not prohibit specific conduct. Finally, appellant's adult sentence was proper where the trial court contemplated appellant's background, recognizing appellant was an &quot;angry young boy&quot; whose father had a drug problem and mother had psychological problems.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction affirmed because polygraph evidence was properly excluded, there was no factual basis to support giving a self-defense instructions to the jury, and an adult sentence for the juvenile appellant was properly considered and applied.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that his stop by the officer was unreasonable and unlawful. The court concluded that the U.S. Const. amend. IV &quot;community caretaker&quot; exception was applicable. A Fourth Amendment seizure of defendant did occur. The officer was involved in a bona fide community caretaker activity that could have focused on either assisting the vehicle's operator or, if necessary, protecting the marina property. The inconvenience of a motorist rolling down his or her vehicle window and answering an officer's inquiry under the circumstances described by the officer here was far outweighed by the benefit to the motorist who needed assistance or to the security of the area. The officer's actions leading to defendant's arrest and conviction did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment protections against unlawful seizure.</SPAN></P>

The court found the Hansford standard was not applied retroactively where a defendant failed to raise the issue at trial. The court rejected the argument defendant's counsel was ineffective for failure to object to six jurors in light of knowledge that the Hansford standard was then being decided.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant appealed from a judgment of the circuit court for Marathon County (Wisconsin), convicting him of kidnapping and false imprisonment, while using a dangerous weapon, and denying defendant sentence credit for the time spent in custody on murder charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant's prosecution for kidnapping and false imprisonment was not barred by double jeopardy due to his previous acquittal of murdering the victim because the jury in the murder trial had not necessarily found that he had not abducted the victim. Because it did not rest on a theory that the previous jury may have rejected, reversal of the conviction was unwarranted on that ground. Evidence from the murder trial was not barred by double jeopardy issue preclusion and was properly admitted to show identity, opportunity and context. Probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, or wasting time. Given limiting instructions to the jury regarding use of the evidence, its admission comported with due process fundamental fairness guarantees. The defendant was not entitled to sentence credit for time spent in custody on murder charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction and sentence affirmed. The defendant's prosecution was not barred by double jeopardy principles. Evidence from a previous murder trial was properly admitted, and admission of the evidence comported with due process guarantees. The defendant was not entitled to sentence credit for time spent in custody on murder charges.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed holding that defendant was not entitled to a new trial because she failed to object to the six-person jury at or before trial. The court further held that the trial court did not err when it excluded the blood alcohol concentration wheel because it was not relevant. The court dismissed defendant's claim regarding her prior OMVWI conviction as moot.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 343.305(4) was read to him, and he consented to a chemical test of his breath. Defendant was found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. On appeal, defendant contended the implied consent law was unconstitutional in that it under-informed accused individuals about the consequences of submitting to a chemical test while over-informing them of consequences for refusing a chemical test. The court rejected defendant's contention. Although a chemical test subject must be correctly apprised of the consequences of refusing to submit to chemical testing, informing defendant that he could lose his driving privilege by refusing the chemical test was sufficient to satisfy due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tort victim and his wife sued defendant designer alleging injuries caused by defendant's negligent and unlawful design of a ladder installed on a hospital building. Defendant moved for summary judgment, contending that the 10-year statute of repose set forth in Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.89 (1997-98) barred the claim. The trial court granted summary judgment. On appeal, plaintiffs contended that the statute of repose violated Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and the due process clause of the United States Constitution. The court found the case law concerning the constitutionality of statutes of repose contains contradictory results and this case provided an opportunity for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to harmonize, distinguish or withdraw possible conflicting language. Thus, the court certified the appeal to the supreme court to resolve the lack of consistency in the case law concerning the application of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 to statutes of repose.</SPAN></P>
