</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners brought an action against public entities and individuals, challenging Art. VII, &sect; 4(c), Fla. Const. and the statutes enacted to implement that provision. The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) entered a final order upholding the constitutional provision. The property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public entities and individuals argued that the trial court should have dismissed the case pursuant to &sect; 194.171, Fla. Stat. The appellate court disagreed. The point of the case was that the Florida property tax scheme had a discriminatory effect on nonresidents. The case had nothing to do with the assessment made on any particular property, and so the 60-day provision in &sect; 194.171 and the policy considerations underlying the statute did not come into play. The property owners asserted a series of federal constitutional challenges to Art. VII, &sect; 4(c), Fla. Const., but all of the supporting arguments had been rejected before in comparable cases. A Florida resident who owned vacation or business property in the state was not entitled to a tax benefit under Art. VII, &sect; 4(c), Fla. Const. and was in the same position with respect to that property as a nonresident. Art. VII, &sect; 4(c), Fla. Const. was valid under the United States Constitution and did not violate a nonresident's rights under the Equal Protection Clause, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, or the Commerce Clause. Likewise, &sect; 193.155, Fla. Stat. was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a drug manufacturer, challenged the order of the Division of Administrative Hearings, which entered a summary final order in a rule challenge proceeding brought by appellee, a manufacturer of a competing generic drug, and held that Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 64B16-27.500(6), which was part of the negative drug formulary (NDF) rule established under &sect; 465.025(6), Fla. Stat. (2007), was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant manufactured a levothyroxine sodium (LS) drug product, Synthroid(R), and appellee manufactured a competing generic drug. The NDF listed LS, and the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) determined that the rule was invalid on the grounds that it constituted an invalid exercise of legislative delegated authority because it conflicted with the provisions of &sect; 465.0251(1), Fla. Stat. (2007), which removed a generic drug from the NDF if the generic drug was &quot;A&quot; rated as therapeutically equivalent to a reference listed drug as referred to in the Orange Book published the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The ALJ's order, in effect, removed LS from the NDF and permitted Florida pharmacists to substitute appellee's generic LS product for a prescription for Synthroid(R) or any other &quot;A&quot; rated LS drug product. The court held that the ALJ erred in interpreting &sect; 465.0251(1) to apply to editions of the Orange Book subsequent to the date of the 2001 enactment of the statute. Therefore, the court revered the order. The court further rejected appellee's contention that appellant lacked standing to bring the appeal and that the mootness doctrine applied to the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court reversed the order and remanded the case to the ALJ for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner medical center sought a writ of certiorari seeking to quash an order of the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), which denied its objections to respondent personal representative's discovery requests pursuant to Art. X, &sect; 25, Fla. Const. (Amendment 7) for incident reports for a decedent's fall and all adverse medical incident reports involving falls of patients under &quot;fall precautions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent fell from a hospital bed while an inpatient at the medical center and subsequently died. The medical center objected to the representative's discovery requests. The court of appeal held that the trial court's order denying the medical center's objections to the discovery requests for Amendment 7 material did not depart from the essential requirements of law. A request for Amendment 7 materials was not an ordinary discovery request that could be subjected to overbreadth, irrelevance, or burdensomeness objections. The trial court did not fail to consider or rule on the medical center's claim of procedural protections under &sect; 381.028, Fla. Stat. (2008). The decedent's estate offered to work with the medical center and make necessary compromises in order to facilitate the discovery it sought. The estate did not contest the requirement that it had to pay the reasonable costs associated with the discovery before production. The medical center had not been required to produce the materials prior to payment. The Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11101 et seq., did not require the states to provide confidentiality for peer review materials.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal denied the petition.</SPAN></P>

In dismissing the grandparents' appeal, the appellate court noted that the case actually involved an attempt to change custody of the child postdisposition under &sect; 39.522, Fla. Stat., and the grandparents could not even demonstrate that any interested party filed a petition to change custody under that statute. As to the father's appeal, the appellate court held that the orders entered in dependency proceedings after the entry of the order adjudicating dependency and before an order terminating supervision or jurisdiction were not appealable pursuant to Fla. R. App. P. 9.130(a)(4). While such order could be challenged by common law certiorari when appropriate, the father argued nothing that would have suggested that certiorari would provide a possible remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida) found defendant, a juvenile, guilty of resisting arrest without violence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of dismissal because the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to supporting the finding of guilt. Defendant argued that the deputy named in the petition was not engaged in the lawful execution of a lawful duty, but rather, was merely on duty when he assisted another deputy in walking defendant to the patrol care. Defendant asserted that he was subjected to an illegal stop and arrest for mere speech. While the State argued that the deputy could have lawfully taken defendant into custody for violating three separate statutes, the appellate court concluded that there was no evidence that the deputies had been called to a disturbance and thus, defendant was not interfering with their investigation, defendant's encouraging others not to run away could not support an arrest for inciting a riot, and defendant's failure to stop yelling could not support an arrest for refusal to aid police officers who told him to stop yelling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent patient brought a medical malpractice action against petitioner eye clinic in the Circuit Court for Seminole County (Florida). The trial court ordered the eye clinic to produce in discovery incident reports concerning complaints of infections and related investigations at the eye clinic over a period of time. The eye clinic filed a petition for certiorari review of the discovery order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the course of discovery in the medical malpractice action the patient served a request for production of documents seeking, inter alia, incident reports concerning complaints of infections and related investigations at the eye clinic over a period of time. The eye clinic objected to the discovery on the bases of work-product and attorney-client privilege. It also contended that the information sought was overly broad, not limited to a reasonable time, and would have been unduly burdensome to obtain. On appeal, the court found that the adverse incident reports in question were never reviewed by counsel. Thus, the reports were not attorney work product as they did not contain any attorney's mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or theories concerning the eye clinic's case. In any event, to the extent that the reports truly were created in anticipation of litigation, they still did not amount to anything more than fact work product due to their failure to contain any mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or theories of defense counsel. In any event, a fact work-product privilege was unavailable under Art. X, &sect; 25, Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Orange County, Florida Citizen's Review Board (CRB) filed an action in the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), to enforce a subpoena. Appellant sheriff filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and supplemental relief to challenge the CRB's authority to independently investigate a complaint against a sheriff's deputy. The court held that the CRB was authorized to independently investigate the complaint. The sheriff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Orange County, Florida Charter and ordinances establishes the CRB and authorized it to review and investigate citizen complaints of excessive force and abuse of power. The sheriff challenged the CRB's power to compel the sheriff's deputies to appear and testify in CRB investigations by subpoena. On appeal, the court found that, pursuant to &sect; 112.533(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2008), and Art. VIII, &sect; 1(d), Fla. Const., the county could not interfere with the sheriff's independent exercise of his duty to investigate alleged misconduct by his deputies either by forcing him to appoint members to the CRB or by mandating his participation in CRB proceedings, either in person or through his deputies or employees. Therefore, the basic structure or composition of the CRB was constitutionally infirm. Further, those provisions of the charter and ordinance authorizing the CRB to compel the attendance of Sheriff's employees to appear for questioning by the CRB, or to produce documents, are also unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Department of Health, Board of Medicine (Florida), entered a final decision in a physician disciplinary case that adopted an administrative complaint as the Board's findings of fact and conclusions of law, and determined that appellant orthopedic surgeon's conduct in performing a wrong-site procedure violated statutory law. The surgeon appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department filed an administrative complaint with the Board against the surgeon alleging that the surgeon, by performing a surgical procedure on a patient's vertebra level rather that was not the intended level, violated &sect; 456.072(1)(aa), Fla. Stat. (2004) by performing a wrong-site procedure. According to the administrative record, the surgeon immediately notified the patient and the patient did not suffer any harm. The surgeon filed an election of rights indicating that he did not dispute the Department's allegations of fact, but requested an informal hearing before the Board to submit mitigation evidence. Following a hearing, the Board voted to accept the administrative complaint's legal conclusion that the surgeon violated the statute by performing a wrong-site procedure. The Board then entered a decision that imposed discipline. The appellate court rejected the surgeon's contention that the statute contained an irrebutable presumption that performing such a procedure fell below the standard of care and, thus, violated his due process rights because the statute had no such presumption and did not place the issue of a violation of the standard of care at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee department of children and families (DCF) filed a petition for termination of parental rights against appellant father. The petition was filed on an expedited basis pursuant to &sect; 39.806(3), Fla. Stat. (2007). The Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida), inter alia, terminated the father's parental rights to his son. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father first argued that the definition of &quot;abandonment&quot; in &sect; 39.01, Fla. Stat. (2007) was unconstitutionally vague. However, the appellate court had rejected a similar vagueness challenge in a different case. The father was not offered a case plan for reunification before initiation of this termination proceeding. The father was offered a case plan in an earlier case, but he refused it, proceeded to hearing, and was found to be non-offending. The trial court's order that the father submit to a substance abuse evaluation and drug screens was not a case plan. The father had not received DCF's services since the original case plan in 2002, and he was never offered a case plan with services as an alternative to losing his parental rights in the current proceedings. Thus, the DCF failed to prove that it could forego intermediate efforts at reunification. This was not a case of egregious abuse or danger to the child. There was evidence of a bond between the child and the father. The DCF failed to prove that termination was the least restrictive means of protecting the child from harm, which was required in a &sect; 39.806(1) proceeding. The trial court erred in entering the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The deputy retrieved the child and too the child to the address provided by the school. The child told the deputy that his parents were or should be home. The child invited the deputy into his house, where they found the door to the master bedroom locked but no answer when the deputy knocked. The deputy opened the door. On appeal, defendant argued that law enforcement's warrantless entry into his home and the subsequent seizure of cocaine and drug paraphernalia were improper. The appellate court agreed. The State offered no evidence to demonstrate a reasonable belief that the child's parents were inside the house and might be in need of medical attention. There was no indication of foul play and no car in the driveway. The deputy's alleged concern for the well-being of the parents after he entered the house and found the locked master bedroom was insufficient to justify the warrantless entry. The appellate court also concluded that the record failed to establish that the child could validly consent to entry of the locked master bedroom.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the father and the paternal grandparents of a minor child, sought review of an order entered by the Circuit Court for Pasco County, Florida, in dependency proceedings regarding the child. The order, entered by the trial court after adjudicating the child dependent, maintained the child's placement with a licensed foster care family and rejected the grandparents' request for the court to transfer placement to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court declined to reverse or quash the challenged order, finding that it had no appellate jurisdiction over what was a nonfinal order and no basis to grant relief as a matter of common law certiorari. The grandparents were not parties in the dependency proceeding and therefore, they lacked standing to appeal the order. While, the appellate court would not rule out the possibility that grandparents might have legal rights sufficient to maintain a petition for writ of certiorari, the facts in the instant case did not support such a right in the instant case. As to the father, while the order adjudicating dependency was appealable as a final order under &sect;39.510, Fla. Stat. (2007), the statute could not authorize appeals of non-final orders such as the instant order. The appellate court further held that orders entered in dependency proceedings after the entry of an adjudication order and before an order terminating supervision or jurisdiction were not appealable pursuant to Fla. R. App. P. 9.130(a)(4). Finally, while such orders could be challenged by common law certiorari, the father had argued nothing that would suggest that certiorari would provide a remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the successor trustee of two trusts, appealed a final judgment of the Circuit Court for Walton County, Florida, entered in favor of appellee county on claims that included inverse condemnation. The appellate court reversed, but the trustee filed motions, inter alia, for rehearing, clarification, and certification. The appellate court granted clarification only so that it could clarify that two separate takings occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inverse condemnation claim involved the county's diversion of water across a portion of property originally purchased by the trustee's deceased parents. Before the parents purchased the property in 1988, a ditch draining a lake's outflow had been stabilized and did not discharge water across the property. That drainage was not changed until the county acted in 1995, diverting waters across the property to alleviate flooding of other properties that was caused by a hurricane. Efforts to thereafter restabilize the water flow failed. In 2004, the county successfully redirected water flow away from the property, but in 2005, under emergency conditions, the county again diverted flow over the property. The continued flow constituted a taking. The county could not choose to act and protect the property of one owner by diverting floodwater onto the subject property without compensation to the trustee. Further, while &sect; 252.43(6), Fla. Stat. allowed the county to act in an emergency, that did not preclude the trustee, as an innocent property owner from initiating her takings claim. The statute could not restrict the rights granted to the trustee under Art. X, &sect; 6, Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed as to all issues except the inverse condemnation claims. With regard to those claims, the appellate court reversed and remanded with directions that judgment be entered in favor of the trustee on those claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded no contest in the Circuit Court for Pasco County (Florida) to possession of marijuana in excess of 20 grams, reserving the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress evidence. Following the conviction, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officer testified that he was on resource patrol in a wildlife management area when he saw defendant's pickup truck, near a river, backing away. The officer stopped the truck to conduct a resource inspection. As the officer approached the truck, he smelled marijuana. Defendant and a passenger admitted to having smoked marijuana earlier. The officer found a bag of marijuana in a search of the truck. On cross-examination, the officer indicated that he did not observe defendant participating in any regulated activities. He also had no reason to believe that defendant was involved in criminal activity or violating traffic laws. The officer believed he had the authority to detain anyone for a regulatory inspection in the wildlife management area. On appeal, the court found that the officer needed reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's truck under &sect; 372.07, Fla. Stat. (2007) (renumbered as &sect; 379.3311, Fla. Stat. (2008)) and &sect; 372.76, Fla. Stat. (renumbered as &sect; 379.334, Fla. Stat. (2008)). Because the trial court found no reasonable suspicion existed for the stop of defendant's truck, the court erred in denying the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of the motion to suppress was reversed, and the case was remanded for the trial court to grant the motion, which entitled defendant to discharge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge instructed the jury that aggravated battery based on the great bodily harm theory was a lesser-included offense of aggravated battery with a firearm. The prisoner argued that regardless of whether a firearm was used or not, the judge did not have discretion to impose a lesser punishment. The issue the prisoner raised was preserved and argued on direct appeal and was rejected on the merits. He then raised the same claim in a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion to correct illegal sentence which was denied on the merits and affirmed. He raised the same and similar variants of the same claim again in a motion for postconviction relief. That motion was also denied and affirmed on the merits. The instant motions again raised variants of the same issue that had been repeatedly denied and rejected on appeal. The appellate court held the alleged error was not the type of error that could be raised at any time and which called for disturbing the finality of the conviction. The evidence of an aggravated battery was strong if not overwhelming. The jury had an opportunity to exercise its &quot;pardon power&quot; by convicting of simple battery but refused to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defense counsel moved to dismiss a charge against defendant based on prosecutorial misconduct--listening to telephone conversations between counsel and defendant at the county jail. The Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), denied the motion, but ordered disqualification of the State Attorney's Office. The State petitioned for a writ of certiorari or prohibition. Defendant moved to dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the appellate court did not have jurisdiction based on Weir. In Weir, the Florida Supreme Court held that the State's ability to seek certiorari review of an interlocutory order in a criminal case was limited to pretrial orders. Once jeopardy attached, the State could not get immediate review of a nonfinal order. Although review might be available in the event of a mistrial, in general, the state supreme court found no exception to this rule. The appellate court agreed with defendant's argument and concluded that even if extraordinary writ jurisdiction might be invoked to review an order entered after a criminal trial commenced, it would deny the petition in this case because the trial court did not depart from the essential requirements of law. The record supported the trial court's findings that the case law cited was distinguishable and that there was no waiver of the attorney-client privilege based on the circumstances. In addition, the trial court expressly found that the calls contained trial strategy and that the conversations included privileged information that had been discussed throughout the State Attorney's Office.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Hillsborough County Circuit Court (Florida) entered a judgment that granted a motion to suppress in favor of the first defendant and second defendant after they were charged with trafficking in cannabis, and the second defendant was also charged with possession of cannabis. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A detective applied for a warrant to search the first defendant's apartment. In support, the detective filed her affidavit stating she had &quot;reason to believe&quot; that marijuana &quot;is now being kept&quot; at his apartment. She described contacts involving a confidential informant (CI) and the first defendant. The CI eventually negotiated a cannabis purchase and was informed that the first defendant's supplier, later identified as the second defendant, would be arriving at the first defendant's apartment in 10 minutes with the cannabis. A judge then issued a search warrant and the warrant was executed. After the first and second defendants were charged with trafficking in and possession of cannabis, the trial court suppressed the evidence that was found. The appellate court found that the trial court should have applied the Grubbs totality-of-the-circumstances approach to determining probable cause and that the search warrant affidavit showed probable cause existed to believe the cannabis would be at the first defendant's apartment when the warrant was executed, meaning the right to be free from unreasonable searches under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Art. I, &sect; 12, Fla. Const. was not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment granting suppression and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver sued appellees, a lessee, an attorney, an operator, and a lessor, claiming that the lessor was vicariously liable for the operator's negligent operation of the car under Florida's dangerous instrumentality doctrine because it failed to comply with the insurance requirements of &sect; 324.021(9)(b)(1), Fla. Stat. (2002). The Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida) granted summary judgment in favor of the lessor. The driver appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver allegedly sustained serious injuries when a car the operator was driving collided with the driver's car. The operator's car was owned by the lessor, and leased to the lessee, a law firm. The insurance policy which the lessee had on the vehicle lapsed for nonpayment the day before the accident. The issue on appeal was whether the Graves Amendment, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106, limited the lessor's liability. The appellate court concluded that the plain language of &sect; 324.021(9)(b)(2), Fla. Stat. (2002), merely gave the leading company the option to have insurance in place to avoid liability in Florida under the dangerous instrumentality doctrine. Because &sect; 324.021(9)(b)(2) did not compel the lessor to have certain insurance standards, &sect; 324.021(9)(b)(2) did not impose liability for a failure to meet those optional standards. Thus, the appellate court upheld the trial court's ruling. However, the court certified to the supreme court a question of great public important: Does the Graves Amendment, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106, preempt &sect; 324.021(9)(b)(1), Fla. Stat. (2002)?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. A question of great public importance was certified to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four consolidated cases, the Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida) appointed petitioner regional counsel to represent four respondents in post-conviction proceedings, and denied the regional counsel's motions to withdraw in each case. The regional counsel sought a writ of certiorari or alternatively, a writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The regional counsel argued that the statutory duties of his office did not encompass post-conviction proceedings. The appellate court agreed. The authority of Office of Criminal Conflict and Civil Regional Counsel (Regional Counsel) to represent criminal defendants in post-conviction proceedings was not set forth as an assigned duty in &sect; 27.511(5), Fla. Stat. (2008). When the general provision of &sect; 27.40, Fla. Stat. was read in pari materia with the more specific statute,&nbsp;&sect; 27.511(5), Fla. Stat., it was clear that post-conviction collateral proceedings were not within the realm of the regional counsel's duties of representation. There was no absolute constitutional right to post-conviction counsel. If a trial court determined that appointment of post-conviction counsel was necessary in a particular Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 proceeding, there was no specific provision for the appointment of the regional counsel under &sect; 27.511, Fla. Stat. The appointments constituted a departure from the essential requirements of law for which certiorari relief was available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Florida Secretary of State, sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County, Florida, which certified a class of corporate plaintiffs that asserted that late annual report and reinstatement fees paid to the Secretary by them violated the Excessive Punishments section, Art. I, &sect; 17, Fla. Const. Appellees were the two corporations named as class representatives.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Discovery revealed that over 249,000 Florida corporations had paid a $400 late annual report fee between 1997 and 2007 and that over 97,000 had paid a $600 reinstatement fee. The first three elements of Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(a) were unquestionably present--the class was numerous, the claims of the putative class members involved common issues of law and fact, and the claims of the proposed class representatives were typical of those of the class as a whole. The adequacy of appellees as class representatives was the issue. Corporation one had indicated the ability to pay for a mailing to putative class members, but was unfamiliar with what other costs might be involved. Corporation two had no assets or money. The case was one of first impression. The Secretary would defend the lawsuit vigorously and thoroughly. Regardless of whether appellees sought a full disgorgement of the more than $150 million in fees collected or simply amounts considered as &quot;excessive,&quot; the proceedings were likely to be protracted. As the fees were entitled to presumptive validity under Art. I, &sect; 18, Fla. Const., the likelihood of shifting any of the costs of the case to the Secretary was very low.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the certification order on the &quot;adequacy&quot; requirement imposed by Rule 1.220(a)(4). The order was otherwise affirmed. On remand, the trial court was to require the filing of a second amended complaint that, inter alia, clarified the nature of the monetary relief sought. The trial court was then to require appellees to demonstrate their financial capacity to participate in the costs likely to be incurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Nassau County Property Appraiser (appraiser) appealed a judgment entered by the Circuit Court for Nassau County (Florida) holding that &sect; 196.061, Fla. Stat. was unconstitutional as applied to appellee condominium owners, and ordering the appraiser to grant the owners a homestead tax exemption for the years 2003, 2004, and 2005.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that &sect; 196.061 (2005) was not unconstitutional as applied to the owners as under former art. VII, &sect; 6, Fla. Const., the Florida legislature could establish the procedures for claiming a homestead tax exemption. Section 196.061 properly established how rental property was to be treated under the homestead exemption law. Under &sect; 196.061, the owners rented their entire dwelling, notwithstanding the fact that they reserved two locked closets for personal storage. The claim that reserving the locked closets meant that the entire dwelling was not rented was rejected as it was grounded in a decontextualized literalism that overemphasized the word &quot;entire&quot; and ignored its context. Adherence to such a literal interpretation would produce an unreasonable result. The trial court was instructed that it had to address the provision stating that an abandonment of a homestead after January 1 of any year was not to affect the homestead exemption for tax purposes for that particular year so long as the provision was not used for two consecutive years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. The case was remanded with instructions for the trial court to enter an order consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The County Court for Brevard County (Florida), where an entire cash bond posted by a person other than a licensed bail bondsman was withheld, ruled that &sect; 903.286, Fla. Stat. (2007) was constitutional. It also ruled, however, that the statute only allowed sums owed in a particular case for which the bond was posted to be withheld. The county court certified questions of constitutionality of the statute and statutory application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The criminal defendant was charged with DUI. Another individual, who was not a bail bondsman, posted a cash bond on his behalf. That other individual signed a bond form stating that the clerk of the court was required to withhold sufficient funds to pay &quot;any&quot; unpaid amounts due. The criminal defendant pled guilty; the trial court then assessed fines, court costs, and fees. However, the clerk of the court withheld the balance of the cash bond to cover outstanding amounts owed on the criminal defendant's three other criminal cases. That left nothing to remit. The trial court certified the questions to the appellate court about whether the relevant statute allowing bond amounts to be withheld, &sect; 903.286, Fla. Stat. (2007), was constitutional and whether cash bond amounts could be applied to multiple cases. The appellate court found that the statute did not violate constitutional guarantees of procedural due process, equal protection, proper takings, single subject, or excessive bail. It also determined that the statute expressly stated that cash on the bond could be withheld on &quot;any&quot; amounts due and did not limit the amount to the immediately relevant case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's finding that the statute was constitutional. It reversed the trial court's finding that the cash bond could only be used to pay for outstanding amounts due in the criminal matter at issue rather than all of the outstanding amounts due regarding a particular defendant's cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner had sought permits needed to develop his property. The district replied that it would approve the permits only if the owner agreed to satisfy certain conditions, one of which was the performance of &quot;off-site&quot; mitigation involving property a considerable distance from the owner's property. The owner claimed that the conditions were unreasonable and rejected the offer. The district then denied the permits. The district argued that the lower court never had subject matter jurisdiction because &sect; 373.617(2), Fla. Stat. expressly limited the scope of circuit court review to cases in which a constitutional taking was proven. The district argued that the owner's claim was really a challenge to the merits of the permit denial, which, it argued, may only have been pursued in an administrative proceeding, and that no exaction occurred because nothing was exacted from the owner. The appellate court disagreed. An exaction claim was cognizable when, as here, the land owner refused to agree to an improper request from the government resulting in a permit denial. Any requirement that a developer provide or do something as a condition to receiving approval was an exaction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an insurance coverage dispute, the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida) entered summary judgment in favor of appellee insurers. It held that under &sect; 627.727(2), Fla. Stat. (2003), appellant insured had no uninsured (UM) or underinsured motorist coverage under his personal liability umbrella policy because he had rejected such coverage at the time he applied for the policy. The insured appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured rejected UM coverage in 1992. The insured never sought to rescind his 1992 rejection and never communicated with the insurers on the subject. The court stated that &sect; 627.727(2) required only that an issuer of a non-primary policy notify an applicant of the availability of UM coverage, which the insurers had done. It rejected the insured's argument that he was entitled to UM coverage because changes had been made to the policy from time to time, including the addition of new vehicles that had not been previously registered in Florida. Unlike the case relied upon by the insured, the case here involved the same umbrella policy initially issued in Florida in 1992 to the same named insured, bearing the same policy number and providing coverage in the same amount. Next, the unambiguous language in &sect; 627.727(2) trumped any and all canons of interpretation, and the 1984 amendments to the statute treated excess policies differently from primary policies. Finally, the failure of the rejection form to track the language of &sect; 627.727(1), which did not apply to excess policies such as the umbrella policy at issue here, did not render the 1992 rejection form ambiguous or deficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Indian River County, (Florida) that convicted him of two counts of lewd and lascivious acts involving a minor male; defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court erred in allowing the victim to be cross-examined about a prior false accusation of sexual misconduct, and in partially closing the courtroom during the minor's testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's first trial, his convictions were reversed and remanded for a new trial because the trial court improperly closed the courtroom during the testimony of the minor without having a hearing to determine if it was necessary. During the cross-examination of the minor in defendant's retrial, defendant's counsel asked if he had ever made an accusation about someone else having sex with him and later withdrawn it. The appellate court found, inter alia, that a proffer was necessary since the record was silent as to whether the minor had ever made such an accusation or withdrawn it. It was not clear if such evidence would have been admissible. Accordingly, the issue was not preserved. Defendant's right to a public trial was not violated since section 918.16, Florida Statutes (2001) allowed partial closure during the limited time in which the minor testified about the sex offense. Because defendant attempted to solicit the murder of the prosecutor and the victim while he was awaiting retrial, his vindictive argument was without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions and closure were affirmed, and the matter was remanded for resentencing; conflict was certified on a sentencing issue involving credit for time served where there were multiple sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a company and its employee, sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida), which reinstated a lawsuit filed by appellee, a Panamanian corporation, that had previously been dismissed for forum non conveniens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee allegedly met the corporation's president at a trade show in Florida and recommended the use of one of the company's products for the corporation's orchids. The product allegedly destroyed thousands of the corporation's orchids in Panama. The corporation's president maintained a home office in Miami, and the corporation initially filed its lawsuit for damages there. After the action was dismissed for forum non conveniens, Panama had enacted a law to block transfers based on forum non conveniens. A Panamanian court declined jurisdiction, and the case was reinstated in Florida, but subsequently, the Panamanian law was found unconstitutional. An appeal in Panama was pending. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Based on the decision in Kinney Systems, Inc. v. Continental Insurance Co., 674 So.2d 86 (Fla. 1996), the case should have remained in Panama as the injury occurred there and the damages were suffered by a Panamanian corporation. The court noted that the corporation's appeal in Panama was not in good faith but, on its face, an intentional effort to obtain an affirmance of the dismissal of the case in Panama as further support for reinstatement in Florida.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of reinstatement and remanded the case to the trial court for dismissal. That dismissal was not to include a retention of jurisdiction in the event the Panamanian court dismissed the action on grounds of preemption or a blocking statute. The court was to retain jurisdiction under Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.061(h) to enforce the stipulations in Rule 1.061 and in the instant opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court for Osceola County (Florida) convicted defendant of driving under the influence (DUI) with three prior convictions for that offense, and driving while license suspended with two prior convictions for that offense. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court committed error by refusing to strike a juror for cause. The juror had opined rather steadfastly that he would give more credibility to a police officer than to defendant or to other witnesses. The appellate court found that, while the juror was rehabilitated to some extent by the prosecution, upon examination by the defense, he restated his partiality for police officers. The trial court erred in seating that person as a juror, and accordingly, a reversal was required. The trial court's admission into evidence of the court file in of one of defendant's prior DUI convictions and the publishing of information in that file to the jury was an affront to fairness and was reversible. The rational connection test was satisfied by section 316.193(12), Florida Statues (2007), and, as applied to defendant, was constitutional. As the driving record, uncontested, was sufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the person convicted of the prior offenses enumerated in the record, the trial court did not err in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial. A question was certified to the Supreme Court of Florida.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order by the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), that modified his probation to include electronic monitoring more than 60 days after the probationary sentence was imposed; defendant challenged the modification on double jeopardy and jurisdictional grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was placed on probation for unlawful sexual activity involving a minor victim, he pleaded no contest to his failure to register as required by &sect; 775.21(8)(a), Fla. Stat., and was placed on five years of sexual offender probation. Approximately 11 months later, the trial court granted the Department of Corrections' motion to add electronic monitoring as a condition of defendant's probation. The appellate court found, inter alia, that pursuant to &sect; 948.30, Fla. Stat., the trial court was required to impose electronic monitoring as a mandatory condition of probation because of defendant's prior convictions for violations of ch. 794 and &sect; 800.04, 948.30(3) Fla. Stat. However, because the Department was not seeking to modify the probation order, but to add electronic monitoring, pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(c), the trial court had only 60 days after sentencing to modify the order to include the condition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed, and the matter was remanded with directions to strike electronic monitoring as a condition of defendant's probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Collier County (Florida) denied appellant foreign state resident's motion to dismiss the complaint filed by appellee cousin for lack of personal jurisdiction after the cousin sued the foreign state resident for taping a phone conversation without the cousin's permission in violation of the Florida Security of Communications Act, &sect; 934.03, Fla. Stat. (2002). The foreign state resident appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foreign state resident and the cousin were first cousins. The foreign state resident lived in Nebraska. The cousin lived in Colorado. Both of them were board members of a Nebraska charitable foundation. They were apparently on opposite sides of a dispute. The cousin went to Florida to visit his father. The cousin in Florida called the foreign state resident in Nebraska. During the call, the foreign state resident placed his wireless phone handset near a tape recorder and recorded the conversation without the cousin's consent. Later, the foreign state resident played part of the recording to his wife. The cousin eventually sued for violation of the Florida Security of Communications Act, &sect; 934.03, Fla. Stat. (2002) for the recording of the phone conversation without the cousin's permission. The trial court denied the foreign state resident's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, based on Koch. The appellate court rejected the reasoning in Koch and held that the long-arm statute,&nbsp;&sect; 48.193(1)(b), Fla. Stat. (2002), did not provide a basis for personal jurisdiction over the foreign state resident because he did not engage in any actions inside Florida.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee personal representative brought a negligence action against appellants, a sub-subcontractor and his driver (&quot;first driver&quot;). The Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Indian River County (Florida) entered partial summary judgment denying appellants workers' compensation immunity under &sect; 440.10(1)(e), Fla. Stat. (2004) and granted appellee's cross-motion for summary judgment. Appellants challenged the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee's decedent was killed when his dump truck and the first driver's truck collided. Both the first driver and the decedent were working for sub-subcontractors on a road construction project, and both worked for the same general contractor. The court stated that under &sect; 440.10, the general contractor was the statutory employer of appellants. Because the subcontractor and the sub-subcontractor both failed to obtain workers' compensation, the general contractor was responsible for providing such coverage to appellants, and its policy provided for just that. Thus, because appellants were covered by the general contractor's policy and because appellee did not assert that the major contributing cause of the accident was the first driver's gross negligence, appellants were entitled to horizontal immunity. Next, &sect; 440.10(1)(e) did not violate Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 by depriving appellee of the common law right to sue. Had appellee been able to show that the first driver was grossly negligent, she could have sued appellants in tort; thus, the right to sue had not been completely abolished. Moreover, the decedent's survivors had been beneficiaries of workers' compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the partial summary judgment for appellee. It directed the trial court to enter summary judgment for appellants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State Board of Education (Florida) entered a decision pursuant to &sect; 1002.335, Fla. Stat. (2006) that allowed three school boards to retain their exclusive power to authorize charter schools in their respective districts, but denied the resolutions of 28 other schools boards to retain that power. Appellant school boards appealed and challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 1002.335, Fla. Stat. (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida legislature enacted &sect; 1002.335, Fla. Stat. (2006), which established the &quot;Florida Schools of Excellence Commission&quot; to authorize charter schools throughout Florida. Under &sect; 1002.335, Fla. Stat. (2006), the district school boards could exercise that exclusive authority only if the State Board of Education granted them such power. Multiple school boards sought to retain that exclusive authority. After conducting hearings, the State Board of Education allowed only three school boards to retain their exclusive authority; the requests of the remaining school boards were denied. Several school boards then challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 1002.335, Fla. Stat. (2006). The appellate court found that the statute totally and fatally conflicted with Art. IX, &sect; 4, Fla. Const., which gave the school boards the power to operate public education, because the statute allowed the commission to operate charter schools as a public education alternative. The appellate court also found that it did not matter that only a few schools would be operated as charter schools as an allegedly small constitutional violation was not less important than an larger constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the summary denial of his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion by the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida). The trial court in this case found that defendant had violated the terms of his plea agreement. Defendant listed more than twelve claims that attacked the voluntariness of his plea and raised other matters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to drug-related crimes. As part of the plea, he entered into a substantial assistance agreement with the State and agreed to work with a detective in making drug-related arrests. A tape recording of defendant agreeing to the terms of the substantial assistance agreement was created. A factual dispute existed as to whether defendant provided assistance or not, but he admitted that he fled and changed his name. The appellate court held that most of the claims were conclusorily alleged and did not merit relief. The State did not attach any records regarding what transpired when the plea was entered, such as a transcript of a plea hearing or a written plea form. Thus, the appellate court could not determine whether the terms discussed in the taped substantial assistance agreement were incorporated into the plea that defendant entered before the court. In addition, the tape offered to refute defendant's claims was not authenticated. While the person on the tape appeared to have understood what was occurring and declined the assistance of an interpreter, the tape alone did not refute defendant's claims regarding what occurred when he entered his plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed. On remand, if records regarding the plea agreement could not be obtained, then an evidentiary hearing might be required to establish what transpired at the plea hearing and to permit defendant an opportunity to prove any of his facially sufficient claims. In addition, defendant was to have a reasonable opportunity to amend any insufficiently-pleaded claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the successor trustee of two trusts, sought review of a final judgment of the Circuit Court for Walton County, Florida, entered in favor of appellee county on claims that included inverse condemnation. That claim involved the county's diversion of water across a portion of property originally purchased by the trustee's deceased parents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed as to all issues except the inverse condemnation claim. Before the parents purchased the property in 1988, a ditch draining a lake's outflow had been stabilized and did not discharge water across the property. That drainage was not changed until the county acted in 1995 to alleviate flooding across a neighbor's property caused by a hurricane. Efforts to restabilize the water flow failed. The continued flow, caused by the county, not the hurricane, constituted a taking. The fact that water flowed across the property prior to 1988 was not legally relevant. The county could not choose to act and protect the property of one owner by diverting floodwater onto the trust property without compensation to the trustee. By allowing the water to flow long after the emergency had passed, the county had conferred a public benefit on other property owners rather than preventing a public harm. Further, while &sect; 252.43(6), Fla. Stat. allowed the county to act in an emergency, that did not preclude the trustee, as an innocent property owner from initiating her takings claim. The statute could not restrict the rights granted to the trustee under Art. X, &sect; 6, Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the final judgment and remanded the matter with directions that judgment be entered for the trustee on her inverse condemnation claim and that a determination of the value of the taking be made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order by the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) which granted the motion of defendant to suppress certain evidence seized during an investigatory stop because his clothing did not match an informant's written description.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police received information from a reliable confidential informant that he had just purchased crack cocaine in a parking lot which was in a high crime area. The informant gave a verbal description of two men. The officers subsequently saw defendant and two other persons who allegedly matched the verbal description. When the individuals saw the officers, they began to walk away hurriedly. The individual with defendant threw an item that turned out to be crack cocaine under a parked truck. The officers caught up with defendant they discovered him holding several pieces of crack cocaine. The officers did not see the informant's written description until after the arrest. Neither defendant, nor his companion were the person who actually sold the contraband to the informant. The appellate court held that, under the circumstances, the written description was not relevant to the legal determination before it. For constitutional purposes the court could only evaluate the information in the possession of the officers at the time of the stop. The investigatory stop was valid as the officers had a reasonable suspicion to believe that defendant was involved in criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suppression order was reversed and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with wearing a uniform and insignia of rank in violation of &sect; 250.43, Fla. Stat. (2007). The County Court for Orange County (Florida) held that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and violated the Due Process Clause. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Transportation Security Administration agent at an airport saw defendant, wearing a U.S. Army uniform, standing in a lane used by military and security personnel. He became suspicious when he noticed that defendant's hair was longer than allowed in the military. Defendant admitted that he was not in the Army. The court rejected the State's argument that defendant's conduct was not protected by the First Amendment. The court could conceive of situations where a person might wear part of a military uniform to communicate a message, such as to express support for the troops or to protest military action. Thus, the court had to determine whether the statute was supported by a compelling governmental interest and was narrowly drawn to protect that interest. While the state had a compelling interest in ensuring that the public was not deceived by people impersonating members of the military, the statute had no element of specific intent to deceive. Without such an element, it criminalized both innocent, protected conduct and unprotected conduct, and was on that basis both overbroad and a violation of due process. There was no way to read the statute more narrowly without rewriting it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order by the Circuit Court for Sarasota County (Florida) which granted defendant's motion to suppress physical evidence, primarily powder cocaine, which was found in a secret compartment inside a car he was driving as a result of a traffic stop. The trial court concluded that, while defendant initially consented to a search, he withdrew his consent by nonverbal communication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped defendant as his windows were heavily tinted and the tag light was inoperable. Defendant consented to a search of the car, including any containers and compartments. An officer found an &quot;after-market compartment&quot; in the right rear passenger area. It took two officers approximately an hour to open the secret compartment. Inside they found more than 270 grams of powder cocaine. Defendant argued, inter alia, that he had withdrawn consent to search after the deputies found the compartment, but before they opened it. He also argued that the destructive nature of the search, forcing open the secret compartment, was beyond the scope of his consent. The trial court also based its decision on the officer's failure to use an available videorecorder to record the consent. Accepting the trial court's findings of fact, the appellate court concluded that the State established that defendant took no action that an objectively reasonable police officer would interpret as a withdrawal of his consent to search, including the consent to search the secret compartment. Also, an officer was not required to record a roadside consent to fulfill the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case involving appellant father's child support obligation pursuant to a November 2007 dissolution order, the father appealed the order of the Circuit Court for Sarasota County (Florida), which found him guilty of indirect criminal contempt pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.840 and sentenced him to 90 days in the county jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because criminal contempt was a crime in the ordinary sense, imposition of criminal contempt sanctions required that a contemnor be afforded the same constitutional due process protections afforded to criminal defendants. These rights included the right not to incriminate oneself. The appellate court concluded that the trial court erred in the indirect criminal contempt proceeding when it allowed itself to be persuaded by the argument of the former wife's attorney that the right not to be compelled to incriminate oneself did not apply in such a proceeding. Thus, the trial court erred in compelling the father to testify against himself and the error was not harmless because when the father's testimony was removed from consideration, the remaining evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he willfully violated a prior court order. Essentially, the only competent evidence before the court was the father's child support payment record and the former wife's testimony that the father was not assisting her financially.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's order and remanded the case for a new hearing. The trial court was directed to enter an order releasing the father to the bail status to which he was admitted as of the show-cause hearing or, if he was not admitted to bail, an order releasing him from confinement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent claimed that defendant tried to take patients away from her and that when respondent tried to get her patients back, defendant defamed her to get her thrown off the hospital's medical staff. A former patient of respondent's filed an affidavit requesting that any hospital records pertaining to any adverse medical incident involving the patient be turned over to her and respondent's attorney; she claimed that after a successful surgery performed by respondent, defendant removed her as a patient of respondent's and listed her as one of defendant's patients. The hospital refused to produce peer review materials. The court denied the petition. Art. X, &sect; 25 had removed any barrier to a patient's discovery of adverse medical incident information, including peer review protections previously provided by &sect; 381.028, Fla. Stat. (2005), which had been declared unconstitutional. Art. X, &sect; 25 only required that a patient request the materials and did not require that the information be sought for any type of proper purpose and be relevant to a medical malpractice action. Once the information was obtained, the patient was not limited as to whom the patient could reveal the information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the State of Florida, Department of Transportation, brought an eminent domain proceeding against appellant church in the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida). The church brought an inverse condemnation counterclaim for compensation against the Department and appellee county. The trial court granted summary judgment to the Department and the county on the church's counterclaim. The church appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church dedicated a portion of its parcel of vacant land to the public for roadway use, as a condition of receiving plat approval from the county to build a church and school. The dedication condition was pursuant to county ordinances. The plat was filed. The Department's eminent domain proceeding was brought to condemn a separate parcel for a road widening project. The church's inverse condemnation counterclaim sought compensation for the Department's use of a portion of the previously dedicated parcel for the road project. The church claimed it still owned the previously dedicated/platted land because the dedication was an unconstitutional condition of plat approval and, therefore, void. The trial court found that the church's claim was barred by the statute of limitations under &sect; 95.11(3)(p), Fla. Stat. On appeal, the court found that the claim by the church was time-barred by the statute as the rights of third parties were not affected. Furthermore, the subject conveyance was not void ab initio, but merely voidable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On a motion for rehearing, appellant psychiatric patient appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Orange County, Florida, subjecting her to six months of additional involuntary mental health treatment pursuant to &sect; 394.467(6), Fla. Stat. (2007). Appellee was the State of Florida.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police found the patient in an agitated state at an airport and took her to a hospital for an involuntary mental health evaluation under the Baker Act, &sect; 394.463, Fla. Stat. (2007). At the hospital's request, the circuit court committed her for three weeks of inpatient treatment at the hospital under Florida's Mental Health Act, &sect; 394.467, Fla. Stat. (2007). When she did not respond to treatment, the circuit court committed her for six additional months of involuntary inpatient psychiatric treatment at a state-run mental health facility under &sect; 394.467(6), Fla. Stat. (2007). The patient argued that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to order the additional treatment. On appeal, the court held that because the initial period was for short-term treatment at a receiving facility, the circuit court retained concurrent jurisdiction to order further treatment. The court rejected the patient's argument that, under &sect; 394.467(7), Fla. Stat. (2007), any hearing for continued treatment was required to be administrative. The legislature intended to give the circuit court jurisdiction for short-term treatment up to six months, while long-term treatment required administrative hearings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the patient's motion for rehearing, withdrew its prior opinion and substituted a new opinion using the patient's initials to maintain her confidentiality, and affirmed the decision of the circuit court. The court ordered that access to the patient's file be restricted and that the file be treated as confidential.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee employee sued appellant school board, challenging the school board's action in barring the employee from school property pursuant to &sect;&sect; 1012.465, 1012.467, Fla. Stat., because of his nolo contendere plea to child abuse. The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) enjoined the school board from barring the employee, and then denied the school board's motion to dissolve the injunction. The school board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the employee was barred from school property, his employment with a third party was terminated. The employee argued that &sect;&sect; 1012.465, 1012.467, Fla. Stat., were unconstitutional as applied to him, claiming that they retroactively converted his nolo contendere plea into a conviction thereby depriving him of &quot;his vested rights&quot; to come onto the school board's property. In identifying the employee's vested right, the trial court referred to the employee's &quot;loss of a job&quot; and the employee's right to come on the school board's property. However, the appellate court found that the school board neither terminated the employee's employment nor demanded that his employment be terminated. And, neither the order under review, nor the employee, cited a basis for claiming a vested right to go onto school grounds. Rather, it had always been left to the school board's discretion whether to allow a workman such as the employee to enter onto school property. Because the employee failed to demonstrate that the school board's actions divested him of a right of present enjoyment, or a present fixed right of future enjoyment, he did meet the requirements necessary for issuance of an injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the school board's motion to dissolve the temporary injunction was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of battery evidencing prejudice. The trial court sentenced defendant as a habitual violent offender to seven years imprisonment with a mandatory minimum of five years under &sect;&sect; 784.03, 775.085, and 775.084(4), Fla. Stat. (2002). The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) issued its denial of defendant's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b) motion to correct a sentencing error. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was white, attacked the victim, who was African American, at a convenience store. While the appellate court concluded that the trial court erred in instructing the jury as to both forms of battery listed in &sect; 784.03, Fla. Stat., where the information only charged that defendant committed battery by actually and intentionally touching or striking the victim, the appellate court also found the error did not amount to fundamental error, requiring a new trial, because defendant admitted to striking the victim and thus, the erroneous in instruction did not concern a disputed jury issue. The admission of an officer's testimony that defendant called him a racial slur was not erroneous, because the comment was made shortly after the charged incident and was relevant to the issue of defendant's motivation in striking the victim. The appellate court further concluded that &sect; 775.085, Fla. Stat., was not unconstitutional on its face or as applied to defendant. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the Miranda form used was legally sufficient, as held by the court in a prior action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former employee was convicted for bribery and receipt of unlawful compensation or reward for official behavior.

Stat. was unconstitutional because, as applied, it violated his constitutional protections against excessive fines, double jeopardy, and ex-post facto laws. The employee suggested that the forfeiture should have applied only to that part of the pension that accrued during his tenure as a county commissioner and not to part that accrued while he served as a teacher and legislator. The appellate court held that the forfeiture was not a fine because the employee was not ordered to pay anything to the government. The Double Jeopardy Clause was not violated by the forfeiture. There was no second prosecution. The employee was not receiving multiple punishments for the same offense. Because &sect; 112.3173(3), Fla. Stat. (2003) was enacted before the employee committed the crimes for which he was convicted, &sect; 112.3173 did not reach back in time and did not violate the proscription against ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State brought a petition for involuntary inpatient placement to request involuntary psychiatric care for appellant patient.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to order the continued treatment. The appellate court found, based on a full reading &sect; 394.467, Fla. Stat., that the procedure followed by the trial court was proper. Because the initial three week treatment period was short-term treatment at a receiving facility, the trial court retained jurisdiction to order further treatment. The initial treatment ordered for the patient was at a hospital which fit the statutory definition of a &quot;receiving facility.&quot; Thus, when the administrator of this receiving facility filed a petition for continued involuntary placement, the receiving facility administrator was not required to file with the Division of Administrative Hearings under Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 65E-5.300, which, consistent with &sect; 394.467(7)(b), Fla. Stat., only required &quot;treatment facility&quot; administrators to have done so. More importantly, because the treatment ordered was short-term, the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction to order further treatment. However, once long-term treatment was ordered, a petition for continued treatment was required to have been addressed in an administrative hearing under &sect; 394.467.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a corporation making and selling products nationally and worldwide, sued and claimed that Florida's treatment of domestic versus foreign dividends for tax purposes discriminated because losses created by domestic dividend deductions could always be carried over while the foreign tax credit, calculated through the payment of foreign dividends, could not. The taxpayer based its discrimination claim on the foreign Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, 1, and asserted that the limit under &sect; 220.13(1), Fla. Stat. (2004) on net loss carryovers pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 172 discriminated against foreign corporate dividends. The department found against it. The appellate court then determined that Florida's taxing scheme did not facially discriminate against foreign corporate dividends because Florida went &quot;above and beyond&quot; the federal governments treatment of foreign dividends by offering corporations the ability to carry over net operating losses resulting from the deduction of foreign taxes paid and the possible deduction of other significant foreign dividends based on those same excluded foreign source dividends.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court denied the taxpayer's motion for rehearing and affirmed the department's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 827.071 required a showing that the child victim made contact with one of the designated sexual areas of another person and that there was no evidence to that effect. The appellate court disagreed. Section 827.071(3), Fla. Stat., as written, defined sexual conduct broadly enough to cover contact by one party with the designated sexual areas of another party regardless of whether the child victim made the contact or received the contact. The trial court did not err in issuing a jury instruction regarding the fact that defendant's ignorance of the victim's age, the victim's misrepresentation of her age, or defendant's bona fide belief of the victim's age, was not a defense. The trial court did not err in admitting photos of defendant's house because the photos were relevant to corroborate the testimony presented by the State's witnesses concerning the fact that the crime took place inside defendant's home and to refute a claim that the photos of the child victim were altered by use of computer software. Defendant was properly adjudicated a sexual predator. There was no due process violation in applying &sect; 775.21, Fla. Stat. (2007) in this situation.</SPAN></P>

Stat. (2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute criminalized hazing as a rite of initiation into student organizations and made it a felony to participate in hazing activities that resulted in &quot;serious bodily injury.&quot; Defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 1006.63(2), arguing that the statute was facially void for vagueness because it did not specify what constituted &quot;serious bodily injury.&quot; The court, however, rejected defendant's facial challenge because the statute was not vague in light of the facts of the case, which showed that defendant participated in a two-day caning ritual during which the victim sustained 150 cane strikes to his buttocks. The victim's physician testified that he sustained a hematoma that required surgical removal. The court also rejected defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. The court, however, found that defendant was entitled to a new trial because of an erroneous jury instruction that impermissibly narrowed the range of findings jurors could have made in order to acquit. The instruction on the definition of &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; effectively allowed the jury to convict if they found that the victim's injuries were anything more than &quot;slight.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant personal representative of decedent's estate sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), in her favor and against appellee nursing home as to a breach of contract action in regard to resuscitative measures being taken contrary to the decedent's expressed will and from the trial court's order denying her motion for prejudgment interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was admitted to the nursing home at the age of 89. At the time, she had an admitting diagnosis of senile dementia and a seizure disorder. The nursing home signed a living will/advance directive that stated there were to be no life-prolonging treatments or resuscitative measures taken if she had a terminal condition or was in the process of dying. The nursing home staff found the decedent unresponsive, but breathing, in her bed. They called 911. EMS intubated the decedent and took her to the hospital. During transport, she was placed in physical restraints. She was subsequently extubated and died several days later of cardiopulmonary arrest. The appellate court held that the immediate wrong suffered was akin to wrongful prolongation of life. The trial court was correct that prejudgment interest depended on the nature of the damages claimed. Thus, the fact that the estate recovered under a breach of contract theory should not automatically entitle it to prejudgment interest if the nature of damages was inappropriate for such interest. Although the estate's action was technically for breach of contract, the damages sought involved unliquidated personal injury damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant subscribers brought a class action complaint against appellee director, alleging that the Communications Services Tax statute,&nbsp;&sect; 202.12, Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subscribers alleged that &sect; 202.12, Fla. Stat. was facially unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause to the extent that it imposed a sales tax on satellite television service, an out-of-state service, in an amount greater than that imposed on cable television service, an in-state service. The director asserted that the subscribers' challenge was an as-applied challenge and that, as they failed to timely file suit within 180 days of receiving notice that their refund request had been denied, the action was time-barred pursuant to &sect; 202.23, Fla. Stat. The subscribers acknowledged that dismissal was appropriate if their constitutional challenge were treated as an as-applied challenge because the suit would have been time-barred. Similarly, the director acknowledged that a refund request would have been unnecessary if the subscribers' constitutional challenge were treated as a facial challenge. The appellate court found that the subscribers alleged that the higher sales tax, on its face, was unconstitutional in every instance of satellite television service in Florida. Thus, contrary to the trial court's ruling, the subscribers' challenge was facial in nature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim testified that, during the attempted robbery, she saw something in defendant's hand, but could not make out what it was. Defendant pushed her against a counter, and she felt something hard on her left shoulder blade. The victim did not otherwise describe what was in defendant's hand. A woman, who worked with the victim, testified that when a man standing over the victim saw her, he ran out of the store. The woman did not observe a firearm or any other weapon. Other witnesses testified as to defendant's use of a firearm in a second crime committed soon after the attempted robbery. Defendant testified that he carried a stick taped to a glove during his encounter with the victim. He said that he used the item to just point, and denied having a firearm. On appeal, the court found that, although the evidence was insufficient to establish that defendant used a weapon, as defined by &sect; 790.001(13), Fla. Stat. (2005), during his attempted robbery of the victim, the jury found and the record supported that defendant attempted to rob the victim. Thus, defendant was to be convicted and resentenced for the lesser offense of attempted robbery pursuant to &sect; 924.34, Fla. Stat. (2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction for attempted robbery with a deadly weapon was reversed and remanded for entry of an amended judgment reflecting a conviction for attempted robbery and for resentencing. The remaining convictions and sentences were affirmed without discussion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a county and a county comptroller, sought review of a final order by the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) which dismissed with prejudice their amended complaint for declaratory relief that sought a judgment that the Tourist Development Tax (TDT) imposed on appellee internet travel companies was due on the difference between the wholesale price and the retail price they received for the rooms when they resold them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal revolved around whether a taxing agency could obtain a declaratory judgment when in doubt as to the meaning or application of a tax statute or ordinance without the need to first exhaust the full panoply of administrative remedies associated with tax collection lawsuits. The internet travel companies negotiated with hotels for a discounted or wholesale price, from which they purchased room nights and then re-sold them at a marked up rate. The county and comptroller alleged that under the TDT, the travel companies were &quot;dealers&quot; because they received the consideration paid by the hotel guests for the right to occupy the hotel accommodations and as such, were required to collect and remit the TDT on the total consideration paid for the room by the guest. The appellate court held that the complaint alleged a present and practical need for declaratory relief. The claim was not abstract and the county was not bringing the action to challenge the laws governing TDT. As to exhausting remedies, it was illogical to require the parties to submit to the cumbersome, expensive process associated with a tax collection action when such process may prove to be entirely unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order dismissing the complaint was reversed. The matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee car buyer filed a class action suit against appellant auto manufacturer, alleging defects in a model of car, and asserting claims under a federal statute, the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, and for breach of warranties. The Miami-Dade County Circuit Court (Florida) certified a class consisting of all persons who bought or leased such a car in Florida in the four years before suit was filed. The manufacturer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer alleged the model of car she bought had a design defect that caused premature wear of the brakes. The appellate court held that class certification was improper, as she failed to satisfy the commonality and superiority requirements of Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(b)(3). Proof of deficiencies in her car would not advance the cause of other class members, as (1) there had been design and component changes to the model during the years at issue, and (2) without individual inquiry, there was no way to determine whether the need for a particular repair was due to a defect or other factors. Class members whose cars were satisfactory could not be compensated, as she requested. Nor did common legal questions predominate. The claim under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, &sect;&sect; 501.201-.213, Fla. Stat. (2003), failed on the causation and actual damages elements. For the same reasons, the claims of breach of implied and express warranties and violation of the Magnuson Moss Warranty Improvement Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2301-2312, were flawed. As individual inquiry and many mini-trials would be needed to identify the class, the buyer did not establish the superiority requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's order with the direction that the class be decertified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged taxes assessed by appellee Florida Department of Revenue, contending that &sect; 220.13(1), Fla. Stat. (2004), by which Florida limited net operating loss carryovers to federal net losses under I.R.C. &sect; 172, discriminated against foreign corporate dividends in violation of the foreign Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer's foreign subsidiaries generated most of its sales. As it used the federal deduction method, under &sect; 220.13, Florida treated its carryover losses in a similar method as the U.S. system. The taxpayer asserted that, as losses created by domestic dividend deductions could always be carried over while the foreign tax credit, calculated through the payment of foreign dividends, could not be carried over, &sect; 220.13(1) discriminated between domestic and foreign dividends. The appellate court disagreed. Florida's treatment of foreign dividends under &sect; 220.13(1) was more generous than the U.S. government's, as it offered corporations (1) the subtraction of all foreign source dividends from its income calculation, and (2) the ability to offset taxes owed to Florida through to the use of the foreign tax credit. No disparate treatment of the dividends existed, as Florida did not include foreign source dividends in its income calculation, but offered a corporation the ability to carry over net operating losses resulting from the deduction of foreign taxes paid and the possible deduction of other significant foreign dividends based on those same excluded foreign source dividends.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Marion County (Florida) of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), &sect; 316.193(2)(b)(3) Fla. Stat. (2006), and driving while driver's license permanently revoked (DWLR), &sect; 322.341, Fla. Stat. (2006). The trial court sentenced defendant. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his convictions and sentences were to be reversed because: (1) both the DUI and the DWLR statutes violated the Due Process Clauses of both the United States and Florida Constitutions; (2) the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain a DWLR conviction; (3) the State of Florida presented speculative and unfairly prejudicial testimony through cross-examination of the defense witness; and (4) the State made an unfairly prejudicial and legally erroneous argument to the jury in closing. On appeal, the court found that because defendant's challenges to the application of the statutes to the facts were not raised below, they were not preserved. Similarly, his contention that the statutes violated substantive due process was not preserved for review. Moreover, his sufficiency of the evidence argument was not preserved for appellate review, as the defense made no motion for judgment of acquittal challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. His objection to the cross-examination was also not preserved for appeal. Finally, as no objection was raised below, the court examined the prosecutor's comments and found nothing approaching fundamental error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department alleged the agent sold ancillary insurance products to customers without their informed consent (known as &quot;sliding&quot;), which was grounds to suspend or revoke her license under &sect;&sect; 626.611 and 626.621(6), Fla. Stat. Three customers testified they left the agent's office believing they had purchased only the insurance they requested and did not realize they had purchased additional, optional coverage. An administrative law judge (ALJ) ruled (1) the agent engaged in sliding, an unfair or deceptive practice under &sect; 626.9541(1)(z)3, Fla. Stat. (2004); (2) the Department did not prove her lack of trustworthiness to engage in the insurance business under &sect; 626.611(7), Fla. Stat.; and (3) it did not prove she had engaged in fraudulent practices under &sect; 626.611(9). He recommended a 60-day suspension. The Department accepted the ALJ's first ruling, but reversed the second and third rulings. It concluded that as the agent engaged in intentional wrongdoing, she violated &sect; 626.611(7) and (9). The appellate court held that sliding was not a per se demonstration of unfitness under &sect; 626.611(7), and that the ALJ reasonably found the agent had not engaged in fraud under &sect; 626.611(9).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to felony criminal mischief and was sentenced as a habitual felony offender by the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Indian River County, Florida. He appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Huss v. State precluded the use of a prior conviction for misdemeanor criminal mischief as an enhancement under &sect; 806.13(1)(b)4, Fla. Stat. (1999), because &sect; 806.13(1)(b)4 was not added to the statute until after he had committed that offense. The appellate court noted that a law that increased the penalty for an offense committed after the law was enacted, based on a conviction occurring prior to the law's enactment, was not an unconstitutional ex post facto law. Unlike the statute involved in Huss, &sect; 806.13(1)(b)4 did not add an element to the qualifying offense. Section 806.13(1)(b)4 provided only that if a person had one or more previous convictions for criminal mischief under 806.13(1)(b), the offense under &sect;&sect; 806.13(1) or 806.13(2) for which the person was charged would be reclassified as a felony of the third degree.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Circuit Court for Sarasota County (Florida), defendant pleaded no contest to sexual battery by a person in custodial authority, attempted sexual activity with a child by a person in custodial authority, and lewd, lascivious, or indecent act upon or in the presence of a child under 16 years of age. He appealed from the denial of his motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations of &sect; 775.15(3)(b), Fla. Stat. (Supp. 1990-1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a high school teacher and a swim team coach. The offenses involved students, one of whom was also on the swim team. The court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 775.15(3)(b), which extended the statute of limitations for misconduct in office by a public employee, was unconstitutionally vague. First, the legislature's act of rewriting the statute in 1974 clearly indicated that it did not intend to restrict the extension only to public office holders. The legislature specifically included the word &quot;employee&quot; and referenced &quot;employment.&quot; Next, the fact that the statute did not define &quot;public officer or employee&quot; or &quot;misconduct in office&quot; did not make it unconstitutionally vague. The term &quot;public officer or employee&quot; was clear on its face and needed no definition. The meaning of &quot;misconduct in office&quot; was also not ambiguous. &quot;Misconduct in office&quot; by teachers was defined by Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 6B-4.009(3) as a violation of the Code of Ethics and the Principles of Professional Conduct that was so serious as to impair the individual's effectiveness in the school system. It was not necessary to rely on case law for a definition of the term &quot;misconduct in office.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Art. I, &sect; 22, Fla. Const., required a jury of at least six in criminal cases. Section 913.10, Fla. Stat.

Defendant sought an evidentiary hearing on his motion to present testimony and documentary evidence supporting his argument that a jury of six was inferior in its functioning to a jury of 12. The appellate court held that since the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that the six members provided for by Florida law did not violate a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights, no purpose would have been served by an evidentiary hearing. Neither Florida nor federal law provided any relief for defendant.</SPAN></P>

Stat. (2005), and the misdemeanor of holding oneself out as a massage therapist without a license, &sect; 480.047(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2005). The Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) granted defendant's motion and dismissed the felony counts in each case. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims alleged that, in addition to offering instructions in martial arts, defendant offered &quot;energy sessions&quot; which were, in reality, massage sessions.

Defendant argued that the specific misdemeanor statute governing massage therapists, &sect; 480.047(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2005), controlled over the more general felony statute covering health care professionals, &sect; 456.065(2)(d)1., Fla. Stat. (2005). The appellate court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the felony counts because &sect; 456.065(2)(d), Fla. Stat. (2005) was unambiguous and expressly authorized the State to prosecute an individual under both ch. 456, Fla. Stat., and ch. 480, Fla. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the sexual battery of a mentally disabled adult. The State sought to introduce the adult's statements to his mother. The trial court held the statements were inadmissible because &sect; 90.803(24), Fla. Stat. (2001), was unconstitutional. The intermediate appellate court certified the question to the Florida Supreme Court, which quashed its decision and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of State v. Hosty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In Hosty, the high court held that in determining whether to admit hearsay statements of a mentally disabled adult under &sect; 90.803(24), the courts should consider, inter alia, the spontaneity of the statement, how it was elicited, the ability of the declarant to distinguish between reality and fantasy; the motive or lack thereof to fabricate the statement; the possibility of any improper influence on the declarant; and the mental state of the declarant when the abuse was reported. The intermediate appellate court held that the declarant's private conversation with his mother was nontestimonial within the meaning of Crawford. To admit the statements under &sect; 90.803(24), the State had to establish a proper factual predicate, and the declarant had to either testify or be determined to be unavailable. The trial court had to make specific findings on the record indicating the basis for determining the reliability of the declarant's statements. The declarant's statements to the state attorney interviewer were testimonial and could not be admitted unless the declarant (1) testified at trial, or (2) was determined to be unavailable, and defendant had an opportunity for cross-examination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court's order finding that &sect; 90.803(24) was unconstitutional and remanded the case to the trial court to conduct appropriate inquiries as to the admissibility of declarants statements, including whether the declarant would testify at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a citizens group and another, sued appellees, the Florida Department of State and the Florida Secretary of State, seeking a judgment declaring that ch. 2007-30, &sect; 25, Laws of Fla., and emergency implementing rules enacted by the Department, were unconstitutional. The Leon County Circuit Court (Florida) granted appellees summary judgment. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellants contended that the challenged statute and its implementing rules violated the citizen initiative provisions of art. XI, &sect; 3, Fla. Const. The appellate court agreed. Statutes and administrative rules regulating the citizen initiative process were valid only when their sole goal was to ensure ballot integrity; the challenged statute and rules failed that test. The statute and implementing rules asserted regulatory authority over the citizen initiative process by interjecting the concept of petition signature revocation. Inter alia, they prescribed procedures through which an elector's signature on a citizen initiative petition form could be revoked, provided that an elector who revoked his signature on a petition form could not thereafter sign a new petition in support of the same initiative, and that signatures that were revoked would not be counted towards the requisite number of verified signatures need to submit a proposed constitutional amendment to the electorate. As the statute and rules burdened the initiative process with requirements that were not prescribed by the Florida Constitution, they were invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate suits, appellee medical providers sued appellant insurers under &sect; 627.736(5)(b)5, Fla. Stat. (2003), seeking a Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase in sums payable as personal injury protection (PIP) benefits on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans they provided the insureds. The Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County, Florida, granted the providers summary judgment; the insurers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first provider claimed that under &sect; 627.736(5)(b)5, Fla. Stat. (2001), it was entitled to a CPI adjustment to the Medicare Part B fee schedule for an MRI it provided to an insurer in 2002 based on the 2001 CPI figures. The trial held that under the 2003 amendment to &sect; 627.736(5)(b)5, the MRI inflation adjustment had to be made based on the 2001 CPI. The appellate court agreed. The second provider sought a judgment declaring that the CPI adjustments were annual and cumulative under &sect; 627.736(5)(b)5, and compounded from August 1st, 2002, to the date the MRI scans commenced. The trial court held the 2003 amendment to &sect; 627.736(5)(b)5 required applying cumulative and compounding inflation adjustments for 2001, 2002, and succeeding years, so that the fee schedule amount for the year in question reflected the combined prior year's increases from 2001 through August 1st of the year in which the MRI scan was performed. Again, the appellate court agreed. This construction did not result in an unconstitutional retroactive application of &sect; 627.736(5)(b)5. Rather, it involved application of a statute that became effective October 1, 2003 to an MRI scan performed later in May 2005.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile pled guilty to armed burglary with assault or battery and attempted armed robbery, in return for the trial court's withholding adjudication and three years' probation, conditioned on his serving a year in a pre-trial detention facility. Later, the Duval County Circuit Court (Florida) found he had violated his probation and sentenced him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant violated probation when he and his accomplices broke into a victim's home, he held the victim at gunpoint, and his accomplices robbed the home. He confessed to two or three similar robberies. He was 19 when sentenced. The appellate court held that imposing a life sentence on a juvenile had never, in state or federal courts, been considered per se unlawful. Thus, such a sentence had not become so unique as to be &quot;unusual&quot; under the Eighth Amendment. U.S. courts, not international courts, interpreted the Eighth Amendment. As the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was ratified subject to a declaration of non-execution, appellant had no judicially enforceable right directly arising out of a challenge to the treaty as it would be interpreted by its signatory nations. The life sentence was not grossly disproportionate as applied. After receiving probation--an extremely lenient sentence for a life felony--appellant committed at least two armed robberies and confessed to an additional three. The trial court properly balanced the unlikely possibility of his rehabilitation with the safety of society and did not abuse its discretion in imposing a life sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former pharmacist filed a petition to compel appellee, the Florida Board of Pharmacy, to adopt a rule under &sect; 120.54, Fla. Stat. (2006), allowing his reapplication for licensure  The Board denied his petition, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board permanently revoked appellant's pharmacy after his criminal convictions for federal offenses related to the practice of pharmacy. The Board denied his request to reapply because it had not adopted rules permitting a formerly licensed pharmacist to apply for relicensure. Appellant argued that &sect; 456.072(6), Fla. Stat. (2006), which authorized the Board to adopt reapplication rules, had to be read to require the Board to do so. The appellate court held that as &sect; 456.072(6) granted the Board unfettered discretion to decide whether formerly licensed pharmacists could reapply for licensure, it was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, in violation of the separation of powers provision, art. II, &sect; 3, Fla. Const. The unconstitutional portion was not severable from the remainder of &sect; 456.072(6), Fla. Stat. The context in which &quot;may&quot; was used in &sect; 456.072(6)--&quot;the Board may establish by rule&quot;--did not permit the court to construe it as &quot;shall.&quot; Therefore, the constitutionality of &sect; 456.072(6) could not be salvaged, and, consequently, the Board had no authority to enact rules providing for reapplication for pharmacy licenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the Board's order denying appellant's petition to initiate rulemaking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to racing on a highway (&sect; 316.19(2)(a), Fla. Stat. (2005)) and vehicular homicide (&sect; 782.071(1), Fla. Stat. (2005)). He appealed, contending the Escambia County Circuit Court (Florida) erred by denying his motion to withdraw his plea to vehicular homicide, and that &sect; 316.19(2)(a), Fla. Stat., was vague and facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another driver began to drag race at a high rate of speed. The other driver's car struck a median, spun, and hit two trees; his passenger died. Defendant argued he was entitled under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.170(f) to withdraw his guilty plea to vehicular homicide because the charge was not supported by the element of causation. He argued that as the passenger voluntarily participated in the race, she caused her own death; in the alternative, the other driver was the cause as he refused to slow down and merge as he approached the median. The appellate court disagreed. There was no evidence the passenger played an active role in the race, or even acquiesced in the other driver's decision to race. It was foreseeable that the other driver would accelerate and try to pass defendant, as they were engaged in a high speed race. As defendant intended to outdistance the other car and be the first to arrive at a given destination, this conduct, combined with the fact that he refused to let the other car pass, was clearly &quot;racing&quot; as defined by &sect; 316.19, and was expressly prohibited by &sect; 316.191(2)(a). Thus, &sect; 316.191(2)(a) was facially valid, not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 101.46 authorized the impoundment of vehicles used in the commission of certain misdemeanors. Appellant argued &sect; 101.46 violated due process and the separation of powers. It relegated the issue of the propriety of an impoundment to a municipal agency without affording the aggrieved person a right to trial by jury in a court. The ordinance created a police court exercising judicial powers in violation of the Florida Constitution's separation of powers provision. It did not insure that a neutral magistrate presided over an impoundment case and it minimized the quantum of evidence necessary to sustain impoundment. It provided no criteria to apply to fix the amount of the &quot;administrative fee&quot; to impose for return of the impounded vehicle. The instant court held that so much of &sect; 101.46 as provided for administrative hearings before city officials on whether there was probable cause to impound a vehicle and the amount of any fee to obtain a return of it was unconstitutional as violating the separation of powers, Art. II, &sect; 3, Fla. Const., and due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant offender was given early release and committed to civil confinement pending a final Florida's Jimmy Ryce Act (JRA) determination. Appellee Florida Parole Commission (FPC) terminated his early release. The JRA action was dismissed, but he did not receive credit for time served while under JRA detention. The Palm Beach County Circuit Court (Florida) denied his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion to correct an illegal sentence. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the offender had been confined in a JRA facility for more than four years, the State Attorney dismissed the JRA case and the FPC revoked his conditional release. The State moved the offender back to his prison without counting against his sentence the four-year long JRA hold. The offender never appealed the FPC's revocation or the Florida Department of Corrections' (DOC's) refusal to credit the JRA confinement. The appellate court held that under Rule 3.800(a), the motion court lacked jurisdiction to grant relief at this point. The failure of the DOC to credit unforfeited gain time did not make the sentence allowing credit for prison time illegal; the prisoner's remedy was not under Rule 3.800, as his sentence was legal when imposed. His remedy for the unlawful administration of his sentence, which he did not pursue, had been within the DOC, whose decision would have been subject to judicial review by appropriate writ. However, he was entitled to JRA credit, since there was no meaningful distinction between  incarceration in jail and state-enforced confinement in a mental hospital. The appellate court presumed that the DOC and FPC would follow the law that it had announced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles denied appellee applicant's request for license reinstatement, ruling that under &sect; 322.271, Fla. Stat., his four convictions for driving under the influence (DUI) precluded reinstatement. He filed a declaratory judgment action. The Orange County Circuit Court (Florida) granted him summary judgment, ruling that amended &sect; 322.271(4) was void ab initio. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Former &sect; 322.271, Fla. Stat. (1997), was amended by ch. 98, &sect; 223, Laws of Fla., to delete a provision that allowed a person with four DUI convictions to apply for reinstatement of his or her driving privileges. The state high court held that ch. 98, &sect; 223, was unconstitutional for violating the single subject rule, art. III, &sect; 6, Fla. Const. The legislature then enacted ch. 03, &sect; 25, Laws of Fla., to cure this defect. The trial court held that ch. 03, &sect; 25, did not cure the single subject defect. Therefore, the version of &sect; 322.271, Fla. Stat., in effect before enactment of ch. 98, &sect; 223, Laws of Fla., applied, and the applicant was entitled to seek reinstatement. The appellate court disagreed. The single subject rule violation contained in ch. 98, &sect; 223, was cured by the enactment of ch. 03, &sect; 25, Laws of Fla. Accordingly, the amended version of &sect; 322.271(4), Fla. Stat., became operative on the effective date of ch. 03, &sect; 25, Laws of Fla., and the applicant had a window period, which closed on that date, to obtain reinstatement of his license from the Department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board's witnesses testified that the school's application failed to set a goal of attaining an A, B, C, or D grade; that its standard that students who scored at or above the 25th percentile on norm referenced tests demonstrated acceptable performance was lower than the State's standard; and that the application lacked evidence of sound financial planning. The board denied the application on these grounds. The Commission ruled that the board had established that the application was deficient in the area of student assessment/accountability, but that this was not good cause for denial. The Department affirmed. The appellate court held that neither &sect; 1002.33(6)(a), Fla. Stat., nor the Florida charter schools standard application required a charter school to include a school grade. The school had rebutted the board's claim that it was statutorily deficient in the finance/class size requirement. The Department's authority under &sect; 1002.33(6)(c) to approve or deny a charter school application did not violate the authority of district school boards under Art. IX, &sect; 1(a), Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Indian River County (Florida) that convicted him of aggravated fleeing or eluding an officer under &sect; 316.1935(3), Fla.

Another officer followed defendant and observed him drive 15 to 20 miles an hour over the 35-mile an hour speed limit and run several stop signs. The appellate court found that because the pursuing officer testified that he did not have lights and sirens on while chasing defendant, there was insufficient evidence of high speed or wanton disregard to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded to reduce defendant's conviction to simple fleeing or eluding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a paternity and child support action, the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), granted appellee father's motion to determine child support arrearages, payment thereon, and to set aside writ and passport release. Thus, appellant, the Department of Revenue, who had filed the instant action on behalf of the two mothers involved, sought further review, and the cases were consolidated for appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Revenue (DOR) argued that the trial court lacked the authority to lift federally mandated restrictions on the father's passport because the record reflected that his combined delinquency in the consolidated appeals was $ 37,313, which exceeded the $ 2,500 threshold established by federal law. The Court of Appeals agreed. Specifically, pursuant to &sect; 409.2564(10), Fla. Stat. (2006), the DOR had the authority to certify to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that an individual had child support arrearages and might be eligible for passport restrictions. Second, Florida case law held that the trial court was prohibited from interfering with, and lacked the authority enter into, the decision-making process of a state agency. Further, the DOR had not deemed the arrangements created by the trial court to be acceptable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a Georgia juvenile, sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) in which the circuit court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to consider appellant's Parental Notice of Abortion Act, &sect; 390.01114(4)(a), Fla. Stat. (2007), petition for judicial waiver of parental notification of the termination of a pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court determined that it did not have jurisdiction because the minor did not reside within the jurisdiction of the court. Appellant argued that the circuit court erred as a matter of law in holding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the petition. Appellant asserted that when a minor was a nonresident of the state, Florida law compelled a conclusion that she might file a petition for judicial waiver in any circuit court in the state. The appellate court agreed. Contrary to the circuit court's ruling, &sect; 390.01114(4)(a) was a venue statute, not a jurisdictional statute. As the statute was silent on the venue in which an out-of-state party was to file a petition, no specific venue was preferred, and the circuit court's decision was error. However, based on the time limits set forth in the Act, a remand for a new hearing before the circuit court was not authorized. As a result, the appellate court, before issuing its written opinion, had directed that the circuit court immediately issue an order granting the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the circuit court's dismissal of the petition and remanded with directions that the circuit court forthwith enter an order granting the petition and directing the clerk of the circuit court to place a certificate to that effect in the file and provide appellant with a certified copy of that certificate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the sentence she was given after she entered an open plea in the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, St. Lucie County (Florida), on one count of grand theft of property valued at more than $ 100,000 and one count of fraudulently obtaining property valued at more than $ 50,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stole money from her employer by misusing a corporate credit card. Although her prison sentence was authorized by the criminal punishment code, defendant argued that she was unconstitutionally being imprisoned because of her inability to pay restitution. A co-employee, who also stole from the employer, was given probation after making full restitution of the amount he had taken. The appellate court affirmed. Direct appeal of a sentence was limited by &sect; 921.002(1)(h), Fla. Stat. Further, assuming that the holding in the case defendant relied on to support her direct appeal was correct, the appellate court agreed with the State's arguments that defendant's case was distinguishable. Unlike the co-defendants in the case defendant relied on, defendant and her co-employee were not co-defendants; their thefts were done individually. Further, defendant was charged with a higher degree of felony than the co-employee. Finally, the charges against the co-employee were not dropped upon the payment of restitution; he simply received a different sentence based upon his plea. The appellate court found no constitutional violation that would make defendant's sentence appealable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city appealed, and appellee vehicle owner's cross-appealed, from an order of the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida), which granted the vehicle owners' motions for injunctive relief, rejecting many of the vehicle owners' arguments, but finding that Miami-Dade County, Fla., Code &sect;&sect; 42-120-124 (1997) was unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the city's vehicle impoundment ordinance was unconstitutional for three reasons: (1) it failed to provide adequate notice; (2) it applied an incorrect standard of proof; and (3) it failed to satisfy due process requirements by not providing an innocent owner defense. The ordinances did not clearly require that notice be promptly given to owners who were not at the scene of the impoundment. Additionally, the ordinance did not require any notice to lessors, renters, and lienors. Also, the ordinance was constitutionally infirm because it called for a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof. Deprivation of property and the assessment of fines called for the higher standard. Impoundment was analogous to a forfeiture, which required the government to prove, by no less than clear and convincing evidence, that the property being forfeited was used in the commission of a crime. Finally, although mindful that impoundment was not equivalent to forfeiture, the court did not believe that an ordinance that did not allow for an innocent owner to be immune from loss of property and additional monetary penalties could satisfy due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed after being convicted in the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) of fleeing to elude a law enforcement officer at a high speed or with wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property in violation of &sect; 316.1935(3)(a), Fla. Stat. (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the jury instruction was fundamentally flawed as it might have deprived him of a unanimous jury verdict. Among other things, the jury instruction required the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that during the course of the fleeing or attempting to flee, defendant drove at a high speed or in any manner demonstrating a wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property. Defendant contended if some of the jurors concluded that he fled at a high speed, while others believed that he endangered persons or property while fleeing, he was deprived of a unanimous verdict. The appellate court disagreed. There were two ways to prove defendant guilty under &sect; 316.1935(3)(a). Defendant was found guilty under a general verdict. While the general verdict could have rested on a theory of liability without adequate evidentiary support, reversal was not warranted because there was an alternative theory of guilt for which the evidence was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), of committing lewd or lascivious battery under &sect; 800.04(4)(a), Fla. Stat. (2004) and lewd or lascivious conduct under &sect; 800.04(6), Fla. Stat. (2004). The court sentenced defendant, in accordance with the Florida Dangerous Sexual Felony Offender Act, &sect; 794.0115, Fla. Stat. (2004), to two concurrent life terms. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the Florida Dangerous Sexual Felony Offender (DSFO) Act was unconstitutional on its face because it provided no statutory notice, no separate hearing, and no standard of proof. On appeal, the court found that, as the DSFO Act was passed prior to defendant's commission of his second offenses, he was on notice of the increased penalty attached to his criminal conduct. He also had notice and an opportunity to be heard on his sentence as the sentencing hearing provided for in Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.720 satisfied defendant's due process opportunity to be heard on his DSFO sentence. Moreover, Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.713 required the disclosure of prior convictions to defendant in advance of the sentencing hearing. Although the DSFO Act did not provide a standard of proof, there was no impediment to its constitutionality for this omission. Finally, there was clearly competent substantial evidence to support the sentencing. However, defendant's conviction for lewd or lascivious conduct under &sect; 800.04(6), Fla. Stat., did not qualify him for sentencing pursuant to the DSFO Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence for the lewd or lascivious conduct count was reversed, and the case was remanded for resentencing. The conviction and sentence on the lewd or lascivious battery count was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee agency filed a petition for the involuntary termination of appellant mother's parental rights. The mother did not appear at the adjudicatory hearing. The Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) ordered entry of a consent by nonappearance on the mother's behalf and rendered a judgment terminating her parental rights as to her child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother claimed that she did not attend the adjudicatory hearing due to the financial hardships she faced in traveling from New Hampshire, in addition to demands of her job, new child, and ill father in New Hampshire. The appellate court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in terminating the mother's parental rights as to her child, pursuant to &sect; 39.801(3)(d), Fla. Stat. (2005), or refusing to set aside the consent. The trial court found that the mother's testimony lacked credibility based on its inconsistencies and contradictions. It concluded that the mother did not make a reasonable effort to be present at the hearing because she did not attempt to contact her attorney or the trial court to explain her circumstances or otherwise attempt to arrange for transportation and alternative care for her father. The findings were supported by the mother's own testimony at the hearing regarding her lack of preparation and her testimony that she actually forgot about the important court date. The trial judge made credibility determinations based upon his observations of the mother's demeanor and his assessment of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mobile home park owner sent notices of eviction to all of the mobile home park residents.

The mobile home owner claimed that the mobile home park owner did not act in good faith in accordance with &sect; 723.021, Fla. Stat., because the eviction notice required the mobile home owner to abandon her mobile home prior to the rezoning and a finding by a governmental body that other suitable facilities existed for the mobile home owners, which she alleged was required by &sect; 723.083, Fla.

Stat., inapplicable to change of use evictions, the trial court correctly determined that the statutory obligation which the mobile home owner asserted that the mobile home park owner violated did not exist.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contractor petitioned for review of an immediate final order by appellee, the Department of Financial Services of the State of Florida, which, pursuant to &sect; 120.569(2)(n), Fla. Stat. (2006), ordered the contractor to cease and desist from analyzing insurance policies or counseling or advising or giving opinions as to insurance policies or otherwise acting as a general lines insurance agent without being properly licensed and appointed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor was a Florida licensed building contractor who operated a mold remediation company. He was not and never was a Florida licensed insurance agent. The immediate final order (IFO) found that the contractor was engaging in the unlicensed and illegal business of analyzing homeowner's insurance policies and counseling, advising, and giving opinions relative to homeowner's insurance. However, the IFO contained no factual allegation that the contractor engaged in or was holding himself out as engaging in business as an insurance agent. According to the IFO, the contractor analyzed four homeowners' insurance policies and advised the homeowners that his services were covered under their policies. As a result of that assurance, the homeowners hired the contractor. However, the insurance companies would not pay the contractor. When the homeowners did not pay their bills, the contractor filed a claim of lien against their properties. On appeal, the court found that the Department issued a facially deficient IFO which failed to demonstrate that the complained of behavior would continue, and that an emergency order without a hearing was necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged, along with co-defendant with one count of aggravated child abuse in violation of &sect; 827.03(2)(b), Fla.

Both were found guilty as charged. Upon appeal, the appellate court directed the trial court on remand to enter judgment against defendant for child abuse under &sect; 827.03(1), which the trial court did. No direct appeal was taken from the new conviction and sentence. The appellate court determined, in regard to co-defendant's appeal, that because the jury was not instructed on the lesser included offense of simple child abuse at the original trial, retrying him for simple child abuse would violate his right to be protected from double jeopardy. The appellate court held the previous jury determination that defendant was guilty of aggravated child abuse, i.e., that she maliciously punished the child, could not be deemed to include a jury finding that she was guilty of every element of the permissive lesser included offense of child abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), defendant, a state senator, was convicted of grand theft under &sect; 812.014(2)(c)(2), Fla. Stat. and of using the services of a state employee during working hours in furtherance of a political campaign under &sect; 106.15(3), Fla. Stat. (2004). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With regard to the theft charge, the State alleged that the State had paid one of its employees to work for three months as a legislative aide when she was in fact working for defendant's re-election campaign. No witness testified that defendant knew that the aide was continuing to receive her state salary. The court held that the circumstantial evidence was insufficient to prove that defendant knew that the aide was receiving a state paycheck. Even if defendant had been negligent in allowing the aide to handle her own payroll submissions, a criminal conviction for theft could not stand based upon negligence in handling office procedures. Next, although &sect; 106.15 would be overbroad under the First Amendment and in violation of substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Art. I, &sect; 9, Fla. Const. if it could be read not to include a guilty knowledge or mens rea requirement, criminal statutes were generally read to include such a requirement. The jury, however, had not been instructed on mens rea as requested. This error was not harmless, as a key witness's testimony was contradicted by other evidence as well as by testimony that the witness was biased against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed both convictions and remanded with directions that defendant be acquitted on the felony charge. On remand, the State could retry defendant on the charge under &sect; 106.15(3), Fla. Stat.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the denial by the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) of his motion to dismiss an information charging him with failure to report at a driver's license office in violation of &sect; 943.0435(9) and (3), Fla. Stat. (2006). Defendant argued that the statute violated his right to equal protection by requiring him to register as a result of an offense he committed in West Virginia, while exempting Florida sex offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a sex crime in West Virginia and was required to register as a sex offender there. Following a move to Florida, he was advised by law enforcement of his registration obligation. After several months passed he was charged with failing to report as a sex offender in violation of &sect; 943.0435(9) and (3). After the denial of his motion to dismiss, he pled no contest to the charge. The appellate court held the statute did not treat him differently from similarly-situated persons. &sect; 943.0435(1)(a)1. and 2., Fla. Stat. did not treat in-state and out-of-state sexual offenders differently. As he was required to register in West Virginia, he was subject to &sect; 943.0435(1)(a)2. when he remained in Florida for more than five days. He was treated the same as other similarly-situated sex offenders, moving into Florida or already living in Florida, who were required to register in other states. Thus, he did not show that &sect; 943.0435 treated him differently from any other similarly-situated sexual offender, or that it intentionally discriminated against him. &sect; 943.0435, Fla. Stat. did not offend equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida) convicted defendant, on his plea of nolo contendere, of carrying a concealed firearm and possession of marijuana, but defendant reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress the evidence found in his car as a result of a traffic stop for a broken tag light. Thus, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 316.221(2), Fla. Stat.

He further alleged that as long as he had a single operational light and the tag was clearly legible, he was not in violation of &sect; 316.221(2) and the officer did not have probable cause to stop him. The appeals court agreed. Moreover, despite the State's contrary contention, the stop was not proper under &sect; 316.610(1), Fla. Stat. (2004), as it failed to show that defendant's car was not equipped as required by law, and it made no attempt to establish that the car was unsafe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner jail detainee sought a writ of habeas corpus from an order rendered in the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), granting the State's motion for a hearing under U.S. v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a review of the evidence and controlling law in light of the detainee's request, the instant court first found that the motion filed by the State, and the order entered by the court granting that motion, were authorized by &sect; 903.046(2), Fla. Stat. (2007) and Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.131(b), and as such, the issue as to the applicability of Nebbia, a federal case, was beside the point. Second, despite the detainee's contrary claim, the appeals court could not agree that the drug trafficking charges filed herein precluded a court from looking into the source of the funds the detainee might use to post bond. Finally, the detainee raised numerous constitutional arguments, but failed to cite to any case which would support the unconstitutionality of the circuit court's order. Thus, the issue was premature and could be addressed, if necessary, by the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a personal injury action alleging vicarious liability, the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) granted final summary judgment to appellee car rental agency (agency) on their defense of the federal Graves Amendment, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106, as a complete bar to the claim asserted. Thus, appellants, the alleged injured parties, sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged injured parties first asserted that the trial court misinterpreted a provision of the Graves Amendment that limited the preemptive reach of the statute and preserved certain vicarious liability provisions under preexisting Florida statutory and common law. Second, they claimed that the Graves Amendment was unconstitutional. But, the appeals court disagreed with both claims, as the instant court previously upheld the preemptive language of the Graves Amendment, as applied to &sect;&nbsp;324.021(9)(b)(2), Fla. Stat. (2005). As a result, the Graves Amendment abrogated the agency's vicarious liability in this case. Second, the instant court declined to follow other reported cases that concluded that the Graves Amendment was outside of the Congressional powers created by the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution and, therefore, unconstitutional, opting instead to hold that motor vehicle leasing transactions unquestionably affected the channels of interstate commerce, the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and intrastate activities substantially related to interstate commerce. Thus, the court could not strike a Congressional enactment for local interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), convicted defendant of selling cocaine within 1,000 feet of a place of worship. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying him the first and rebuttal closing arguments during his October 19, 2006, trial. He asserted that &sect; 918.19, Fla. Stat. violated the separation of powers provided in Art. II, &sect; 3, Fla. Const. The appellate court found that, although the legislature's repeal of the portion of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.250 relating to first and last closing arguments was effective, having been passed by a two-thirds majority of each house, its attempt to substitute a different procedure was not. The trial occurred after adoption of the statute, but before the promulgation by the Supreme Court of Florida of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.381, which amended Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.250. Thus, the case involved a repealed Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.250, without a replacement rule. In such a situation, the common law applied. No intolerable hiatus resulted because the common law supplied the order of closing arguments. Further, the later adoption of the amended rule undermined the position that a &quot;hiatus&quot; was created, as both the amended rule and the common law conformed precisely to &sect; 918.19, Fla. Stat. The trial court properly decided the order of final arguments.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that (1) the school board failed to preserve the record issues; (2) the failure of the State Board to include a fact-based justification for its decision was not reversible error under &sect; 1002.33 Fla. Stat. (2005); (3) competent substantial evidence supported the Commission's conclusion that the school board did not have good cause to deny the application pursuant to &sect; 1002.33(6)(a) (2005); (4) the Commission had sufficient evidence to properly conclude that, although the application was statutorily deficient, such a deficiency was not good cause for denial of the application when the academy recognized the problem and was willing to correct it; and (5) &sect; 1002.33, Fla. Stat. did not violate the provisions of Art. IX, &sect; 1(a), Fla. Const.; Art. IX, &sect; 4(b), Fla. Const.; and Art. IX, &sect; 2, Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>

They further asserted that &sect; 197.522, Fla. Stat., which governed notice to an owner when application for tax deed was made, was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted twice for possession of cocaine and twice for sale of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a place of worship by the Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida). Defendant contended his right not to be convicted more than once for the same offense was twice violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An informant gave defendant $ 100 in exchange for about five or six rocks of crack cocaine. An undercover deputy sheriff then came over and purchased additional cocaine. The sale to the informant took about 10 seconds. The second transaction occurred approximately 15 seconds later. The appellate court held that although defendant sold cocaine to two different individuals, both the confidential informant and the undercover agent were acting in concert and as agents of the same buyer. While defendant's two convictions for sale of cocaine in violation of &sect; 893.13(1)(e), Fla. Stat. (2004) indisputably contained identical legal elements, the two convictions arose from two factually separate and distinct sales of cocaine, sales which could be punished separately without violating double jeopardy prohibitions. Defendant had time to pause, reflect, and intentionally commit an additional crime after his sale to the informant was fait accompli. Having completed one sale, he agreed to sell a separate quantity to the deputy sheriff for a separate, additional sum of money. The two physically distinct sales constituted separate criminal acts that could be separately punished.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentences and one of his convictions for possession of cocaine were reversed and remanded for resentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant &quot;putative father&quot; sought review of a final administrative child support order entered against him by the Florida Department of Revenue, Child Support Enforcement Program (DOR). The putative father argued, inter alia, that the administrative judge who heard the child support matter lost jurisdiction when the putative father filed an answer disputing paternity and requested DNA testing to determine whether he was the child's father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DOR commenced an administrative proceeding against the putative father alleging that his paternity had been legally established by affidavit or voluntary acknowledgment as to a minor child. The putative father filed an answer denying the allegations which included an unsworn response requesting DNA tests. The answer did not request a hearing. The putative father did not respond to a proposed support order, and a final administrative child support order was entered. The putative father was designated as the father of the child on the child's Florida birth certificate. At the time he answered the administrative notice, Florida's separate statute on disestablishment of paternity, &sect; 742.18, Fla. Stat., was not yet effective. Both &sect; 742.18 and &sect; 742.10(4), Fla. Stat. (2007), provided that a father who acknowledged paternity remained responsible for child support until he established good cause or prevailed in his own action in circuit court to disestablish paternity and terminate the payment obligations. Neither of those circumstances occurred. The paternity statutes afforded him a remedy to disestablish paternity and terminate his child support obligations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the DOR was affirmed but without prejudice to the putative father's right to commence an action to disestablish paternity.</SPAN></P>

Stat., and lewd or lascivious conduct in violation of &sect;&sect; 800.04(6)(a) and 800.04(6)(b), Fla. Stat. (2004). Following his conviction, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant went to a police station for questioning. He acknowledged receiving Miranda warnings. His mother was present during the interview. The interview was digitally recorded and entered into evidence at trial. Additionally, the trial was set over a year after a public defender was appointed. The case was continued or reset three times before substitute counsel filed an appearance and two times afterwards. The trial judge scheduled jury selection on 24-hours notice, four days before a Monday trial date that was set six weeks before. Defendant alleged due process violations under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;9. On appeal, the court found that the trial court gave defense counsel sufficient notice before requiring him to begin his part of the voir dire. After two continuances and three months on the case, counsel had sufficient time to have prepared for jury selection. Further, there was no due process violation in the trial judge simply overruling defense counsel's objection and failing to hold a voluntariness hearing outside the jury's presence prior to admission of the DVD as counsel merely made a perfunctory objection as to voluntariness before the DVD was admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sarasota County Circuit Court (Florida) entered a final judgment in a declaratory action, which upheld the constitutionality of an amendment to the Sarasota County charter that had been sponsored by appellee political action committee and set forth detailed election requirements to be implemented in a specific county in the future. Appellant government representatives appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The political action committee sponsored an amendment to the Sarasota County charter that detailed election requirements to be implemented in the county in the future. The government representatives filed a complaint seeking a declaration of the constitutionality of the proposed amendment because they believed that the amendment was preempted by state law or conflicted with state law. The trial court ordered that the amendment be placed on the ballot for an upcoming general election. The electorate then approved the proposed amendment, which would become effective over a year thereafter. The trial court entered a final judgment in the declaratory action which upheld the constitutionality to the proposed amendment. On appeal, the appellate court found that the Florida Election Code, &sect; 97.011 et seq., Fla. Stat. (Election Code) was so pervasive that the proposed amendment was impliedly preempted because the Election Code almost completely occupied the election law field in Florida that there was not room for conflicting county law on the subject. It also found that public policy reasons, such as uniformity, dictated that the proposed amendment be found unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court with directions to vacate the trial court's final judgment. Also, the appellate court certified the question to the state supreme court, as a matter of great public importance, whether the state's election law was sufficiently pervasive and whether public policy sufficiently strong, to preclude local laws regarding certain, specified voting matters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Manatee County (Florida) entered a final judgment in the amount of $ 160,000 in favor of appellee day laborer, and against appellant temp agency, finding that the agency violated &sect;&nbsp;448.24(1)(b), Fla. Stat. (2000-2003). The agency thus appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the Manatee County Area Transit System rate of $ 1 for each one-way trip was the prevailing rate for public transportation in the Manatee County geographic area. Thus, it concluded that in order to comply with &sect; 448.24(1)(b), Fla. Stat. (2000-2003), $ 1 was the maximum amount the agency could have deducted from the day laborer's pay, and found that the agency violated the statute on 160 occasions. Hence, in accordance with &sect; 448.25, Fla. Stat., the trial court awarded the day laborer damages in the amount of $ 1,000 for each violation. On appeal from that order, the agency asserted that the final judgment should be reversed because the version of &sect; 448.24(1)(b), Fla. Stat. in effect from 2000 through 2003 was unconstitutionally vague. The appeals court agreed, based on a prior decision rendered by the Fourth District Court of Appeal on markedly similar facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a county property appraiser, sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida), which dismissed with prejudice his complaint under &sect; 195.027(3), Fla. Stat. (2006) and Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 12D-1.005 for a subpoena duces tecum to compel appellee property owner to produce financial records relating to the owner's tangible personal property in the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appraiser alleged that the owner declined a written request to produce documents which were necessary for an accurate determination by the appraiser of the owner's property as of a particular date. Accordingly, he sought issuance of a writ of subpoena duces tecum in order to compel the owner's production of the requested financial records. The trial court granted the owner's motion to dismiss the complaint, finding that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under either &sect; 195.027(3), Fla. Stat. (2006) or Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 12D-1.005 to issue the subpoena. Further, it did not have subject matter jurisdiction in equity because the complaint appeared to have been a type of investigatory tool. On appeal, the court held that the trial court clearly had subject matter jurisdiction to compel the production of the records for taxation purposes under &sect;&sect;&nbsp;194.171(1) and 26.012(2)(c) and (3), Fla. Stat. (2006). The complaint sufficiently stated a cause of action. The owner's claim that the records were not necessary for an accurate value determination was not properly raised in a dismissal motion, which was determined based on the allegations in the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant labor pool company sought review of a non-final order from the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), which granted class certification pursuant to Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(b)(2) and (3) to appellee worker in his action, alleging that the company violated &sect; 338.24(1)(b), Fla. Stat. (2003) of Florida's Labor Pool Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker filed suit against the company, alleging that it violated &sect;&nbsp;338.24(1)(b) by charging its workers in a particular county more than the prevailing rate for public transportation to and from its hiring halls and work sites. He sought injunctive relief and monetary damages. The trial court granted his request for class certification, finding that he satisfied Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(a)(1)-(4) and that injunctive relief might be appropriate. On appeal, the company sought reversal of the certification, asserting that it did not conform to the procedural requirements of Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220 and that the worker could not adequately serve as the class representative. The court found that although the trial court order did not specifically indicate which subsection of Rule 1.220(b) certification was granted under, as required by Rule 1.220(d)(1), the language of the trial court order sufficiently tracked the language in Rule 1.220(b)(2) and (3). Accordingly, it was clear that the action was maintainable under those sections. The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's determination that the worker was suitable to serve as the designated class representative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a television station broadcaster, challenged a temporary injunction entered by the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) that prohibited it from broadcasting the contents of documents obtained from a storage unit leased by appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant came into possession of eighty boxes of appellee's records after they were sold at auction by the owner of a storage facility due to appellee's alleged failure to pay rent. Appellee alleged that the records remained his private property because the storage facility's determination that he had failed to pay was erroneous. The injunction entered by the trial court prohibited only the publication of the contents of medical records of appellee and his family and communications between appellee and his attorneys. Appellee conceded that the injunction operated as a prior restraint on the First Amendment rights of appellant and was therefore presumed unconstitutional. The appellate court held that there were hypothetical situations when publication of sensitive medical records or attorney-client communications might make an actionable invasion of privacy likely; the appellate court could not conclude that the publication of any such records would necessarily meet this threshold merely because of their nature. Speculation could not suffice to rebut the heavy presumption against a prior restraint. Thus, the trial court erred in entering the injunction.</SPAN></P>

The petition committee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Citizens and registered voters disagreed with the city's decision to relocate the city hall and the city library. As a result, they formed a petition committee, which gathered signatures on initiative petitions for ordinances requiring voter approval for the relocations. When the city refused to place their proposed initiative on the ballot, the petition committee sought mandamus relief in the trial court to compel the city to place the initiative on the ballot. The trial court determined that the doctrine of laches barred the mandamus action. Accordingly, the trial court quashed the alternative writ of mandamus it had entered earlier and denied the petition committee's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the appellate court found that an ordinance requiring a vote before city buildings were relocated was the proper subject of a referendum election, and because the city failed to comply with its legal duty to either adopt the petition committee's proposed ordinances or submit them to the electorate, the trial court erring in quashing the alternative writ of mandamus and in denying the petition committee's motion for summary judgment based on the doctrine of laches.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a physician who prescribed prescription drugs for a patient who became the physician's employee. The physician claimed that there was insufficient evidence of drug weight to support the trafficking counts and that the State of Florida was not permitted to have added together the multiple prescriptions over time which the physician wrote for the employee to reach the requisite weight to support the trafficking charges. On appeal, the court found that the prescriptions issued over a three-month period of time did not allow for the aggregation of the amounts of the prescribed controlled substances to support defendant's conviction for trafficking in a Schedule II drug over 28 grams. However, evidence of two prescriptions presented by the employee to a pharmacist at the same time was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for trafficking of a Schedule II drug over 4 grams but less than 14 grams. Finally, defendant's medical practice was an enterprise under &sect; 895.02(3), Fla. Stat., and the multiple convictions of delivery, the trafficking charge, and the Medicaid fraud convictions were sufficient to satisfy the racketeering element of &sect; 895.03(3), Fla. Stat.

The daughter appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter asserted that Florida's elective share statutes,&nbsp;&sect;&sect; 732.201 to 732.2155, Fla. Stat.

On appeal, the court rejected the daughter's assertion that Florida's elective share statutes violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Additionally, the State of Florida had a strong public policy concerning the protection of the surviving spouse of a marriage in existence at the time of the decedent's death. The provisions of the elective share statute thus served a legitimate legislative purpose. Furthermore, the statutes were rationally related to that purpose in that they sought to provide any surviving spouse who had not waived such protections a minority share in the assets of the decedent in the event that spouse did not receive as much through testamentary dispositions. Thus, Florida's elective share statutes were constitutional under Art. I, &sect; 2, Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that the sentence imposed, 20 years for each of the attempted sexual battery and 15 years for the lewd and lascivious act, all to be served concurrently, was lawful. However, a remand was required for the deletion of certain language in the sentencing documents. Because the Florida Sexual Predators Act took effect after defendant's convictions, he could not be designated as a sexual predator under &sect;&nbsp;775.21, Fla. Stat. (1993). As the Jessica Lunsford Act applied only to someone designated as a sexual predator, defendant could not be sentenced under the Jessica Lunsford Act, and references to the Jessica Lunsford Act in sentencing documents had to be stricken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Appellant sought a declaratory judgment to determine whether the criteria in &sect; 5.6.F.5.d(1)-(8) were unconstitutionally vague and whether the city commission properly applied those criteria. The trial court found that &sect; 5.6.F.5.d was constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because the language in &sect; 5.6.F.5.d stating that the city commission &quot;shall consider&quot; the eight criteria was mandatory, the court held that the city commission did not have the discretion to consider factors outside the criteria provided.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee cities filed suit seeking to invalidate three ordinances by which appellant charter county attempted to create an exclusive method of voluntary municipal annexation. The Circuit Court for Pinellas County, Florida, granted the cities summary judgment on grounds the ordinances violated &sect; 171.044(4), Fla. Stat. (2005) of the Florida Municipal Annexation or Contraction Act, &sect;&sect; 171.011-.094, Fla. Stat. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county adopted an ordinance that provided the exclusive method for voluntary annexation, delineating areas eligible for municipal annexation. The trial court held that a charter county could not adopt an exclusive method of voluntary municipal annexation under &sect; 171.044(4). The appellate court disagreed. Under the plain language of &sect; 171.044(4), a county could provide for such a method. It rejected the cities' argument that the legislature expressly or impliedly preempted Florida counties' authority to do so. However, &sect; 171.044's voluntary annexation provisions did not apply to municipalities in counties with charters that provided for an exclusive method of municipal annexation. Thus, under &sect; 171.044(4), the method of annexation had to be set forth in the charter; a charter county could not delineate the process in an ordinance. A charter county's exclusive method of voluntary municipal annexation was ineffective where, as here, it was not set forth in the charter and approved by the voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that the trial court was reluctant to require a bond as there was no pending lis pendens.

The cases were distinguishable in that they both involved existing liens that the courts permitted to be transferred to bonds. The buyer cited no authority that would authorize requiring a bond to be posted in order to maintain a lawsuit under these circumstances. The order requiring a bond, which was not related to a lis pendens, violated the minority shareholder's constitutional right of access to the courts under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed. The legislature vested broad discretion in the trial courts of Florida to determine the best interest of children sought to be adopted, and did not limit the traditional trial court's discretion. Ch. 63, Fla. Stat. did not require a trial court to enter a final judgment of adoption upon a determination that the persons seeking adoption were fit to rear the child, to the exclusion of other factors that impacted the child's best interest and might have dictated, in the discretion of the trial court, a disposition other than adoption. Here the trial court heard extensive testimony relating to the children's best interest and concluded their best interest compelled that the adoption should be denied. This was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with racing on highway under &sect; 316.191, Fla. Stat. (2005) and filed a motion to dismiss challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida) granted the motion and found &sect; 316.191&nbsp;unconstitutional on both vagueness and overbreadth grounds. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer saw defendant driving his car at a high rate of speed. Another vehicle was following behind defendant's vehicle at a high rate of speed. The vehicles were not driving side by side. The vehicles, among other things, were weaving through traffic. The trial court found that &sect; 316.191, Fla. Stat. on its face and as applied was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The appellate court agreed that the statute was vague. The definition of &quot;racing,&quot; in part as the use of one or more vehicles in an attempt to outgain or outdistance another motor vehicle, encompassed passing, accelerating from a stop, and countless other legal maneuvers which drivers employed in their daily lives. By failing to include an element of competition, the definition of &quot;race,&quot; encompassed an endless range of otherwise legal conduct, primarily based on the &quot;outgain and outdistance&quot; term, including passing and accelerating from a stop so as to make the scope of proscribed conduct vague. However, the trial court erred by finding &sect; 316.191&nbsp;unconstitutional on overbreadth grounds. Overbreadth was not implicated because the statute did not affect a fundamental constitutional right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment finding that &sect; 316.191, Fla. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate brought a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 case against appellee doctor based on the quality of cream prescribed for the inmate's &quot;itching condition.&quot; The Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Martin County (Florida), found the inmate a vexatious litigant and ordered him to furnish security pursuant to &sect; 68.093(3)(b) Fla. Stat. The inmate failed to furnish security, and the case was dismissed. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that &sect; 68.093, Fla. Stat. violated Art. I, &sect; 21, Fla. Const. The appellate court found a difference of opinion between the inmate and a prison medical staff member as to treatment for the inmate's itching skin condition did not give rise to an Eighth Amendment violation. The $ 600 security required was reasonable on its face, far less than is typically incurred in a civil rights case to cover a defendant's anticipated, reasonable expenses of litigation, including attorney's fees and taxable costs. Section 68.093, Fla. Stat. satisfied the second Kluger test. The compelling state interest behind &sect; 68.093, Fla. Stat. was to prevent vexatious litigation from interfering with the business of the court system, and the provision remedied the problem of meritless litigation in the most effective way and did not restrict the vexatious litigant's rights more than absolutely necessary. The statute subjected the vexatious litigant's case to close, up-front scrutiny, but had no effect on a case that was likely meritorious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation brought an action against appellee county, seeking a judgment declaring Brevard County, Fla., Ordinance 05-60, as amended by Brevard County, Fla., Ordinance 06-18, to be unconstitutional. The Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida) entered final summary judgment in favor of the county. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that Brevard County, Fla., Ordinance 05-60, as amended by Brevard County, Fla., Ordinance 06-18, violated Art. VIII, &sect; 1(g), Fla. Const. The corporation asserted that ch. 791, Fla. Stat. preempted local fireworks regulation. The appellate court disagreed. Contrary to the corporation's argument, the language of &sect; 791.001, Fla. Stat. (2006) was insufficient to support the preemption argument. Neither ch. 791, Fla. Stat. nor the corresponding legislative history created any distinct line to neatly separate enforcement from regulation. If the legislature had a preemptive purpose, it did not make that purpose clear. Local governments, therefore, were free to exercise their lawmaking powers to facilitate enforcement, so long as the local ordinance was not inconsistent with general law. Nevertheless, Brevard County, Fla., Ordinance 05-60 &sect; 8 invaded the exclusive province of the state legislature and judiciary. Brevard County, Fla., Ordinance 05-60 &sect; 10 was in direct conflict with &sect; 791.001, Fla. Stat., and Brevard County, Fla., Ordinance 05-60 &sect; 13 improperly failed to account for permissible uses of fireworks, including ceremonial and military uses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded with direction to the trial court to remand to sever Brevard County, Fla., Ordinance 05-60 &sect;&sect; 8, 10, 13. The trial court was also directed to determine whether Brevard County, Fla., Ordinance 05-60 &sect; 7 was valid. Otherwise, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the State adduced only hearsay to prove the date of his prison release. At the resentencing hearing, the State relied on a &quot;Certification of Records.&quot; The appellate court found that this document was sufficient. The affidavit attached to the records satisfied the requirements of &sect; 90.902(11), Fla. Stat. The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that application of this provision, which became effective after the date of the commission of his offenses, was unconstitutional in violation of the ex post facto provision. Defendant erroneously asserted that prior to enactment of &sect; 90.902(11), Fla. Stat., the State would have been required to present a witness with personal knowledge of his release date from prison. Instead, the State would have been required to present the live testimony of a records custodian. Section 90.902(11), Fla. Stat., in the present context, did not result in a conviction based on less evidence than the law required at the time the offense was committed. The evidence presented to establish his alleged release date from prison did not violate defendant's right of confrontation set forth in the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was referred to the provider for a magnetic resonance image (MRI) following an automobile accident. The provider sought compensation for the MRI, which was actually performed by its lessee, from the insurer pursuant to an assignment of benefits executed in its favor by the insured. The insurer denied payment on the grounds that the amount the provider sought for the insured's MRI was not compensable. The county court granted final summary judgment in favor of the insurer because the provider rendered no professional or technical services at all pertaining to the MRI. The county court also found that the provider's &quot;lease agreement&quot; violated the prohibition against fee splitting and patient brokering in &sect; 817.505(1)(b), Fla. Stat. (2002). The circuit court affirmed. The Court of Appeal found that because the provider neither performed the professional nor the technical components of the MRI itself and contracted the MRI services out to another entity pursuant to a &quot;lease&quot; arrangement, &sect; 817.505(1)(b) was correctly applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted and strictly enforced rigorous restrictions on the design and construction of commercial and residential structures in order to maintain its reputation as a &quot;beautiful city.&quot; The resident lived in a rental home with no garage, and he parked his personal pickup truck on the public asphalt in front of the residence. This conduct violated Coral Gables, Fla., Zoning Code &sect;&sect;&nbsp;8-11 and 8-12, and the resident was found guilty and fines and costs were assessed against him. He brought his declaratory judgment action, challenging the constitutionality of the ordinances. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city, finding that the ordinances were constitutional. On appeal, the court held that there was no lawful basis for the restrictions imposed by the ordinances on city residents' freedom. A truck parking ban contained therein was not related to preserving the residential character of neighborhoods, as the ordinances were not restricted to only commercial vehicles. Further, matters of aesthetics were not within the government's concerns. The court concluded that there was no legitimate reason that supported the validity of the ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter with directions to enter a declaratory judgment in favor of the resident, and to vacate the guilty determination against him for his ordinance violations.</SPAN></P>

Since his sentencing, the inmate had filed a motion for postconviction relief, a motion to correct sentence, and a petition for writ of prohibition, all of which were denied. The gist of his claim was the same as that raised in prior proceedings, which was premised on his view that the State failed to file a petition for delinquency and treat him as a juvenile.

The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County, Florida, granted the owners' and the city's motion to set aside a settlement and entered judgment against the citizens for the settlement amount; it reserved jurisdiction to determine prejudgment interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. All parties, as well as the citizens' attorneys, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens filed a class action suit alleging the city improperly imposed a special assessment and seeking a refund of the assessments. Before a class was certified, they settled with the city. They admitted the settlement was a significant windfall as compared to the refund amount they would have received under a class settlement. The city and property owners sought to set aside the settlement. The trial court found that there was an implied class action requiring judicial approval of the individual settlement for fairness and reasonableness; that the citizens and attorneys breached their fiduciary duties to the class; and that the city committed a unilateral mistake in believing the settlement was class-wide, not for individual claims. Therefore, it rescinded the settlement agreement. The appellate court noted that the amount the citizens received bore no relation to the amount they paid in assessments. There was an implied fiduciary relationship between the citizens, their attorneys, and the class. As the settlement prejudiced the class, the citizens and attorneys breached their fiduciary duty to the class by entering into a settlement that benefitted only seven citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a nonfinal order by the Circuit Court (Florida) which certified a bilateral class action brought by appellee attorneys who were members of The Florida Bar and maintained an office within the jurisdiction of the city. The attorneys challenged the constitutionality of the city's occupational license tax as applied to their practicing law in the city. They sought, inter alia, declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court certified a plaintiff class consisting of all lawyers subject to local occupational license taxes in all municipalities and counties within the State of Florida pursuant to Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(b)(2), (3) and a defendant class consisting of all municipalities and counties within Florida that levied such occupational license taxes pursuant to Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(b)(1)(A). The appellate court held the trial court properly excluded evidence concerning each attorney's income because it was not relevant to any issue at the hearing on class certification. The enactment of the various occupational license tax ordinances under the authority of the same enabling legislation by all of the members of the proposed defendant class provided the requisite &quot;juridical link&quot; that authorized the certification of the proposed defendant class. It did not appear that the city had any interests that were antagonistic to the interests of the other members of the proposed defendant class. The deposition testimony of one of the class attorneys included competent substantial evidence from which the trial court could find that the city was an adequate representative for the defendant class.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the developers' petition was filed more than 30 days after the city's order denying their application, the developers asserted that the time limit was tolled under the Florida Land Use and Environmental Dispute Resolution Act (Act), &sect; 70.51, Fla. Stat. The trial court found, however, that the Act was unconstitutional. The appellate court ruled that this was error. The trial court found that the Act was an unconstitutional infringement on the rule-making authority of the Supreme Court of Florida under Art. V, &sect; 2(a), Fla. Const. However, there were circumstances where a legislative provision which would have been deemed procedural if viewed in isolation would have nonetheless been upheld against a challenge under Art. V, &sect; 2(a), Fla. Const. because of the connection between that provision and substantive provisions adopted by the legislature. Because the procedural tolling provision of &sect; 70.51(10)(a), Fla. Stat., was intertwined with the remainder of the statute, the trial court erred in finding that section unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the State of Florida, petitioned the Circuit Court for Monroe County (Florida), for the involuntary civil commitment of appellant patient as a sexually violent predator under Florida's Jimmy Ryce Act, &sect;&sect; 394.910 through 394.932, Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient challenged the trial court's admission of hearsay evidence regarding an alleged prior offense committed by the patient in another state. The patient attempted to evade prosecution for the alleged prior offense by fleeing to Florida and changing his name. However, he admitted to nearly everything contained in the police reports regarding the incident. On appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion under &sect; 394.9155, Fla. Stat. (2006) in admitting the hearsay evidence regarding the prior offense because (1) the evidence was reliable; and (2) the patient's rights under the Confrontation Clauses of both the United States and Florida Constitutions were not violated as the Confrontation Clauses were limited in application to criminal prosecutions, and were therefore inapplicable to civil commitment proceedings under the Jimmy Ryce Act. Furthermore, based on the substantial unobjected-to evidence that was presented at the trial, any error in the introduction of the objected-to evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor first contended that the Board's order was invalid because it imposed sanctions on her for failure to take actions that the order acknowledged were impossible to perform.

Stat., which the judge's own order specifically acknowledged could not be done, and despite the fact that the doctor was physically unable to comply. Further, it simply defied logic that the doctor's noncompliance would not be excused when she did not know, nor could she have known, that the action taken against her in Virginia had taken place. Second, the doctor correctly asserted that the Board was required to conduct a de novo review of the record, and, by its own admission, it did not do so. This admitted failure amounted to a material error in procedure which made it impossible for the doctor to obtain a fair hearing. It also violated the doctor's right to due process by refusing her the opportunity to present her case, and resulted in an unjust punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the jury instructions were erroneous since they encompassed masturbation or the commission of other lewd acts in the victim's presence, which were not a part of the charged offense or the evidence at trial. Defendant did not object to the challenged instruction at trial, but argued that fundamental error occurred because the jury returned a general verdict, and it was impossible to determine whether the jury convicted him of the charged or uncharged offenses. The appellate court found no fundamental error. The uncharged crimes were never at issue during defendant's trial, and the State never argued or presented evidence that defendant committed those acts. Reversal was not warranted where a general verdict could have rested upon a theory of liability without adequate evidentiary support when there was an alternative theory of guilt for which the evidence was sufficient. Because defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was not apparent from the record, the appellate court declined to consider this issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action between appellant hospital and appellee doctor, the Circuit Court of Leon County (Florida) invalidated the St. Lucie County Hospital Governance Law, 2003 Fla. Laws ch. 372. The hospital appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A contract had been established between the hospital's board of trustees and its medical staff. The appellate court found that 2003 Fla. Laws ch. 372 dramatically altered many of the rights and obligations specified in the contract, thus constituting an &quot;impairment&quot; under Art. I, &sect; 10, Fla. Const. The hospital acknowledged that 2003 Fla. Laws ch. 372 effected an impairment through diminution of the medical staff's contract rights, but argued that the law was valid under a balancing test. But 2003 Fla. Laws ch. 372 was unconstitutional even under this test because the contract impairment was not required to protect the public health, ensure the quality of care at the hospital, or accomplish some other legitimate public purpose. The legislation also unconstitutionally granted a privilege to a private corporation in violation of Art. III, &sect; 11(a)(12). Although 2003 Fla. Laws ch. 372 applied to all hospitals located in St. Lucie County, there were only two hospitals in St. Lucie County and both were controlled by the same private corporation. Thus, the law therefore unconstitutionally granted a substantial privilege to this private corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother filed a petition to modify appellee father's visitation because she planned to move to Texas with the parties' two children. The father moved to enjoin her from removing the children from Florida. The Circuit Court for Hillsborough County, Florida, denied the mother's request to relocate. She appealed, contending that the parental relocation statute, former &sect; 61.13(2)(d), Fla. Stat. (2004), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties had shared parental responsibility; the mother was the primary residential parent. The appellate court did not address &sect; 61.13001, Fla. Stat., which replaced &sect; 61.13(2)(d). It held that &sect; 61.13(2)(d) did not violate the mother's right to privacy under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, as the father, who had shared parental responsibility under &sect; 61.046(15), Fla. Stat., had the same fundamental right as she did to decide where the children lived. As &sect; 61.13(2)(d) required the trial court to consider competing interests, with an appropriate focus on the parents' rights, along with the best interest of the child, it did not violate the right to travel of the parent wishing to relocate. The father's choice to move out of state would not deny the mother access to her children. Thus, to the extent that a primary residential parent had to seek permission to relocate, the parties were not similarly situated; therefore, &sect; 61.13(2)(d) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The trial court properly held that relocation was not in the children's best interest, as it found that the mother failed to show that the proposed move would improve their school, family, or even home life.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner nursing home sought a writ of certiorari seeking review of an order compelling the discovery of documents it claimed to be privileged, in an underlying suit filed against it by respondent personal representative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a review of the record, the court found that the documents ordered disclosed were not discoverable because nursing homes did not fall within the definition of &quot;health care facility&quot; or &quot;health care provider&quot; as contemplated by  Fla. Const. amend. VII, later incorporated as Art. X, &sect;&nbsp;25, Fla. Const.. Thus, the court did not address the nursing home's preemption claim. As the trial court was required to apply the law of Florida's Constitution as codified and clarified in &sect; 381.028, Fla. Stat. (2005), which excluded nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities, in finding that a nursing home was a health care provider and compelling production of the documents at issue, it departed from the essential requirements of law. Further, the erroneous production of privileged and/or protected documents could not be remedied on appeal. Finally, because this was a question of great public importance, the following question was certified to the Florida Supreme Court: &quot;Whether &quot;nursing homes&quot; or &quot;skilled nursing facilities&quot; fell within the definition of &quot;health care facility&quot; or &quot;health care provider&quot; as contemplated by Fla. Const. amend. VII?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Circuit Court for St. Johns County (Florida) civilly committed appellant inmate under the Jimmy Ryce Act, &sect;&sect;&nbsp;394.910-.930, Fla. Stat. (2002), he appealed, alleging that: (1) the trial court erred in admitting unreliable hearsay evidence against him; and (2) &sect; 394.9155(5), Fla. Stat. (2006) violated Art. V, &sect; 2(a), Fla. Const..</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court disagreed with the inmate's claims. First, as the court relied upon the testimony from all three doctors about three disciplinary reports the inmate received, the inmate should have objected to each doctor's testimony, not just one. Having failed to do so, his claim of error in their admission was not preserved. Even if it was preserved, the inmate ignored the fact that the State sought to admit testimony regarding the disciplinary reports under &sect; 90.704, Fla. Stat., which allowed an expert witnesses to testify about facts or data upon which an expert based an opinion, so long as those facts or data were of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the subject to support the opinion expressed. Moreover, there was ample non-hearsay evidence demonstrating a need to commit the inmate. Finally, the inmate's constitutionality challenge was previously rejected by the Second District Court of Appeals.&nbsp;The Confrontation Clauses of both the United States and Florida Constitutions are expressly limited to criminal prosecutions. As such, the constitutional right of confrontation does not bar the admission of hearsay evidence in civil commitment proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While maintaining that the tag light did not work, the State also argued that the validity of the stop of defendant's vehicle did not depend on whether the light worked; the State claimed the stop was valid if the  deputy had a reasonable suspicion that a traffic infraction had occurred. Further, the odor of burnt or burning cannabis detected as the deputy approached defendant provided him with probable cause to search the vehicle. Upon a review of the evidence, the appeals court held that although the trial court concluded that the failure to verify the light's function after stopping the vehicle impaired the accuracy and credibility of the deputy's estimations, it did not matter. The deputy's observation that the light was not working, from forty to fifty feet away, was sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that the taillight was, in fact, inoperable and to stop the vehicle under &sect; 316.221(2), Fla. Stat. (2005), and whether or not the deputy further inspected the vehicle after stopping defendant, it was lawful for him to approach defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee community development district sued appellants, the appraiser and the Florida Department of Revenue, in the Circuit Court for Clay County (Florida), for declaratory and injunctive relief. The court found that properties of the district were exempt from ad valorem taxation for certain tax years, and ruled that the appraiser did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute. The appraiser and the Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district, pursuant to &sect; 189.403(1), Fla. Stat. (1999), was a residential community that owned and operated public recreational facilities, including a golf course, swimming pools, tennis courts, and playgrounds. On appeal, the court found that the properties were used for a proper municipal purpose and were therefore exempt from ad valorem taxation under &sect; 196.199(1), Fla. Stat. (1999). Significantly, the properties were open to the public and were not operated for profit, notwithstanding that they were operated by a management company. Thus, the properties, for exemption purposes, were to be treated the same as parks and recreation opportunities traditionally provided by municipalities, that were explicitly recognized as exempt property. However, the trial court erred by granting an exemption based on the separate and independent ground of disparate treatment because there was not competent substantial evidence to show that the district was treated differently from all, or substantially all, similar properties in the county. Finally, the appraiser had standing, in his defensive procedural posture in the case, to assert that &sect; 189.403(1), Fla. Stat., was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's ruling that the property was exempt from an ad valorem tax was affirmed. The trial court's denial of the appraiser's affirmative defense on the constitutional issue was reversed and remanded for the trial court to address the defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to suppress alleged that the evidence seized amounted to the fruits of an illegal search. The appeals court agreed. First, the testimony presented to the trial court failed to show that an emergency existed. Upon arrival, the deputies found nothing to corroborate the report of a crime. There was nothing suspicious about the residence itself, such as an open door, and the deputies did not determine that there were persons inside the residence who refused to answer the door. Despite the fact that an anonymous 911 call had been placed, the officers were faced with no facts which led them to believe that a crime was afoot or that an exigency existed. Likewise, the inevitable discover rule did not apply, as the contraband seized would not have been discovered by any legal means. Moreover, when defendant opened the door to his residence and stepped outside in response to the deputies' knock, his exchange with them was a citizen encounter, which, in the absence of further detail or corroboration, did not provide the deputies with either reasonable suspicion to detain him, or probable cause to arrest him on the reported battery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion for rehearing of his appeal of a judgment by the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County, (Florida) that resentenced him; defendant claimed that he was not represented by counsel at the sentencing proceeding in violation of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the trial court simply conformed the sentence to a pronouncement by the state supreme court. Because the trial court had no jurisdiction to do otherwise, it performed a ministerial act. Therefore, defendant's presence was not required. The order by the supreme court specified the exact sentence to be imposed: life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for 25 years. The trial court had no jurisdiction to vary from that mandate. Thus, the case was akin to those cases where the appellate court remanded for a trial court to conform the written sentence to its oral pronouncement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Florida Department of Corrections (DOC), appealed the order of the Seventh Judicial Circuit Court for Volusia County (Florida), which enjoined the DOC from engaging in the practice of automatically violating the probation of every sex offender who failed to give an address acceptable pursuant to &sect; 948.30(1)(b), Fla. Stat. (2005), at the time of a scheduled release from incarceration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee probationer was sentenced to a split sentence of seven years' incarceration to be followed by five years of sex offender probation. After completing the incarceration term, the probationer was arrested immediately upon his release from prison on the ground that he had violated a special condition of his probation. The DOC asserted that it had a statutory obligation to report a compliant residence address for each sex offender releasee. At a bond hearing, the trial court realized that the probationer's &quot;violation&quot; was the inability to supply a compliant address prior to leaving prison and questioned the DOC's basis for conducting a warrantless arrest of the probationer immediately upon the expiration of his prison term. The appellate court concluded that the DOC correctly asserted multiple reasons why the injunctive provisions of the challenged order had to be reversed. First, the DOC was not a party to the proceedings and no notice was given to the DOC that such an order was within the contemplation of the court. Nor had the probationer filed any motion or sought injunctive relief. The provisions of the trial court order directed to the DOC were not authorized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injunctive provisions of the trial court's order were vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, Florida's Secretary of State (Secretary), in a suit filed against her by appellants seeking declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of a legislatively proposed revision to the Florida Constitution known as Senate Joint Resolution (SJR) 2394. Appellants thereafter sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed legislation at issue sought to place time limitations on amendments to the Florida Constitution proposed by citizen's initiatives. On appeal, the court upheld the legislation first finding that appellants failed to explain how the ballot title mischaracterized the proposed revision's main purpose. Second, the language sufficiently apprised voters that it dealt with proposed changes to the constitution. Third, the summary and title adequately apprised the electorate that the proposed amendment would serve to establish a cut-off date, 9 months prior to the general election, for the filing of a citizen's initiative petition. Further, although the Secretary failed to publish the notices as expressly required in all Florida counties, the lack of proper notification in only four out of sixty-seven counties was not fatal to the legislation. Finally, it was apparent that &sect; 101.161(1): (1) applied to all similarly situated persons to appellants; (2) did not intentionally discriminate against appellants alone; and (3) passed a rational basis scrutiny. Accordingly, the statute passed muster under the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured person sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) which granted appellee city's motion for a new trial in a personal injury action where the jury verdict was in favor of the injured person. The trial court granted the motion on the ground that two jurors were not qualified to serve because they had previously been convicted of felonies and had not had their civil rights restored.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured person was injured when his motorcycle collided with a city water truck. The trial court qualified the prospective jurors in a central juror assembly room prior to the beginning of the trial. The prospective jurors completed a standard questionnaire. During the voir dire examination, the jurors were not asked any questions about prior felony convictions or their statutory qualifications to serve on a jury. After the verdict, the city moved for a new trial, alleging that two members of the six-person jury failed to disclose prior felony convictions and had not had their civil rights restored. The appellate court accepted, for purposes of analysis, that the jurors concealed their prior felony convictions during the jury qualification proceeding. However, the appellate court held that to the extent the theory that felon jurors had an &quot;inherent bias&quot; had any validity, its applicability was limited to criminal cases. It had no application to civil cases. The city was not entitled to a new trial on account of the jurors' prior felony convictions in the absence of a showing of actual bias or prejudice or that the city did not receive a fair and impartial trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting the city a new trial was reversed. The matter was remanded for the reinstatement of the jury's verdict and the judgment. On remand, the trial court was to conduct further proceedings to dispose of the city's motion for remittitur, its motion to alter or amend the judgment, and the other grounds raised by the city in its motion for new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant client sued appellee attorney in the Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida), for legal malpractice. The jury, in a bifurcated trial, found negligence on the part of the attorney that caused damage to the client. However, the jury awarded no damages to the client. The trial court then rendered a separate judgment awarding costs to the attorney. The client appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client alleged that the trial court erred in awarding the attorney costs for expert witnesses, and erred when it did not enter judgment for the client after the first phase of the trial and award him costs and fees in connection with that phase. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 57.071(2), Fla. Stat. (1999), was an unconstitutional intrusion on the powers of the judiciary, through the Florida Supreme Court under Art. V, &sect; 2(a), Fla. Const., to determine matters of practice and procedure in the Florida Courts. Even if the statute was substantive, it did not apply in the case as it was then restricted to prospective effect. In addition, the client did not show that the trial court abused its discretion as to the amount of the costs which it awarded. Finally, the jury ultimately returned a verdict awarding the client no damages. Thus, the client did not satisfy the third element of his legal malpractice claim as the attorney's actions did not cause the client to suffer any injury. Accordingly, the trial court properly entered a final judgment in favor of the attorney at the conclusion of the proceeding, and the client was not entitled to costs under &sect; 57.041(1), Fla. Stat. (1997).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Alachua County (Florida) dismissed a count of an information charging defendant with using drug paraphernalia to transport cocaine, in violation of &sect; 893.147(4), Fla. Stat. on grounds that said statute was unconstitutional because the statutory term &quot;transport,&quot; as used therein, was overbroad and vague. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a review of the record, the appellate court first rejected the trial court's conclusion that the term &quot;transport,&quot; as used in &sect; 893.147(4), Fla. Stat., rendered the statute unconstitutionally overbroad. As to this issue, it noted that legislation was overbroad when it was drafted in a manner that could be applied to conduct protected by the First Amendment. Because there was no danger of any such constitutionally-protected conduct being impacted in defendant's case, the statute was not overbroad. Second, the court rejected the trial court's conclusion that the same term made the statute unconstitutionally vague. The word &quot;transport&quot; clearly communicated to both law enforcement officers and members of the general public the concept of conveying a thing from one place to another. Although the use of this term in conjunction with the broad statutory definition of drug paraphernalia meant that &sect; 893.147(4) would likely apply to a significant number of individuals who at some point possess such paraphernalia or certain controlled substances or contraband, there was nothing unconstitutionally vague about the term itself or the manner in which it is used in the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) denied defendant's motion for post-conviction relief. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant raised numerous grounds for relief, he only raised three of those grounds on appeal. Finding none had merit, the appeals court upheld the trial court's order. First, at the time defendant's sentence became final, Apprendi did not apply. Moreover, Blakely did not apply because the judgment and sentence were already final when Blakely was decided. Second, defendant was unable to demonstrate any prejudice from counsel's alleged deficient performance and failed to show that the aggravating factors relied upon by the court to impose a heightened sentence did not exist. Nor did defendant allege that, assuming the existence of these aggravating factors, the sentence actually imposed was not within the trial court's discretion. Because the sentences were lawful, the mere fact that the trial court imposed such was not evidence of prejudice resulting from his attorney's failure to timely file the motion to disqualify. Third, defendant failed to establish a structural defect. While defendant alleged that the trial judge could have been disqualified by a timely filed motion to disqualify, he did not show that the judge was actually biased.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The court also certified conflict with Goines and Kleppinger, decisions in the Fourth and Second Districts, respectively, to the extent they interpret the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Lockhart as modifying or supplanting the ineffective assistance of counsel standard set down in Strickland.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee mother filed a petition to terminate appellant father's parental rights pending a stepparent adoption. The petition alleged that the father had abandoned the children, had willfully refused to pay child support, and had been sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. The Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) terminated the father's parental rights. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the father argued that ch. 63, Fla. Stat. was unconstitutional on its face because there was no requirement that termination be the least restrictive alternative. The appellate court held that the least restrictive means test applied to ch. 63, Fla. Stat. involuntary termination proceedings as it had been applied to ch. 39. Fla. Stat. involuntary termination proceedings. There was evidence that the father was incarcerated until 2012, at which time the children would be 14 and 16. The children did not have contact with the father. The guardian ad litem testified, based on personally visiting the prison and interviewing numerous people, that requiring the children to visit the father would have been detrimental to them. The trial court also noted a letter in the court file from the school guidance counselor which expressed the same opinion. Furthermore, the children's stepfather had acted in every capacity as their real father and wanted to adopt them. There was ample evidence that termination of the father's parental rights was the least restrictive means of protecting the children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee handicapped drivers filed a class action against appellant state agencies in the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida), challenging fees imposed by the State of Florida for issuance and renewal of disabled parking permits. The court granted declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, ruling that the fees violated 28 C.F.R. &sect; 35.130(f), a regulation under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. The agencies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The drivers sought to recover fees which they paid that allowed them to park in handicapped spaces. On appeal, the court found that sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment barred an unconsented action against the State of Florida for damages, but did not bar a suit for nonmonetary relief, such as declaratory or injunctive relief. Further, there was no valid barrier to enforcement of 28 C.F.R. &sect; 35.130(f). Thus, the drivers could recover on their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. Additionally, the State of Florida established a statutory procedure under &sect; 215.26, Fla. Stat. (Supp. 1996) (amended) for obtaining a refund of a tax payment where no tax was due. Accordingly, for tax refunds under &sect; 215.26 the State had consented to be sued, and the immunity under the Eleventh Amendment for monetary relief was thereby waived. However, the record did not reveal which drivers, if any, made application for a refund under &sect; 215.26 within the statutory time limit. Finally, the drivers were entitled to appellate attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12205 for that portion of the appellate proceedings reasonably attributable to the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The award of declaratory and injunctive relief was affirmed, but the issue of monetary relief was remanded to the trial court regarding only those claimants who timely applied for a refund. Appellate attorney's fees were granted for that portion of the appellate proceedings reasonably attributable to the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, and the matter was remanded to the trial court to determine the amount of the fees.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida) granted partial summary judgment to both parties. The city appealed. The appraiser and the Director filed a cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that communications towers and certain land were subject to taxation and that a fiber optic network and Internet equipment were exempt under Art. VII, &sect; 3(a), Fla. Const. The court held that the trial court had erred in concluding as a matter of law that the city's use of the fiber optic network and Internet equipment to provide telecommunications services to the public served municipal or public purposes without considering whether the services promoted the goals set forth in &sect; 364.01(3), Fla. Stat. (2002). Next, although the city used the towers for governmental communications, private providers also leased and used spaces on the towers for private business. This contradicted the requirement of Art. VII, &sect; 3(a), Fla. Const. that property be used exclusively by a municipality for municipal or public purposes. Finally, the city argued that the land was being used for the public purposes of providing a buffer between the generating plant and residential development and accommodating future plant retrofitting and/or expansion. The land, however, had been in use for private purposes on both the 2003 and 2004 assessment dates; thus, it was not tax exempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) convicted defendant of dealing in stolen property in violation of &sect; 812.019(1), Fla. Stat. (2001). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged on appeal that the trial court erred by denying his motion to declare &sect;&sect; 812.019(1) (2001) and 812.012(8), Fla. Stat., unconstitutional, and by awarding $ 4,000 in restitution, when the evidence did not support this amount. The appeals court first held that the trial court properly upheld the challenged statutes, as the statutes were not overbroad. A statute's purported overbreadth occurred when that statute criminalized conduct that was otherwise innocent. Because trafficking in any amount of stolen goods was not innocent conduct, the fact that trafficking in a small amount of stolen goods was relatively harmless, as defendant alleged, was of no consequence. Second, defendant's equal protection challenge was rejected. Even if the equal protection clause was implicated, the challenged statutes adequately addressed the State's interest in discouraging and punishing dealing in stolen goods at all levels. Finally, because the restitution amount of $ 4,000 was not supported by the victim's testimony, but instead said testimony supported a loss in the amount of $ 3,125, restitution in that amount should have been ordered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's denial of defendant's motion to declare &sect;&sect;&nbsp;812.019(1) (2001) and 812.012(8), Fla. Stat.&nbsp;unconstitutional was affirmed. But, the restitution order in the amount of $ 4,000 was reversed, and the case was remanded. On remand, a corrected restitution award in the amount of $ 3,125 was to be entered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Florida Department of Education (Department) affirmed decisions by the Palm Beach County School Board (School Board) to deny charters to appellant schools. The schools appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The schools challenged the application and constitutionality of a School Board policy. The appeals court found the challenged policy was valid, affirming the Department's decision. While &sect; 1002.33, Fla. Stat. (2005) was clearly aimed at giving charter schools some measure of academic and administrative freedom, the appeals court did not read this provision to prohibit the School Board from adopting and enforcing policies related to the creation, renewal or termination of the charter schools they sponsor. Such was true because the legislature delegated primary decision-making authority to the school boards over these basic decisions. Second, the &quot;Guiding Principles; Purpose&quot; section of the charter school statute provided sufficient legislative guidance to support the School Board's Policy 2.56. When coupled with the mandatory application requirements, this section saved the legislative delegation from separation of powers problems. Moreover, these statements provided the School Board with sufficient ground to allow it to require an applicant who already owned a school to show that it was an exemplary school before another charter will be granted to the same entity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporation brought a proceeding against respondent personal representative, seeking a writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) seeking quashal of the denial of the corporation's motion to dismiss and the trial court's findings regarding the constitutionality of the Asbestos and Silica Compensation Fairness Act (Act), &sect; 774.201, Fla. Stat. et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation moved to dismiss based on the personal representative's failure to provide evidence satisfying the &quot;prima facie&quot; showing under &sect; 774.204(3), Fla. Stat. The personal representative conceded that she could not satisfy the Act's prima facie showing. However, the trial court ruled that the Act was unconstitutionally retroactive as applied to the personal representative. The appellate court held that the trial court erred. The parties acknowledged that the legislature intended for the Act to apply retroactively. The personal representative, however, argued that the retroactive application of &sect; 774.204(3) divested her of a substantive vested right. The appellate court disagreed. When the personal representative filed her asbestos claim, she was pursuing a common law tort theory. Before the enactment of the Act, the personal representative had, at most, a &quot;mere expectation&quot; that the common law would not be altered by legislation. The personal representative did not have a vested right in her common law asbestos claim. Therefore, retroactive application of the Act was constitutionally permissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was granted, the order under review was quashed, and the case was remanded for entry of an order granting the corporation's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County, Florida, denied appellant juvenile's motion to dismiss a charge of trespass in a school safety zone in violation of &sect; 810.0975(2)(b), Fla. Stat. (2005), he pled no contest to that charge and to resisting arrest; he was adjudicated a delinquent. He appealed, alleging &sect; 810.0975(2)(b) was unconstitutional due to its overbreadth, vagueness, and violation of substantive due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 810.0975(2)(b) barred persons from being in a school safety zone within one hour of school closing or opening unless they had legitimate business or were authorized to be there. A police officer saw appellant walking through his high school's safety zone at 7:25 a.m. on a school day and arrested him. Appellant had twice before been warned against such trespassing. The appellate court held that &sect; 810.0975(2)(b) was not unconstitutionally overbroad. It was designed to primarily regulate conduct rather than pure speech; any applications of the statute that violated the First Amendment could be remedied through as-applied litigation. Appellant lacked standing to raise a facial vagueness challenge to the statute with respect to the hypothetical conduct of others because his own actions fell within the statute's proscriptions. Appellant argued that because the statute could be used to punish innocent activities, it violated substantive due process. The appellate court disagreed. The purpose of &sect; 810.0975(2)(b) -- protecting school children -- was both legitimate and compelling, and the geographical and temporal restrictions it imposed bore a rational relation to its purpose.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court agreed. Further, the juvenile had no reasonable expectation of privacy under the circumstances herein because: (1) the decision to take photographs and to keep a record that might be shown to people in the future weighed against a reasonable expectation of privacy; (2) the photographs which were taken were shared by the two minors who were involved in the sexual activities, and neither had a reasonable expectation that the other would not show the photos to a third party; and (3) the fact that these photographs might have or might not have been shown in no way affected the minor's reasonable expectation that there was a distinct and real possibility that the other teenager involved would at some point make these photos public.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Polk County, Florida, dismissed the suit with prejudice for noncompliance with the nonjoinder statute,&nbsp;&sect; 627.4136, Fla. Stat. (2002). Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's car was involved in an accident with another vehicle; the owner of the other vehicle had an auto policy with the insurer. The permissive user who drove the other vehicle was negligent. The insurer agreed its insured was liable for the accident and paid for repairs to appellant's car. She alleged the repairs were inadequate and sued the insurer. Her complaint did not allege she had obtained a settlement or verdict against either the insured or the permissive user of the other vehicle. She argued that her acceptance of the insurer's oral offer to repair her car was a &quot;settlement&quot; that satisfied one of the two alternative conditions precedent of &sect; 627.4136 for filing a direct action against an alleged tortfeasor's insurer. The appellate court disagreed. A presuit agreement between an injured third party and an insurer about the adjustment of a claim was not a &quot;settlement&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 627.4136(1) because it did not occur within the course of pending litigation in which the insured was already a party. Nor did the complaint allege sufficient facts to plead that the insurer assumed an obligation to appellant that was independent of the insurance contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was found guilty by the trial court, after a hearing, for aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting an officer with violence, and disruption of a school function. In a predisposition report, the Department recommended probation. The trial court placed the juvenile in a moderate-risk residential commitment with the Department, in part because the trial court found that the juvenile was a confirmed gang member, drug user, and likely dealer. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the juvenile met two of the eight criteria set forth in &sect; 874.03(2), Fla. Stat. (2005). Although there was testimony to identify the juvenile as a gang member, there was insufficient evidence to establish any of the other statutory criteria. There was no evidence that the juvenile resided in an area or associated with known criminal street gang members. There was no evidence that the informants who identified the juvenile as a gang member were reliable and their testimony was not corroborated. The trial court erred in relying on the juvenile's alleged gang membership to support a deviation from the Department's recommendation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the borrower made a material misrepresentation to the bank when he did not disclose that he was involved in Federal Trade Commission (FTC) litigation before the closing on the line of credit. The appellate court found that the evidence showed that the FTC litigation severely affected the borrower's income and would have led a reasonable person to conclude that there was a serious problem with the borrower's ability to pay the loan in the future. The loan agreement allowed the bank to suspend the loan if it reasonably believed that the borrower would be unable to repay the loan due to a material change in his financial circumstances. The bank could reasonably have believed that any effect the litigation might have on the borrower's income was substantial and materially affected his financial circumstances. There was substantial competent evidence to support the trial court's findings and no error in its conclusion that the bank had not breached the contract. Because the bank was allowed to waive the provision that the termination must be in writing, the trial court could properly have found that the borrower's oral termination was effective.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County, Florida, revoked defendant's community control under former &sect; 948.03(5)(a)7, Fla. Stat. (1999), for violating a condition of community control that prohibited him from possessing pornography. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant paid a 15-year-old boy to allow him to perform oral sex on the boy. Additionally, he masturbated in the boy's presence. As a condition of community control, he was prohibited from viewing, owning, or possessing any obscene, pornographic, or sexually stimulating materials. Police found in his home a pornographic video and photos of males performing various sexual acts. Defendant contended that, since he was convicted of a sexual offense on a child under 16, the State had to prove that the pornographic materials involved a minor under 16 for a community control violation to be found. The appellate court disagreed. The legislative history of &sect; 948.03(5)(a)7 showed that the legislature did not intend to alter the preexisting ban on all pornographic or obscene material for sex offenders who were on probation or under community control. Thus, the limiting phrase in &sect; 948.03(5)(a)7, &quot;relevant to the offender's deviant behavior pattern,&quot; modified only the words &quot;sexually stimulating material,&quot; and not the terms &quot;obscene&quot; or &quot;pornographic.&quot; Therefore, defendant's community control was properly revoked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner applicant sought a writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), which upheld the denial by respondent, the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, of his request for reinstatement of his driver's license, which was permanently revoked based on his four prior DUI convictions, on hardship grounds as authorized by a statute that was no longer in effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant argued that when the legislature reenacted &sect; 322.271(4), Fla. Stat., effective July 1, 2003, the elimination of the hardship license violated the ex post facto prohibition in Art. I, &sect; 10, Fla. Const., as applied to him. His driver's license was permanently revoked in 2000. On appeal, the court held that because the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Florida Constitutions, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9; U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1; Art. I, &sect; 10, Fla. Const., applied only to criminal legislation and proceedings, and driver's license revocation was not criminal punishment, the amendment eliminating the hardship driver's license, when applied to the applicant who could have sought a hardship license before the amendment became effective, was not unconstitutional as an ex post facto law. Because the court was seeing a number of petitions raising the issue, and anticipated that other districts would also face the issue, the court certified the question of whether the amendment violated the prohibition against ex post fact laws to persons who could have applied for a hardship license before the amendment became effective as one of great public importance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition for certiorari but certified the following question as one of great public importance: whether the amendment to &sect; 322.271(4), Fla. Stat., which eliminated hardship driver's licenses effective July 1, 2003, violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws as to persons who could have applied for a hardship license before the amendment became effective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee customers filed a class action against appellants, the exterminating company and its parent corporation, in the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), for claims arising from the exterminating company's contractual undertakings as to the control of subterranean termites. The court certified a class and one subclass under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(b)(2) and 1.220(b)(3). The exterminating company and its parent corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customers, each of whom entered into a contract with the exterminating company, claimed that they sustained termite damage to their homes caused by the company's deficient performance of its obligations under the contract. The customers made claims of deceptive and unfair trade practices, misleading advertising, criminal racketeering, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment, and for declaratory and injunctive relief. On appeal, the court found that (1) questions affecting individual members of the putative class on the first five claims overwhelmed the common questions arising from the provisions of the contract; (2) the proposed class action did not meet the requirements for certification under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(b)(3) because it was unmanageable; and (3) class certification was not superior to other methods available for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. Thus, the circuit court abused its discretion in certifying the class under Rule 1.220(b)(3). Additionally, because issues pertaining to money damages predominated in the case, class certification of the declaratory and injunctive relief claim under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(b)(2) was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of class certification was reversed, and the case was remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings. On remand, the customers could attempt to narrow the scope of their claims and to modify the proposed class.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners challenged insurance premium rate increases. Appellee, the State of Florida, Department of Financial Services Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR), determined that there was no probable cause showing that appellee underwriting association, the predecessor in interest of appellee insurance company, violated the insurance premium rating law in setting wind damage rates. The property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners asserted two main arguments in the appeal from the OIR's finding of no probable cause. First, they argued that the rate increase was invalid because a public hearing was not held on the underwriting association's rate filing, as provided by &sect; 627.0629(7), Fla. Stat. (1999), and Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 4-166.051(3) (1999) (recodified as Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 69O-166.051). Second, they claimed that the rate increase was invalid because private arbitration to set the underwriting association's rates was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that prior litigation and the case before the court involved the same parties and issues. Further, the prior litigation, which led to an appellate opinion, was fully litigated and determined in a contest which resulted in a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction. Thus, the property owners' claims were barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Additionally, even if the court were to reach the merits, the court was without the authority to order credits or refunds because only the OIR had the authority to do so, not the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Leon County (Florida) entered a final order dismissing appellant minor's petition for a judicial waiver of parental notice of termination of pregnancy. The minor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor asserted that the trial judge improperly disqualified one of her attorneys, thereby depriving her of the counsel of her choice at the hearing on her petition. The appeals court agreed, and found that such error was not harmless. Although the trial judge referenced three authorities for her ruling: (1) the Parental Notice of Abortion Act, &sect; 390.01114, Fla. Stat.; (2) &sect; 27.51, Fla. Stat.; and (3) the &quot;ethical rules,&quot; none of these authorities precluded an attorney who wished to provide private representation in connection with a non-criminal petition for judicial waiver of parental notice of termination of pregnancy from doing so merely because the attorney also served as an assistant public defender in unrelated criminal cases. But, remand for a new hearing was not authorized in proceedings of this type. Hence, having found that there was no necessity for the disqualification of the minor's counsel, it ordered the trial court to grant the minor's petition for a judicial waiver of parental notice of termination of pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the trial judge was ordered to grant the minor's petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Pasco County (Florida) of trafficking in oxycodone, possession of hydrocodone, and obtaining or attempting to obtain a controlled substance by misrepresentation, fraud, forgery, deception, or subterfuge. Defendant was sentenced to a 25-year prison sentence for each trafficking count and to one year and one day for each possession and obtaining by fraud count. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the mandatory minimum sentencing term for trafficking in oxycodone violated the Eighth Amendment and former Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;17 (1997). The appellate court held that the mandatory minimum sentences were not grossly disproportionate to the trafficking crime. The Florida legislature could reasonably decide that trafficking in oxycodone warranted a significant term of imprisonment, even in the absence of a prior offense or violent behavior. The amount of oxycodone possessed by defendant fell into the highest weight category under &sect; 893.135(1)(c)(1), Fla. Stat. (Supp. 1996). Defendant did not possess such an extraordinarily small amount of oxycodone that his crime should not be considered severe. The sentence also was constitutional under former Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 (1997). Although the substantial majority by weight of each prescription was composed of acetaminophen, under &sect;&nbsp;893.135(1)(c)(1), Fla. Stat. (Supp. 1996), an individual could be convicted for possessing &quot;any mixture&quot; containing oxycodone that weighed at least four grams. Finally, the executive branch had the power to consider the mitigating factors and to grant pardons and commute sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant organizations sued appellees, a citizen group and state and local agencies and officials, seeking a declaration that a &quot;slots initiative&quot; petition proposing to amend the Florida Constitution was invalid because it did not comply with Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3 or &sect; 100.371, Fla. Stat. After the election was held, the Circuit Court for Leon County, Florida, granted appellees summary judgment. The organizations appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organizations claimed paid petition gatherers forged signatures and fabricated names on initiative petitions, in violation of Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3, and the names and addresses of the paid petition gatherers were not included, in violation of &sect; 100.371, Fla. Stat. The trial court held the election cured any failure by appellees to obtain the constitutionally required number of petition signatures, even if they and their agents committed fraud. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that Florida law did not mandate the invalidation of signature petition forms that did not include the name and address of the paid petition gatherers. However, the trial court erred in ruling that it was precluded by the separation of powers doctrine from reviewing the method used by the supervisors of elections to verify signatures. Summary judgment was entered in error on the claim that the petition did not comply with Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3, as the suit was filed before the election, and an election could cure only minor, technical defects in the form of the submission of a proposed amendment -- not fraud. The trial court erred in denying the organizations an expedited trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the summary judgment to the extent it was entered on separation of powers grounds and on the organizations' claim that the petitions did not comply with Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3. It remanded the case for a trial to determine whether appellees failed to obtain the constitutionally required signatures. If the trial court determined they did, and no remaining defenses applied, it had to declare the initiative invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant cities sued appellee county, challenging an amendment to the county's charter that intended to provide an exclusive method of voluntary municipal annexation for the county. The Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County, Florida, ruled the amendment was partially valid but contained three invalid provisions. All parties appealed. Appellants moved for rehearing, rehearing en banc, and for clarification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that portions of the amendment violated &sect; 171.044(4), Fla. Stat. (2004), as the exclusive method of voluntary annexation had to be contained in the charter itself, while the amendment allowed the use of an ordinance to accomplish that goal. It held that the other challenged provisions were valid and upheld the amendment by severing the invalid portions. The appellate court held that &sect; 171.044(4) authorized a county to devise its own methods of voluntary municipal annexation, as long as it was consistent with the Florida Constitution, general law, and special law. Under &sect; 171.044(4), where a county's charter contained an exclusive method of municipal annexation, &sect; 171.044's procedures did not apply; the procedures of the charter had to be followed. The trial court properly removed those portions of the amendment allowing annexation to be accomplished through an ordinance rather than the charter itself, because those provisions violated &sect; 171.044(4), the remaining provisions were valid, and the amendment had a severability clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) that denied his motion to declare &sect; 828.122(3), Fla. Stat. (2005), which outlawed animal fighting, unconstitutional as overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant admitted to investigators that he had gone to the location to watch cockfights, he was charged with violating &sect; 828.122(3). The State specifically alleged that defendant was present at a cockfight, and possessed spurs, which the roosters wore in order to fight, thus, promoting cockfighting. Defendant argued that the statute was overbroad because it might punish innocent bystanders who happened upon two animals fighting, e.g., a person who observed two dogs fighting in the street or a zoo patron who witnessed animals fighting. The appellate court found that the language of the statute was clear and unambiguous, particularly when considered with the requirement that such attendance be &quot;knowing.&quot; Because the statute was not overly broad or vague, the rule of lenity did not apply. Consequently, the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
