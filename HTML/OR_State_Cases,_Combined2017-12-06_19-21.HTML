Rev. Stat. &sect; 107.105(1)(f)(E) would not, they did not lead to the same estate recovery as the elective share statutes in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 114.600 to 114.725, and allowed a recovery where those statutes did not, let the department recover for transfers without adequate consideration where Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court found that officers' conduct in ordering defendant to step out of her home was a show of authority that significantly intruded on her liberty and amounted to a seizure. The subsequent order to remain on the porch while one officer questioned her immediately followed the order to step out of the house. That second order continued the initial intrusion by restraining defendant from being free to reenter her home. That show of authority, too, was a sufficient intrusion on defendant's liberty to constitute a seizure for purposes of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. However, the seizure of defendant was reasonable because officers believed that defendant's husband had just assaulted her. The officers acted reasonably in temporarily detaining defendant for purposes of questioning her as a witness to and victim of a recent or ongoing assault. The officers had an objectively reasonable basis to obtain and verify defendant's identity and an objectively reasonable belief that defendant could provide information material to the assault. The trial court therefore correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence discovered in the subsequent consensual search of defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the legislature had the authority to vary and modify both the form and the measure of recovery for an injury, so long as plaintiff was not left with less than a substantial remedy.

Plaintiffs alleged that the teacher engaged in a grooming process that included gaining the support of their families so that they would counsel their sons to respect the teacher's authority and comply with his instructions and requests. Plaintiffs alleged that, as a result, they had such admiration and respect for the teacher, and the wrongful touching in which the teacher engaged was so similar to the non-tortious touching that they had experienced during the grooming process that, as young boys, they were confused by the teacher's conduct and unable to discern that the touching was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayers said the gain was not &quot;business income&quot; under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 314.610(1) (1999) and not subject to allocation under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 314.280 (1999). The supreme court held the department reasonably interpreted business income definitions in Or. Admin. R. 150-314.280-(B) (1999) because, by interpreting the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 314.605 to 314.675 (1999), definition of business income in the Rule consistently with a California Supreme Court decision, the department gave effect to both definitions of business income in the Rule. The department was properly granted summary judgment because, so construed, both definitions of business income were broad enough to reach the gain from the sale of the corporate assets. The court's interpretation of Or. Admin. R. 150-314.280-(B) (1999) was consistent with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 314.280 (1999) because (1) the statute's wording was broad enough to reach the department's reading of the Rule, allowing the department to apportion income derived from property used in the taxpayer's unitary business, and (2) nothing in the statute barred apportioning gain from assets sold in liquidation.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that remand was appropriate for reconsideration of defendant two's waiver of a jury trial; the trial court erred because it withheld its consent to defendant two's jury trial waiver based solely on the prosecutor's perceived objection -- a position that was not based on considerations of speed, economy, or the protection of defendant two's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner on review taxpayer challenged a decision from the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which affirmed the circuit court's dismissal, based on lack of standing, of the taxpayer's suit for declaratory and injunctive relief alleging that respondent on review, a school district and its board of directors, lacked authority to issue certain obligations to finance improvements to district property without voter approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The district issued the obligations pursuant to a board resolution. The taxpayer alleged in his complaint that he had standing as a taxpayer and voter because the issuance of the obligations increased the likelihood that the district would seek additional funds from taxpayers and because he had been deprived of the right to vote on their issuance. He did not ask for a declaration that the obligations were invalid, nor did he request an order compelling the district to hold an election. Rather, he sought an order declaring that the district should have held an election and requiring the district to default on the obligations. The court held that the taxpayer lacked standing under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28.020 to seek relief under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. As to voter standing, although denial of the right to vote could satisfy the personal injury requirement for standing, the requested declaration would have no practical effect on voting rights and would amount to a purely advisory opinion. As to taxpayer standing, the possibility of higher taxes was predicated on a series of hypothetical contingencies. The same analysis also applied to the claim for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court of Oregon articulated and applied a clarified test for exploitation, disavowing the minimal factual nexus part of the Hall test, and held that suppression was not required under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. Defendant's consent to search his pockets was not the product of the unlawful stop because defendant consented in order to ease the mind of the officer, who was concerned because defendant had his hands in his pockets, which were bulky, and had weapons in his vehicle, and it was very dark at the location. Drug evidence from a search of a tin found in defendant's pocket was not tainted by the unlawful stop because the search of defendant's pocket was valid and there was no indication that the officer exploited the stop to gain defendant's consent to open the tin. Defendant's voluntary consent to search his house following his arrest was valid because evidence from the prior two searches gave the officer probable cause to arrest defendant, and defendant was given Miranda warnings before the officer requested consent.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 676.210 that the legislature's purpose in enacting that statute was to grant courts statutory power to enter injunctions, not to deprive them of their inherent judicial power to enter stays. Section 676.210 made a board's order suspending or revoking a health care practitioner's license immediately effective and granted a court authority to enforce it, but also permitted a board and a court acting pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act to stay an order of suspension or revocation of license pending appeal. The board went astray when it argued, and the court of appeals erred in deciding, that &sect; 676.210 deprived the Court of Appeals of authority to issue a stay pending its decision on the merits of the therapist's appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In a securities fraud action brought by plaintiff buyer, the State of Oregon, the Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed a trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant seller, finding that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 59.135 and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 59.137 required proof of reliance on misrepresentations and rejecting the buyer's fraud on the market claim. The buyer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State purchased more than $ 15 million of common stock in the seller in the open market on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 2003 and 2004. The State alleged that the seller's shares were traded on an efficient securities market, that the price of the shares reflected the material information that the seller disclosed to the market, and that the price of the shares was artificially inflated because of misrepresentations made by the seller, including false representations that the seller had complied with a strict ethical code of conduct and concealing the fact that the seller's reported financial results were achieved through unethical and illegal business practices. The court held that the State was required to establish reliance as an element of its fraud claim. The fraud on the market theory was applicable in Oregon because the U.S. Supreme Court case adopting that theory was decided in 1988, and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 59.137 was enacted in 2003. Consequently, by the time Oregon enacted Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 59.137, the fraud-on-the-market doctrine had been part of the federal law landscape for 15 years.</SPAN></P>

The court held that although several changes were made to facilitate permitting the death penalty, those changes were closely related, so that the measure did not violate the separate vote requirement. The court held, however, that the trial court erred in empaneling an anonymous jury. The trial court adopted a procedure that expressly precluded defendant from learning the names and addresses of jurors. Although the trial court made an effort to explain that there was a non-prejudicial reason for the deviation from the norm, that they were being permitted to withhold information to protect their anonymity from the public and the press, it also told eight of the 12 jurors that it would furnish their names, not to &quot;the parties,&quot; but to &quot;the attorneys,&quot; implying that defendant was dangerous.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff voters sought review of a decision of the Oregon Court of Appeals affirming a trial court's decision denying declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the State to enforce Or. Ballot Measure 47 (2006), Or. Rev. Stat. ch. 259, which required creation of new campaign finance statutes to implement Or. Ballot Measure 46, which was simultaneously rejected when Measure 47 was approved by Oregon voters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Measure 46 (2006) sought to amend the Oregon Constitution to permit the enactment of laws prohibiting or limiting electoral campaign contributions and expenditures. Measure 47 (2006) sought to create new campaign finance statutes that would implement Measure 46. The State took the position that Measure 47 was unenforceable because Measure 46 was defeated. Intervenors asserted that Measure 47 was unconstitutional. The supreme court concluded that Measure 47 was enforceable because &sect; 9(f) required Measure 47 to be codified and held in abeyance pending an appropriate constitutional amendment or judicial decision that would render it operative. In addition, &sect; 9(f) did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 because it's taking effect did not depend on any authority. Finally, the supreme court ruled that it could not rule on the constitutionality of Measure 47 because plaintiffs neglected to allege a justiciable controversy under the declaratory judgment act as to the individual provisions of Measure 47.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued that the trial court had no statutory authority to impose the &quot;no contact&quot; condition as it related to his father, because that condition did not relate to the only permissible purpose for a condition of release under Or.

The supreme court noted that defendant asserted at oral argument that the trial court had erred, because there was no evidence in the record to support the conclusion that the &quot;no contact&quot; condition was necessary. Defendant conceded that such a condition was permissible in some circumstances and shifted his focus to whether the evidence in the record supported the trial court's imposition of the condition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff filed a petition under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.866, alleging knowing and repeated unwanted sexual contact by defendant, and seeking both a stalking protective order and a judgment for compensatory money damages. The trial court conducted the trial without a jury and found for plaintiff, including an award of $42,347 in compensatory damages. The court of appeals affirmed, and defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Supreme Court of Oregon held that held that in an action under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.866 in which a plaintiff sought both a stalking protective order and a judgment for compensatory money damages, the parties were entitled to a jury trial on the claim for money damages. Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, and Or. Const. art. VII (Amended) &sect; 3, did not guarantee a right to jury trial for claims or request for relief that, standing alone, were equitable in nature and would have been tried to a court without a jury at common law. By the same token, those provisions did guarantee a right to jury trial on claims or requests that were properly categorized as &quot;civil&quot; or &quot;at law,&quot; in the absence of a showing that the nature of a claim or request for relief was such that it would have been tried to a court without a jury. Plaintiff's claim seeking monetary damage for injury inflicted was properly categorized as civil or at law, even if it did not have a precise historical analog. The Court of Appeals erred in reaching a contrary conclusion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed decision of the court of appeals with regard to the right to jury trial on the claim for compensatory damages and reversed the circuit court's judgment as to compensatory damages. The court otherwise affirmed the judgment. The case was remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of violating Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 475.856, 475.906, and 163.575(1)(b).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant renewed his argument that he had insufficient authority over either the teenagers or the home to have permitted the teenagers to enter or remain there. In his view, a person may not permit what that person lacks the authority to prohibit. The state argued for a broader meaning of permit. The illegal conduct was the act of permitting a  minor to enter or remain where illegal drug activity was occurring. Section 163.575(1)(b) did not require a person to have legal authority over a minor or over the place where drug activity was occurring. In the present case, the state had to demonstrate that defendant engaged in some affirmative conduct authorizing or otherwise making it possible for the minors to enter or remain in the home. The evidence missed that mark. Its emphasis on his role in maintaining an illegal drug operation in a place where he knew that minors would remain therefore did not advance its case. Its emphasis on his role in maintaining an illegal drug operation in a place where he knew that minors would remain did not advance its case in the absence of actual authority.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the error was not harmless because the recorded conversation was the only evidence that corroborated the accomplice's assertion that defendants were the primary actors in the burglary and therefore went to a key element of the State's case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A jury awarded an estate $79.5 million in punitive damages for defendant tobacco company's fraud and negligence leading to a smoker's lung cancer death. The manufacturer refused to pay plaintiff, the State of Oregon, the 60 percent of punitive damages due under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31.735. The trial court ruled that the state had released its claim, and the Court of Appeals, Oregon, certified the appeal to the Oregon Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Oregon Supreme Court held that the state's right to a share of punitive damages under Oregon's split recovery statute was not a &quot;released claim,&quot; as that term was defined in the master settlement agreement in multi-state tobacco litigation. Therefore, the state did not release its right to pursue payment of its statutory interest in 60 percent of the punitive damages award when it settled that other action. The state released only those claims that were directly or indirectly based on the tobacco company's described tobacco-related conduct, but the state's interest in the 60 percent share arose by operation of law. A claim to collect on the judgment would be to enforce the statute, not to recover damages for tobacco-related conduct. The fact that there was a but-for causal connection between the current case and the state's entitlement to part of the punitive damages award did not change the legal nature of the state's interest in its share of the award. The state's interest in the punitive damages award arose out of a statute that was indifferent to the factual basis of the underlying litigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for entry of a judgment. The court also reversed a post-judgment order in the multi-state tobacco litigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In two consolidated cases, appellant the Public Employees Retirement Board (PERB) challenged summary judgment granted by the Circuit Court for Multnomah County, Oregon, in appellee retirees' suit to prevent the recovery of overpayments of benefits to the retirees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After determining that a certain class of retirees had received overpayments of the benefits to which they were entitled, the PERB established a general method for the recover of overpayments made to those retirees. The retirees filed suit challenging the PERB's order adopting repayment methods, and the circuit court granted summary judgment in their favor. On review, the court held that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the retirees and denying the PERB's cross-motion for summary judgment because the PERB correctly applied Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 238.715 to recoup the overpayments made to the retirees, as Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 238.715 provided explicit authority to the PERB to recover overpayments. Further, categorically treating the erroneous overpayments to all of the retirees at issue as an administrative expense violated well-established trust fund principles that are embedded in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;  238.660 because that treatment favors the retirees over other beneficiaries of the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Multnomah County Circuit Court, Oregon, granted petitioner father's motion in limine to exclude evidence that respondent driver was intoxicated at the time of the collision. Respondent trucking company was found to be 22 percent at fault and the driver 78 percent at fault. The Oregon Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the trial court erred in excluding the evidence of the driver's intoxication. The father petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court noted that the company did not proffer evidence that showed that, because the driver was intoxicated, she inevitably would have killed decedent, even if his pickup had not been stationary. Because the fact of the driver's intoxication would not have made her conduct more significant or the company's conduct less significant in the causation analysis, it was not relevant to that issue. The company did not allege in its cross-claim that it had paid more than its proportional share of liability or sought a money judgment against the driver. It should have included those allegations in its answer as an affirmative defense. The cross-claim that the company proffered fulfilled the function of an affirmative defense, Or. R. Civ. P. 19. The defect in designating the pleading as a cross-claim rather than an affirmative defense did not affect the father's substantial rights. However, the evidence of the driver's intoxication was not relevant on the issues of causation, liability, or damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was reversed and remanded to the circuit court for a new trial limited to the degree of fault of each defendant expressed as a percentage of the total fault attributable to each defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The prosecution sought review of an order from the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which denied reconsideration after determining that it had jurisdiction under Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant failed to complete a diversion program. The trial court imposed a sentence within the statutory range set forth in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 161.635(1)(a), 813.010(6)(a). When defendant asked why the trial court had imposed more than the mandatory minimum fine, the trial court explained that the additional amount was for defendant's no contest plea at the time of entering the diversion. Defendant contended on appeal that although the fine imposed was within the statutory range, he had been unconstitutionally penalized for exercising his right to plead no contest. The court held that the asserted due process violation did not cause the sentence to exceed the maximum allowable by law. The reference in &sect; 138.050(1)(a) to a disposition exceeding the maximum allowable by law meant a disposition that exceeded a maximum sentence expressed by means of legislation, not a disposition that violated the Oregon or federal Constitution. Thus, because the amount of defendant's fine was less than the statutory maximum that could have been imposed for the offense, the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction under &sect; 138.050(1)(a), and defendant's proper remedy was to seek post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Umatilla County Circuit Court, Oregon, imposed an enhanced sentence based on nonenumerated aggravating factors. The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed. Defendant petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>

He argued that this violated the separation provision of the Oregon Constitution, Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. The supreme court found that not only did a presumptive sentence not define the outer boundaries of the trial court's sentencing authority, but the sentencing guidelines expressly authorized trial courts to decide whether nonenumerated aggravating and mitigating factors warranted imposing a greater or a lesser sentence than a presumptive sentence. In imposing a departure sentence based on nonenumerating aggravating factors, a trial court was not acting beyond the bounds of its sentencing authority. The discretion that the sentencing guidelines gave prosecutors to identify and courts to determine nonenumerated aggravating factors was neither standardless nor unfettered. That aspect of the sentencing guidelines was not vague in violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 20 and 21. Prior cases provided sufficient guidance to prosecutors in identifying those aggravating factors that would support the imposition of an enhanced sentence under U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that evidence that, in 1994, he aided and assisted in the murder of one person and personally attempted to murder another was relevant to the jury's determination of his future dangerousness under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.150(1)(b). Evidence regarding his interest in satanism and death metal music was relevant under Or. Evid. Code 401 to the issues in the penalty phase of the trial. A reasonable juror could have found that his interest in those subjects provided one of the motives for the crimes committed during the convenience store robbery. The trial court admitted the evidence regarding his interest in those subjects because it bore on his motive for the convenience store crimes, without regard to the specific nature of the motive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In 2004, the state resubmitted 1996 charges of sexual assault to a second grand jury, along with additional counts of sexual assault of a second victim. A jury of the Multnomah County Circuit Court, Oregon, found defendant guilty of the resulting four counts. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction without an opinion. Defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Oregon Supreme Court found no error in the resubmission of the 1996 charge to the grand jury. Under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 132.430(2), a trial court properly considered whether resubmission would be in the interest of justice, guided by factors such as whether resubmission would be an abuse of the grand jury process or would serve the public interest in bringing a criminal to justice. In the current case, the prosecutor's affidavit established that the state had additional evidence against defendant that had not been available when the first grand jury declined to indict. There was also no due process violation. To demonstrate that preindictment delay violated the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause, a defendant had to show that the delay actually prejudiced the defendant and that the government culpably caused the delay. A court had to weigh the government's reason for the delay against the prejudice to determine whether the delay violated fundamental conceptions of justice, fair play, and decency. In the current case, defendant showed either no actual prejudice, or only the slightest actual prejudice, which was insufficient in light of the lack of government culpability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals of Oregon that affirmed his convictions of first-degree sexual abuse under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.427 and attempted unlawful sexual penetration under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 161.405(2)(b) and 163.411, arguing that the appellate court erred in finding that he waived his objection to the use of anonymous jurors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with sex crimes following sexual contact with a 10-year-old girl. At trial, the trial court ruled that the names and other personal information of prospective jurors would not be disclosed. A jury was selected and empanelled, and the jury found defendant guilty. Although defendant objected to the use of anonymous jurors at the time of jury selection, the appellate court held that he waived his objection. In deciding an issue of first impression, the court held that, under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10.205(2), trial courts had the authority to require that a jury be seated without disclosing the names, addresses, and employers of prospective jurors to the parties. However, the trial court's authority to empanel an anonymous jury was to be exercised consistent with defendant's constitutional rights. Because Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, permitted an anonymous jury only when the trial court found that the circumstances of a particular case justified that practice and took steps to mitigate any prejudice to defendant and because the trial court failed to make the requisite findings or take any steps to prevent prejudice to defendant, the trial court committed reversible error.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals, Oregon, reduced the punitive damages award, finding that it was grossly excessive under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Court of Appeals primarily relied on the ratio between punitive and compensatory damages in concluding that the award of punitive damages was grossly excessive. On further review, the court held that when a compensatory damages award is small and does not already serve an admonitory function, the ratio between punitive and compensatory damages is of limited assistance in determining whether the amount of a jury's punitive damages award meets or exceeds state goals of deterrence and retribution. Having decided that the punitive damages award in the current case could exceed a single-digit multiplier of the compensatory damages award without violating due process, the court found that punitive damages actually awarded--$175,000--was not, nevertheless, grossly excessive. The compensatory damages were small and the ratio between the punitive and compensatory damages--22:1--was in the low double digits. That ratio was not so high that it made the award grossly excessive. The amount was not so high that the court could say that it exceeded, rather than served, Oregon's interests in deterring and punishing a violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 659A.043.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court held that there was no Sixth or Fourteenth Amendment error in excusing sua sponte two prospective jurors who lacked proficiency in the English language and who needed an interpreter. The interests articulated by the state--the jurors' ability to follow the proceedings and participate in deliberations and the cost of providing interpreters--were sufficient to justify excluding non-English-speaking persons from the jury pool. The court also held that there was no error in excluding a government witness's statement to defendant--&quot;How do you like me now?&quot;--as he was leaving the stand because a detailed cross-examination of the witness and other evidence adduced at trial showed the witness's dislike of defendant. Finally, the death sentence did not have to be imposed consecutively to the life sentence that defendant was already serving. Because Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.123(3), requiring consecutive sentences for crimes in prison, conflicted with the death penalty statutes, the court relied on the particular legislative intent expressed in Or. Rev.

The developer's allegation that the city required it to construct off-site improvements at a cost that was not roughly proportional to the impact of the development did not allege a taking that would give rise to a claim for just compensation. The city's failure to satisfy the landowner consent requirements of Or. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Oregon Court of Appeals vacated the 420-month sentence that the Polk County Circuit Court had imposed on defendant in a sex abuse case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State argued that the rule that when a defendant was retried after a successful appeal of his or her conviction, the court in the second proceeding may not impose a harsher sentence than had been imposed in the original proceeding, did not apply, or had to be abandoned. The supreme court agreed with the court of appeals in that nothing about Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.222(5)(a) suggested that the statute was specifically directed at the holding in Turner. The supreme court found that whatever the possibility of vindictive sentencing, the legislature remained competent to deal with it explicitly and, if it did not do so, both the state and federal constitutions provided the appropriate legal backstop. State v. Turner, 247 Ore. 301, 313, 429 P2d 197 (1967) was overruled. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.020 did not support the idea that the legislature intended to grant to trial judges the authority to use their sentencing power to impose more lengthy sentences on remand for the purpose of punishing defendants for bringing appeals. The trial court could impose a harsher sentence after retrial or remand, as long as its grounds for doing so were not directed at punishing the defendant for appealing.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 260.402 for making campaign contributions in the name of persons other than the contributor. Defendants demurred to the indictment, claimed the statute violated free speech under Or.

Prohibiting the concealment of the identity of the true provider of a political contribution was a modern variant of the principle underlying the historic legal prohibition against deceptive or misleading expression. Because Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 260.402 fell within a historical exception, the statute did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 260.402 gave adequate notice that it was unlawful to make a contribution using another person's name; therefore, defendants' vagueness challenge was rejected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">An Oregon trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents, Oregon Government Ethics Commission and the State of Oregon (state) on petitioner voters' claim for declaratory and injunctive relief based on challenges to statutory restrictions on the solicitation, offering, and receipt of gifts and entertainment by public officials and private persons. The supreme court reversed in part. The voters sought costs and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The voters argued that they should be awarded attorney fees based on the supreme court's power in equity, a so-called Deras award. The supreme court agreed with the parties that this was a proceeding in equity and that the first Deras requirement was satisfied. Although the voters succeeded in only one of their challenges to the gift and entertainment restriction statutes, the supreme court's opinion reversed the trial court judgment and held that the voters were entitled to a declaratory judgment that the restrictions on offering gifts and entertainment violated their free expression right under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The voters obtained a substantial modification of the judgment regardless of whether the public officials involved ultimately could accept the offers made. The supreme court designated the voters as the prevailing party. Although the voters established the right to offer gifts and free entertainment to public officials, the supreme court simultaneously upheld the statute prohibiting public officials from accepting them. The net result was not such a significant public benefit that the public at large should pay the voters' attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals of Oregon interpreted Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner was convicted of sexual abuse and other crimes. He sought post-conviction relief under the Oregon Post-Conviction Hearing Act, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.510 to 138.680, alleging the ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Using a standardized three-paragraph form, the post-conviction court issued its judgment denying relief. The form indicated that the denial was based on: &quot;failure of proof.&quot; Petitioner sent a letter, objecting that the judgment did not clearly state the grounds on which the case was determined. The Court of Appeals of Oregon erred by interpreting Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.640(1) to require that a post-conviction court provide an explanation sufficient to enable the appellate court to determine whether the post-conviction court committed a legal error that affected the result. The Supreme Court of Oregon found that the judgment did not clearly state the legal basis for the court's denial of each claim for relief. The judgment did not indicate whether petitioner failed to prove counsel's inadequacy or that he was prejudiced by counsel's performance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Both defendants were detained for traffic stops. The officers extended the traffic stop beyond a reasonable time by asking defendants about the contents of their vehicles instead of issuing a traffic citation. Each defendant was unlawfully seized in violation of Or. Const. art.

After the police found drugs either during a consensual vehicle search or a consensual pat-down search, defendants were charged with controlled substances offenses. Because there were no intervening circumstances or other circumstances mitigating the effect of the illegal seizures of each defendant, the Supreme Court of Oregon concluded that each defendant's consent was the product of police conduct that violated Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs brought an action for declaratory relief, asserting that Or. Rev.

I, &sect;&sect; 8 and 26, and the First Amendment and were unenforceable. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant State.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The instant court concluded that the trial court correctly granted summary judgment to the State on plaintiffs' challenges to the receipt of gifts and payment of expenses for entertainment restrictions under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and 26, and the First Amendment. Restrictions on public officials receiving gifts withstood constitutional challenge because giving gifts to public officials was nonexpressive conduct. The fact that gifts could be helpful in creating goodwill with public officials did not mean that Or. Const. art. &sect; I, &sect; 26, protected the delivery of gifts to them. The trial court also correctly granted summary judgment to the State on plaintiffs' challenges to the solicitation of gifts restrictions because plaintiffs did not qualify as persons affected by those restrictions. However, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the State regarding plaintiffs' challenges to the restrictions on offering gifts and entertainment under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Such restrictions impermissibly restricted the right of free expression. Plaintiffs were entitled to a declaratory judgment that the restrictions on offering gifts violated their right to free speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In cases consolidated for appeal, two defendants were convicted of first-degree sexual abuse under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.427(1)(a)(A). The trial courts held that the mandatory sentences required under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.700(2)(a)(P) violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, and imposed lesser sentences. The Court of Appeals of Oregon affirmed the convictions, but held that the trial courts should have imposed the maximum sentences. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">One defendant's conviction was affirmed where the testimony supported the jury's conclusion that she had acted with a sexual purpose in holding the back of the victim's head against her clothed breasts, while massaging the sides of his head. Although the touching itself did not necessarily demonstrate a sexual purpose, the record disclosed a litany of improper communications and conduct between defendant and the boy. The other defendant's conviction was also affirmed where defendant's comments and thoughts were sufficient to permit the factfinder to infer that he had acted with a sexual purpose when he briefly touched a girl. However, the statutorily prescribed penalty under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.700(2)(a)(P) was so disproportionate to the offenses committed by these defendants that it shocked the moral sense of reasonable people. Thus, the required 75-month sentence would have violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. Although the required sentence was adopted by the people, acting through the initiative process, and facial challenges had been rejected, its application in these particular cases was unconstitutional. Thus, the trial courts correctly imposed lesser sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The lower court's decisions were affirmed as to the conclusion that sufficient evidence supported defendants' convictions, but were reversed as to the conclusion that the trial courts should have imposed the mandatory sentences. The judgments of conviction and the sentences imposed by the trial courts were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In a lawyer disciplinary proceeding, the Oregon State Bar alleged causes of complaint, charging the accused attorney with violating provisions of the Oregon Code of Professional Responsibility Disciplinary Rules and the Oregon Rules of Professional Conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The causes of the complaint arose out of the attorney's handling of an estate matter, an employment matter, and complaints that were filed with the Bar around the time of the attorney's suspension. The supreme court found that the accused violated Or. Code Prof. Resp. DR 1-102(A)(4), Or. Code Prof. Resp. DR 2-106(A), Or. Code Prof. Resp. EC 1.16(a)(1) and (d), Or. Code Prof. Resp. EC  3.3(a)(1), Or. Code Prof. Resp. EC 5.5, Or. Code Prof. Resp. EC 8.1(a)(2), and Or. Code Prof. Resp. EC 8.4(a)(3) and (4). With respect to the estate matter, the supreme court found that the attorney was passive and waited for others to take the initiative. The attorney often delayed, frustrated, and even actively interfered with efforts to settle and resolve claims. As to the attorney's representation of clients around the time of the attorney's suspension, the attorney falsely represented in his several motions to abate and postpone that his disciplinary matter was on appeal. The trial panel determined that the attorney violated several duties in an intentional or knowing manner. There were also several aggravating factors with only one potential mitigating factor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff, a class of state employees, brought an action against defendant State in 1997 seeking unpaid overtime compensation. The trial court entered judgment for the employees. On an earlier appeal, the court ordered a recalculation of the employees' awards. The trial court recalculated the awards and denied post-judgment interest. The employees appealed, and the Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed. The employees again appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The employees argued that they were entitled to post-judgment interest on their awards dating from the trial court's original judgment in their favor. The State argued that it was immune from the payment of post-judgment interest. The court held that the State was not immune. When the State submitted to liability for unpaid wages under former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 279.340(1) (1995), renumbered as Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 653.268(1) (2003), and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 652.200 (1995), it was responsible for attendant money awards, including attorney fees and costs, which were not distinct claims for damages. The court saw no reason to distinguish between the State's liability for attorney fees and costs and the State's liability for post-judgment interest under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 82.010(2)(a). The court held that the supplemental judgments that the trial court eventually entered in accordance with the order to recalculate the awards constituted a modification of the original judgment and did not constitute a full reversal, wiping out the original judgment. Therefore, the post-judgment interest accrued from the date of the original judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The residents challenged the Governor's authority to enter into a gaming compact with certain Indian Tribes. Under the compact, the Tribes would be permitted to open a casino near the residents' town. The supreme court first addressed whether Or. R. Civ. P. 29 A applied to mandamus proceedings. The circuit court erred in concluding that Rule 29 A required that the residents join the Tribes in the mandamus action. The supreme court next concluded that a declaratory judgment action did not provide a plain, speedy and adequate remedy because under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28.110, the Tribes would be required to participate in any declaratory judgment action. If the Tribes chose not to participate by invoking sovereign immunity, a court would be entirely without authority to decide the case. Moreover, because the Tribes control its availability, a declaratory judgment action would not afford the residents any relief. In this case, however, a declaratory judgment action was neither a plain nor adequate alternative to a mandamus proceeding for compelling the Governor to perform his official duty with regard to the gaming compact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">As a result of drought conditions, the Federal Bureau of Reclamation terminated delivery of water to the farmers in order to make water available for endangered fish. Claiming a property right in the water, the farmers brought an action in the federal claims court alleging that the U.S. had unconstitutionally taken their property. Relying on an Oregon statute, the claims court ruled that the farmers had no equitable right in the water that they used to irrigate their land and that the farmers' takings claim based on the existence of an equitable interest in the water necessarily failed. The farmers appealed to the circuit court, which certified three state law questions. All three questions presented issues of state law that were both preliminary to and potentially dispositive of the farmers' takings claim. The court determined that certification was proper under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28.200 because an appropriate federal court certified the questions, the questions were legal, the questions presented issues of state law, the answers could resolve the federal claim, and the circuit court concluded that there was no controlling Oregon precedent.</SPAN></P>

The instant court concluded that Or. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, directed the legislature to provide funding sufficient for the public schools to meet quality goals established by law. The trial court should have entered a declaratory judgment on the limited ground that the legislature failed to fund the public school system at the level specified in Or. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 8. However, the instant court also concluded that plaintiffs were not entitled to a broader declaratory judgment that would require the legislature to fund the public school system in each biennium at the levels required by Or. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 8, as well as an injunction requiring the legislature to fund the public school system at those levels.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted on two counts of harassment in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.065(1)(a)(B). The Court of Appeals (Oregon) concluded on defendant's appeal that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.065(1)(a)(B) was constitutional both on its face and as applied, and affirmed defendant's convictions. The court allowed defendant's petition for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Even speech that was intended and likely to produce violence could not be criminalized unless the violence was imminent. A harassment statute that lacked that limitation swept too much protected speech within its reach to survive a facial challenge. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.065(1)(a)(B) focused on effects that the legislature wished to forbid, harassment or annoyance of another person. Defendant's expression may have been offensive, but the State could not suppress all speech that offended with the club of the criminal law. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.065(1)(a)(B) criminalized a harm that resulted only from a kind of expression, public insults through abusive words or gestures. The harm that the statute sought to prevent, harassment or annoyance, generally was one against which the Oregon Constitution did not permit the criminal law to shield individuals when that harm was caused by another's speech. For that reason, the prohibition contained in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.065(1)(a)(B) was overbroad on its face and violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner, a mother who was the conservator for her minor child, brought a medical negligence complaint against respondent physician and respondent medical center. The trial court dismissed the matter on the ground that the action was barred by the five-year limitation period established in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12.110(4). The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The complaint alleged that the physician and the hospital negligently caused injuries to the child while the mother was in labor. Among other things, the mother alleged that the physician and the hospital failed to recognize the signs of fetal distress, and they delayed in performing a caesarean-section delivery. At two and three months after the child's birth, a neurologist informed the mother that the child was developing normally. Later, the same neurologist diagnosed the child with mixed developmental disorder, developmental speech, or language disorder. On appeal, the mother argued that application of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12.110(4) violated the remedy requirement set forth in Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The supreme court disagreed with the mother's argument that legislature had abolished a pre-statehood common-law right. The pre-statehood disability law did not protect the mother from the five-year limitation period in &sect; 12.110(4). The remedy clause set forth in Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 did not prevent legislative enactment of a statute that modified the disability protection that minors enjoyed before 1859.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">From a land use case, petitioner Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD) sought review of a prior decision decided under Ballot Measure 37. The DLCD subsequently contended that the Ballot Measure 49 rendered the prior decision moot and requested that its petition seeking review be rendered moot and the prior decision be vacated. Respondent landowner parties in the prior decision denied that that decision was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On review, the DLCD contended that Measure 49 (codified at Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.305) extinguished all claims and orders under Measure 37 (codified at Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.352 (2005)). The supreme court agreed that the prior decision was moot as Measure 49 rendered the waiver order at the center of the jurisdictional dispute wholly ineffective. As to the landowners' contention, the supreme court determined that Measure 49 provided them with an opportunity to assert their claim, and a forum in which they could assert it. Whether the Oregon Court of Appeals or the circuit court had jurisdiction to review the DLCD's final order respecting the landowners' 37 claim could have no practical effect upon the parties: if the order at issue had no continuing legal effect, then neither party could gain anything from review in either forum. Thus, the prior case was moot. Contrary to the landowners' argument, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14.175 did not present a basis for review because the landowners could pursue their claim pursuant to the procedure set out in Measure 49, including any assertion that Measure 49 acted on them in an unconstitutional way.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner decedent's mother sued respondent driver's insurer for wrongful death. A jury found for the mother and awarded punitive damages based on bad faith failure to settle her third party claim. The trial court reduced the compensatory damages award, but left the punitive damage award undisturbed. The Court of Appeals of Oregon reinstated the compensatory damage award, but significantly reduced the punitive damage award. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The insurer's arguments unrelated to punitive damages were not considered as review had been allowed review to consider a particular set of issues. Under relevant federal case law, three guideposts determined whether a punitive damage award violated the Due Process Clause: reprehensibility, the ratio between punitive damages and the actual or potential harm to the plaintiff, and the relationship between the punitive damage award and civil or criminal penalties for comparable conduct. The second guidepost, the ratio, provided a rough numerical baseline for calculating a maximum constitutionally permissible award in a given case. Case law and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 746.230 put the insurer was on notice that its refusal to settle the mother's claim against the driver within policy limits was not immune from punitive damages. Under the guideposts, the insurer's conduct was very reprehensible as it was directed at a financially vulnerable victim, was not confined to the victim, and involved intentional malice and deceit. However, the punitive damages was more than case law allowed as they were 16 times the potential harm. The maximum punitive damage award was four times the potential harm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The decision was affirmed as modified to reflect that the highest permissible punitive damage award was four times the amount of the mother's actual and potential harm. The trial court's judgment was vacated and remanded with instructions to grant the insurer's motion for a new trial, limited to punitive damages, unless the mother agreed to remittitur of punitive damages to four times the compensatory damages award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner personal representative challenged a judgment from the Oregon Court of Appeals, which affirmed a lower court's decision to cap the damages awarded in a wrongful death case filed against respondent medical providers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The jury entered an award of one million dollars in noneconomic damages in a wrongful death action. The trial court applied Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31.710 and reduced the award to $500,000. It also reduced the interest under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 82.010(2)(f). The court of appeals affirmed, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court determined that there was no violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because a wrongful death claim was not recognized at common law when this constitutional provision was adopted. Moreover, the common law of Oregon did not incorporate Lord Campbell's Act, 9 &amp; 10 Vict, ch 93 (1846) because it was enacted after the American Revolution. Therefore, the statutory damages cap in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31.701 did not abolish a remedy that was available at common law when Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 was drafted. Next, the right to a jury trial under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 could not have conferred a right to a jury award of a kind or amount that was contrary to statutory law. Finally, the lower interest rate in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 82.0101(2)(f) was applicable here because the term &quot;injuries&quot; contained therein referred to any violation of a legal right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted three times of felonies involving the use or threatened use of firearms. The trial court that sentenced defendant on the third felony refused to impose a 30-year minimum sentence pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.610(4)(c) (2001). The State appealed. The Court of Appeals, Oregon, reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the case to the trial court for imposition of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court of appeals held that defendant could not collaterally attack the first conviction. On review, defendant argued that the terms of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.610 (2001) did not permit imposition of a 30-year gun minimum sentence. The instant court found that defendant's third conviction met both of the requirements of &sect; 161.610(4)(c) because (1) the crime for which defendant was convicted was a felony, robbery in the first degree, which had as an element the use of a deadly weapon, with the indictment specifying a firearm as that weapon, and (2) it followed his imprisonment for 10 years pursuant to &sect; 161.610(4)(b). Thus, the trial court was required to impose a 30-year minimum sentence. The instant court declined to hold that defendant's first conviction was invalid because it could not say that the first conviction deprived defendant of his right to a jury trial, and defendant could not pursue, more than 20 years later, a collateral attack on his first conviction. Finally, regardless of the validity of the first conviction, the terms of &sect; 161.610(4)(c) required the imposition of a 30-year gun minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>

Because defendant had been previously convicted of two felony sex crimes, he was sentenced, under &sect; 137.719(1), to 18 terms of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Defendant appealed, arguing that his sentence was excessive because his sentence would have been only over 111 years had he not been previously convicted of sex crimes. The court disagreed, holding that defendant's sentences were not unconstitutional under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 because it could not say that the legislature was unreasonable in imposing such a severe penalty on a serial sex offender under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.719(1) and such a sentence did not shock the moral sense of reasonable people.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff patient sued defendant Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) and individuals who treated him, alleging negligence. Pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 30.265(1) and 30.270(1), OHSU was substituted as the sole defendant and judgment on the pleadings was entered against OHSU. The Court of Appeals of Oregon concluded that the substitution of OHSU for the individuals violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. OHSU and the individuals appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The primary issue was whether Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 30.265(1) and 30.270(1), as applied to facts of this case, violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. OHSU would have enjoyed sovereign immunity at common law where its function, powers, and governance structure indicated that it was an instrumentality of the state performing state functions. The Oregon Tort Claims Act's 1991 elimination of a cause of action against the individuals, combined with its limitation of damages, did not survive scrutiny under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, where, at the time Oregon adopted its remedy guarantee, the patient would have been entitled to seek and recover economic and noneconomic damages. The 1991 amendments to the statute eliminated that right by imposing capped remedies against the public body only. Although the legislature was authorized under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, to vary or modify the nature, form, or amount of recovery for a common-law remedy, it could not emasculate the common-law remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In 1988, defendant was convicted of aggravated murder in the Circuit Court of Douglas County, Oregon, and sentenced to death. The conviction was vacated and, on remand, defendant was again found guilty of aggravated murder and sentenced to death. The conviction was affirmed, but the sentence was vacated. Another death sentence was vacated in 1999 and, afterward, in 2002, defendant was again sentenced to death. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In the initial trial, the trial judge was disqualified on defendant's objection under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14.250 and 14.260. The same judge was assigned to preside over the 2002 penalty-phase proceedings. Neither party objected. Although Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14.250 and the 1987 disqualification order prevented the judge from further participation in the case, his conduct in presiding over the 2002 penalty-phase trial was a procedural error. Because defendant did not object when the judge presided over the 2002 penalty-phase proceeding, he did not preserve the issue for review. During the 2002 penalty-phase proceeding, the admission of transcripts of prior witness testimony under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.012(a)(b) and Or. Evid. Code 804(3)(a), did not violate defendant's rights to confrontation under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Defendant did not object to the State's introduction of the transcripts and thus did not preserve the issue for review. A State expert's testimony on rebuttal examination related to the second question in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.150(1)(b), often referred to as the &quot;future dangerousness question,&quot; and did not exceed the scope of proper rebuttal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.076, the trial court entered an order requiring defendant, who had been convicted of the felony offense of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer in a motor vehicle, to submit a blood or buccal sample as a condition of his probation. The Oregon Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's order. Defendant petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued that the requirement in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.076 that he provide a blood or buccal sample violated his state and federal constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The court concluded that the requirement in &sect; 137.076 that persons convicted of felonies provide a blood or buccal sample as a condition of probation does not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The statute does not necessarily deprive felony offenders of certain of their constitutional rights in general, or of their rights under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, in particular, by subjecting them to a specific form of search and seizure as a consequence of their convictions. The statute narrows the class of persons potentially subject to it by limiting its terms to felons and persons convicted of certain serious offenses. The court perceived no principled basis for declaring that blood and buccal samples are different in any constitutionally significant way from gathering or retaining a person's identity through fingerprints and photographs. The court also concluded that requiring convicted felons to submit a blood or buccal sample does not violate the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State charged defendant with attempted possession of a controlled substance. The trial court, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.235 and prior case law, allowed the State to introduce a laboratory report without calling a criminalist. Defendant was convicted of attempted possession of a controlled substance, and he appealed. The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant's petition for review was allowed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A police officer arrested defendant for driving under the influence of intoxicants and searched defendant. The officer discovered a kind of glass pipe used to smoke cocaine. A criminalist at the laboratory analyzed the pipe's contents and returned a written report stating that the pipe contained cocaine residue. At issue in this case was whether the admission of a laboratory report at defendant's criminal trial violated his right to meet the witnesses face to face under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, or his right to be confronted with the witnesses against him under the Sixth Amendment. The trial court's admission of the laboratory report, without requiring the state to produce at trial the criminalist who prepared the report or to demonstrate that the criminalist was unavailable to testify, violated defendant's right to confront the witness against him under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Prior case law had essentially equated the notice and subpoena concepts. The supreme court concluded the previously established subpoena requirement was erroneous. The supreme court did not need to reach the question of whether the admission of the laboratory report also violated the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs buyers sued defendant seller and argued that certain provisions in the parties' land sale contract violated the law, and the buyers' limited ability to prepay the contract was impermissible.

VII (Amended).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The seller argued that the Court of Appeals was not lawfully constituted under Or. Const. art. VII (Amended), because - in the seller's view - the provision of the Oregon Constitution that purported to authorize the legislature to establish courts was improperly adopted in 1910. It therefore followed that, when the legislature created the Court of Appeals by statute in 1969, it had no authority to do so. In particular, the seller alleged that without Art. VII (Amended) in place, the legislature had lacked the authority to create the Court of Appeals because Article VII (Original), which established the judicial power of the state, did not grant the legislature that authority. The instant court concluded that the irregularities, if any, in the adoption of Art. VII in 1910 had been cured by the implicit subsequent validation of that article by the people. Therefore that Art. VII was valid, and it followed that the creation of the Court of Appeals in 1969, pursuant to the authority granted by Art. VII , &sect; 1, was within the legislature's authority. The Court of Appeals had jurisdiction over the buyers' appeal in the present case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The inmate was convicted in 2000 of being a felon in possession of a firearm based on a conviction in 1995 of first-degree felony sexual penetration under Or.

On appeal of the appellate court's decision that the inmate was not entitled to such relief, the court affirmed. The court held that because at the time the inmate possessed the firearms, he had been convicted of a felony and no court had overturned or set aside that conviction, the inmate's conduct fell within the statutory definitions set out in &sect; 166.270. Section 166.270 did not make any provision for setting aside the inmate's convictions on the ground that the predicate felony conviction was later overturned. The court rejected the inmate's challenge to his convictions under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and the Standerfer case because the inmate's prior felony conviction was not a fact for the court to consider at sentencing but rather was an element of the crime for which he was convicted, and it was undisputed that he had the status of &quot;felon&quot; at the time he possessed the firearm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">An indictment alleged that defendant had committed a felony by delivering marijuana to a minor. At trial, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the indictment failed to allege all the elements of the charged offense. The trial court denied that motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued that, under former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.995(5) (1999), the indictment was deficient because it failed to allege that he was 18 years of age or older and that the victim was at least three years younger than he was. In denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal, the trial court reasoned that there was evidence from which a reasonable juror could find both those facts. When defendant objected that he was challenging the sufficiency of the indictment, not the sufficiency of the evidence, the trial court explained that a demurrer was the proper way to challenge the sufficiency of an indictment. The initial question was whether defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal preserved his claim that the indictment failed to allege a violation of &sect; 475.995(5). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in not permitting a mid-trial demurrer. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.630 set out six grounds for demurrer to an indictment. The trial court did not err in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal. Further, on appeal, defendant assigned error to only the denial of his motion for judgment on acquittal but not to his post-verdict motion based on the same ground.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In a petition for review, respondent superintendent challenged the Court of Appeals' (Oregon) holding that a post-conviction court erred in failing to void petitioner prisoner's convictions, arguing that the election to vacate the prisoner's sentences and not her convictions was proper under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.520 of the Post-Conviction Hearing Act and consistent with the post-conviction court's authority under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.530(1)(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The prisoner pled no contest to six counts of first-degree sexual abuse and was sentenced to 366 months in prison. After the post-conviction court set aside her sentences without vacating the no contest pleas, the court of appeals found that the no contest pleas were involuntary because the prisoner was incorrectly told that her sentence could not exceed 226 months; thus, &sect; 138.530(1) required the vacation of the underlying convictions. However, the court of appeals' interpretation of the phrase &quot;rendered the conviction void&quot; in &sect; 138.530(1)(a) improperly limited the broad authority granted to the post-conviction court, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.520, to fashion a remedy to correct the actual prejudice the prisoner suffered. The prisoner entered a no contest plea believing that her prison sentence could not exceed 226 months. Thus, the actual prejudice she suffered was limited to the period of incarceration imposed that exceeded 226 months. The post-conviction court's decision to remand the case with instructions to decrease the sentence from 366 months to 226 months or to allow the prisoner to withdraw her no contest pleas was sufficient to remedy the actual prejudice she suffered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court allowed the State's petition for review of a ruling of the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which agreed with defendant's arguments and remanded for a new trial. Defendant had argued that the State could not reinstate charges once the trial court had dismissed them pursuant to the plea agreement and that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress a breath test with respect to the remaining criminally negligent homicide charge against her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant entered a conditional no contest plea pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.335(3) to the charge of criminally negligent homicide in exchange for the dismissal of the remaining counts against her. In the agreement, defendant reserved the right to appeal the judgment of the trial court denying her pretrial motions. Defendant pursued an appeal and was partially successful. On remand, the trial court reinstated the original charges against defendant and she pled not guilty to all of them. Prior to trial, defendant once again unsuccessfully moved to suppress evidence from a breath test that she had taken while in police custody. After being convicted on all the charges, defendant appealed, and the State then sought review. The court stated that although &sect; 135.335(3) anticipated a return to the status quo ante following a successful appeal and subsequent plea withdrawal, that was not the case when the plea agreement, by it terms, disposed of specific criminal charges. The court next decided that a police officer's presence during defendant's telephone call with an attorney violated her right to a private consultation with her attorney and her rights under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

A jury also convicted him of murdering his four-year-old son and his three-year-old daughter. His case was before the supreme court on automatic and direct review of his sentence of death for seven counts of aggravated murder. The supreme court affirmed, stating that it rejected all of defendant's arguments on based on the manner of his return from Mexico, which was where he was captured. Additionally, his statements to the police should not have been suppressed because, before all three interviews, police either gave defendant Miranda warnings, or reminded him that he had been so advised earlier. And, at no time did defendant ever say that he wished to consult counsel, consult legal advice, or ask for a lawyer. The supreme court also stated that without something more, the striking of a single member of a minority group from a jury was not enough to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination had occurred. Statements made by defendant's wife to her sister about e-mails that she had found were properly admitted under Or. Evid. Code 803.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The attorney met with a client and a former client, knowing that the former client was represented by another attorney. The attorney also revealed a secret of the former client to the disadvantage of the former client. The attorney did not challenge either the trial panel's findings that he violated the disciplinary rules or the sanction that the trial panel imposed for those violations. The Bar also did not challenge either the trial panel's findings or the sanction. Given that procedural posture, the supreme did not believe that an extended discussion of either the facts or the sanction would benefit bench or bar. The supreme court found by clear and convincing evidence, as the trial panel did, that the accused violated four disciplinary rules. The attorney asserted that the Bar initiated this and other disciplinary proceedings against him in retaliation for his Bar activities and also to prevent him from expressing his opinions. The record, however, did not support the attorney's claim that the supreme court did not exercise independent judgment in appointing the members of the Disciplinary Board.</SPAN></P>

The mother asserted that subjecting the son to the presentations was discriminatory under Or. Rev.

The court reversed and held that the fact that the school district permitted a group to provide flyers to be handed out or to make a presentation during lunch period or to include information in a newsletter did not transform all the activities of that group into a public elementary school activity. There was no &quot;differentiated treatment&quot; among the children by those activities. Rather, all children were treated in precisely the same way. Any enrollment in the group was not done by the school district, nor was it done in any public elementary school activity. The school district did nothing more than permit a group to provide nondiscriminatory information to parents and students.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant city challenged a decision of the Oregon Tax Court, which concluded that the city's revenue categorization pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 310.155(3) was not consistent with Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11b (Measure 5) requirements. In so holding, the tax court declared &sect; 310.155(3)&nbsp;unconstitutional and held that Measure 5 required that revenues be categorized according to their intended use and the purpose for which those revenues were raised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The city passed a resolution calling for a four-year levy to institute a new property tax. The bulk of the levy was aimed at school funding, but the city did not categorize the anticipated levy revenues as public school funds. It categorized those revenues as funds for government operations other than the public school system. The court affirmed and held that because the governmental unit in question was not a school unit, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 310.155(3) required that the levy be categorized as funding for &quot;other government&quot; services unless its sole purpose was to fund educational services. Measure 5 required only that the portion of funds that were to be used exclusively for educational services be categorized as funding for &quot;public schools.&quot; To the extent that &sect; 310.155(3) limited the categorization of revenues from mixed-use levies to only one category in circumstances such as this, that provision was inconsistent with Measure 5 and therefore was unconstitutional. Any plausible interpretation of the levy's purpose led to the conclusion that the majority of the revenues were raised specifically for the school system. As a result, those revenues had to be categorized accordingly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State challenged a decision from the Oregon Court of Appeals, which affirmed a circuit court's decision to allow defendant's demurrer in a case charging her with interfering with a peace officer under Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued that Or. Rev.

The State then sought review. In reversing, the supreme court determined that only statutes that by their terms proscribed the exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of assembly or expression were susceptible to a facial overbreadth challenge under Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8 and 26. Because Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;162.247(1)(b) did not do such, defendant could have only mounted an &quot;as applied&quot; challenge. Since there was not a substantial amount of protected conduct proscribed by the statute, it was not overbroad under the First and Fourteenth Amendments either. The statute was not vague because the term &quot;lawful order&quot; granted no discretion and no opportunity for unequal application, in violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 20, 21. Nor did the statute fail to contain an identifiable standard or fail to provide fair warning, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, the statute was not rendered vague by the addition of an exception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner workers' compensation claimant sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Oregon) affirming the Workers' Compensation Board's finding that the exclusion of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.005(7)(b)(B) applied to the claimant's injury that he received at work while riding a coworker's motorcycle. The claimant was sales person for respondent employer, an automobile dealership.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The claimant took a ride on a coworker's motorcycle on the sales lot while the sales people were waiting for customers. As he was pulling into a service bay to park it, another employee backed a company pickup into the claimant, severely injuring him. The administrative law judge (ALJ) ruled in favor of the claimant and the Board reversed. The court held that in the context of the case, riding the motorcycle was a &quot;recreational activity.&quot; Even though the claimant's injury did not occur as the result of engaging in a recreational activity, it did occur while engaging in that recreational activity. The legislature intended that the Board should determine the degree to which a recreational activity served the employer's work-related interests and the degree to which the worker engaged in the activity for the his personal pleasure. Given that the claimant stipulated that his riding of the motorcycle served no business purpose, substantial evidence supported the Board's finding that there was no work-related reason for claimant to be riding the motorcycle at the time of the accident and that the fundamental or principal reason that he rode the motorcycle was for his personal pleasure.</SPAN></P>

The city appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment. After the final appellate judgment, the company filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking to set aside the judgment. The company claimed that the Court of Appeals &quot;did not lawfully exist.&quot; It alleged that the 1910 initiative measure that amended Or. Const. art. VII violated the Oregon Constitution as it had been adopted improperly; therefore, the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction and no authority to overturn the 1995 judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city, holding that the company had filed its challenge to the 1910 initiative too late to comply with any applicable statutes of limitations and that it had no standing. The court affirmed, ruling that the company was barred under the doctrine of claim preclusion to collaterally attack the prior judgment. The court noted that the company asserted the same claim that it asserted in the earlier case, that it sought recovery from the same party, and that the &quot;grounds or theories&quot; that the company asserted here could have been raised and litigated in the prior case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner sign company appealed the decision of the Court of Appeals (Oregon) affirming the trial court's ruling on decisions of respondents, the department of transportation and the driver and motor vehicles branch (State), which cited the company for displaying one or more of its billboards without a permit in violation of the Oregon Motorist Information Act (OMIA), Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 377.700 to 377.840 and 377.992 (1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The company asserted that various provisions of the OMIA, on their face, violated the federal and state constitutions. The court held that because the OMIA's permit and fee requirements focused on covering the cost of a content-neutral permit scheme and were implemented in a nonarbitrary manner, the requirements did not constitute prior restraints on expression in violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Also, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 377.729 expressly tied the fee to the cost of the regulatory program. Thus, the court could not conclude that the fee requirement was an impermissible restriction on speech. Furthermore, Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 did not prohibit reasonable time, place, and manner regulation of speech imposed for reasons apart from the message of the speech. However, on-premises signs, which did not require a permit, and off-premises signs, which did require a permit, could pose the same risk to safety and have the same adverse effect on scenic beauty. Therefore, the legislature's decision to limit one of those types of expression more stringently than the other because of its content was an impermissible restriction on the &quot;subject&quot; of expression under art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the agency orders and remanded to the respective agencies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff applicant filed an action against defendant Oregon Department of Transportation, which arose from a dispute under the Oregon Motorist Information Act (OMIA), Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 377.700 to 377.840. The case was before the court on certified questions from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The applicant sought to display a large sign. He challenged the variance provision of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 377.735(2), arguing that it violated the First Amendment because it allowed unbridled discretion to grant or deny a variance. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit certified questions to the court regarding the OMIA. In answering the questions, the court determined that good cause shown in the context of &sect; 377.735(2) meant that the party seeking the variance was required to demonstrate a sufficient reason to permit it to display a temporary sign that did not meet the requirements of &sect;&nbsp;377.735(1)(b). The interpretation of the phrase &quot;for good cause shown&quot; was not a phrase entirely within the discretion of the Department. The discretion was limited by Or. Admin. R. 734-060-0175(2), and it was not permitted to disregard this rule as long as it was in effect. Moreover, the Department's discretion was limited by the state and federal constitutions. Finally, Oregon law required the Department to respond to a variance request within a reasonable time, and judicial review was available if the Department failed to act within that time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The underlying litigation resulted from a change in state law regarding who must pay employee pension contributions amounting to 6 percent of salary, a change later held unconstitutional. Before that change was declared unconstitutional, the county responded to it with a payroll scheme that deducted 6 percent from certain employees' pay, but also simultaneously paid the same employees a 5.7 percent pay increase. Because the law requiring the 6 percent deduction was held unconstitutional, the previously authorized 6 percent deductions became unlawful retrospectively. The employees whose paychecks were affected argued that they were entitled to the 6 percent of their salary that the county unlawfully deducted from their paychecks. The circuit court awarded 0.3 percent damages, and the court of appeals affirmed. The reviewing court held that the &quot;actual damages&quot; under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 652.615 was 0.3 percent, not 6 percent. Of the 6 percent deducted for retirement contributions, the county returned 5.7 percent simultaneously, in every paycheck, so only the net amount, 0.3 percent, ever was &quot;deducted.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellants, counties and state officials, appealed a judgment of the Marion County Circuit Court (Oregon) that was entered in favor of respondent property owners and declared that Ballot Measure 37 (2004), codified at Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.352, was unconstitutional. Measure 37 required state and local governments to compensate property owners for the reduction in the fair market value of their property resulting from land use regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In lieu of providing just compensation, Measure 37, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.352(8), allowed the governing body that enacted a land use regulation to refrain from applying the regulation. The trial court declared that Measure 37 was invalid. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in declaring that Measure 37 was unconstitutional because Measure 37 did not violate separation of powers constraints and did not limit the plenary power of the legislature or the people to enact legislation as provided in Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. Also, Measure 37 did violate the equal privileges and immunities guarantee of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 by limiting its provisions to property owners that had acquired their land prior to enactment of the land use regulations that they wished to avoid. The court concluded that the property owners failed to meet their burden to show that Measure 37 bore no reasonable relation to a legitimate state interest. The court found that the people, in exercising their initiative power, were free to enact Measure 37 in furtherance of policy objectives such as compensating landowners for a diminution in property value resulting from land use regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the trial court judgment that held ballot Measure 37 was unconstitutional and remanded the case for entry of judgment in favor of appellants.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 250.085(2), petitioner electors asked the court to review respondent Attorney General's certified ballot title for a proposed initiative measure that the Oregon Secretary of State designated as Initiative Petition 51 (2006).  The electors challenged the caption, the &quot;yes&quot; vote result statement, the &quot;no&quot; vote result statement, and the summary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The proposed measure related to abortion notification requirements and a proposed enforcement scheme. The court agreed with the electors that the caption had to be modified. The court noted that it was undebatable that the new enforcement scheme in the proposed measure would enact major changes to Oregon law that likely would be significant to the voting public. By failing to give any hint of the new remedial scheme in the caption, the Attorney General understated the scope of the legal changes that the proposed measure would enact, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.035(2)(a). The court next determined that the Attorney General's &quot;yes&quot; vote result statement did not include any reference to the measure's proposed administrative discipline feature, which was necessary to describe accurately the enforcement scheme in the proposed measure. The court also determined that the &quot;no&quot; vote result statement was incomplete. It failed to disclose current Oregon law on parental involvement in abortion decisions for minor females younger than 15 years old. Finally, the court found that the summary required modification to reflect pertinent law concerning females younger than 15 years old.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner tobacco company appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which reinstated the trial court's award in respondent representative's action for negligence and fraud, asserting a causal connection between her husband's smoking habit and his death. The jury awarded respondent punitive damages of $79.5 million. The trial court reduced that amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court of appeals noted that the jury could have found that petitioner had little doubt that cigarette smoking was causally related to a number of diseases. Petitioner continued to assert that the hazard of cigarette smoking to health was uncertain when it knew that there was no controversy about that subject. The court affirmed, and held that evidence of similar conduct against other parties may be relevant to a punitive damage award. Thus the trial court properly refused to give petitioner's proposed instruction that the jury could not punish petitioner for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons. There could be no dispute that petitioner's conduct was extraordinarily reprehensible. Petitioner spread false information to suggest to the public that doubts remained about that issue. Knowing that it was putting smokers' lives at risk, it continued to do so for nearly half a century. The first Gore guidepost favored a very significant punitive damage award. The court concluded that the ratio guidepost considered only harm to the plaintiff. Under such outrageous circumstances, the court concluded that the jury's punitive damage award comported with due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State filed an original proceeding in mandamus, which sought a determination of whether a trial court had the authority under Oregon law to submit certain sentence enhancement factors to a jury for factual determination under the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's indictment alleged several aggravating factors. The trial court refused to submit the aggravating factors regarding defendant's past crimes and a vulnerable victim to the jury. The State then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus. In granting the writ, the court determined that the trial court erred by failing to submit the sentence enhancement factors to the jury. First, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 136.130, 136.320 authorized the trial court to submit all questions of fact to the jury that a criminal defendant was entitled to have the jury decide. Next, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 137.669, 137.671(1), and Or. Admin. R. 213-008-0002 did not place any limitation on the use of the jury to make the factual findings necessary to support the imposition of an enhanced sentence.

The trial court had dismissed the action filed by plaintiffs, a trucking association and trucking companies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs had sought a judgment declaring that the provisions of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 825.480(1), (4), and (5), that offered a flat-fee tax option to certain non-farm-use carriers, as well as similar provisions for farm-use trucks, violated the Commerce Clause. The court of appeals concluded that the flat-fee alternatives for non-farm-use carriers violated the Commerce Clause by creating a fee structure that had a discriminatory effect on trucks engaged in interstate commerce. On review, the court determined that Complete Auto Transit's four-factor test was the appropriate analytical format for reviewing the issues presented. It then analyzed whether the flat-fee option at issue was both malapportioned and discriminatory. Applying the internal consistency test, the court discerned no apportionment problem under the Complete Auto Transit analysis. The flat-fee option was aimed at operations that took place primarily in Oregon and did not tax an interstate truck's entry into Oregon. Noting that the flat-fee option did not facially discriminate against interstate commerce, the court rejected plaintiffs' hypothetical projections as adequate evidence of discrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the decision of the court of appeals pertaining to non-farm-use carriers and affirmed the remainder of that decision. The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants, owners of a nude dancing club, were convicted of violating a local ordinance that required, among other things, that entertainers at such clubs remain at least four feet away from the patrons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court of appeals found that, even if the ordinance were directed at expression, it was not unconstitutional because nude dancing was not protected under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. In reversing, the court found that the four-foot ordinance violated art. I, &sect; 8. By its terms, the ordinance applied only to one disfavored type of communication (nude performances) in one disfavored type of establishment (one that regularly featured that type of entertainment). Thus, Nyssa, Or., City Code &sect; 5.10.130(17), restrained free expression. The court disagreed with the conclusion that the rule fell within a well-established historical exception for laws regulating public sexual conduct. A historical exception could not be established with respect to laws directed at regulating the portrayal of sexual matters merely by showing that similar regulations were longstanding at the time of the adoption of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, if those historical criminal prohibitions were directed exclusively at protecting the hearer or the viewer from a disfavored message. The ordinance was unconstitutional on its face, and defendants' convictions had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals (Oregon) reversed that award under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31.715. Plaintiff sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;31.715 precluded uninsured drivers from recovering noneconomic damages for injuries sustained in an action arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. Plaintiff argued that the right to recover such damages was a fundamental right and that &sect; 31.715 violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court disagreed, finding that no absolute common-law right that existed when the Oregon Constitution was drafted in 1857 would have guaranteed a remedy for her injuries to a person in plaintiff's position as violator of the law requiring drivers to have insurance. The court also found that no other source of law, including Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, authorized the claim for noneconomic damages. Therefore, the legislature's choice to preclude uninsured drivers from recovering noneconomic damages also did not implicate the right to a jury trial under art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The inmate sought administrative review of an order that delayed his release date for two years and required that he undergo a psychological evaluation before release. In response, the Board entered a new order that changed his projected release date to one year but retained the requirement that he undergo an evaluation. The inmate sought review in the lower court. The Board moved to dismiss, arguing that its order did not adversely affect or aggrieve the inmate in the manner necessary to establish appellate jurisdiction. The lower court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, the court found that whatever the merits of the inmate's argument, he did not receive all of the relief that he had sought when the Board entered the second order. The second order placed the inmate under a disability that, he asserted, could not be imposed on him. Accordingly, the inmate was &quot;adversely affected or aggrieved&quot; by the second order for purposes of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.335(1)(a). The inmate's legal theory might not succeed, but he established that he was entitled to have it addressed either directly on the merits or, if the doctrine applied, as a matter of issue preclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which affirmed the trial court's sentencing of defendant upon his guilty plea to first-degree theft, first-degree burglary, and identity theft. The trial court relied upon defendant's prior juvenile adjudication to increase his criminal history score and to impose an upward departure sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">No sentencing stipulations had been made as part of defendant's plea agreement. Defendant argued that because his prior juvenile adjudication had lacked a jury trial, the fact of his adjudication could not be used to increase his sentence and remain consonant with Apprendi. The court held that it was undisputed that defendant's prior juvenile adjudication qualified as &quot;any fact&quot; under Apprendi and Blakely, and that the State did not present evidence of the juvenile adjudication to a jury, but used the adjudication specifically to lengthen his prison sentence beyond the maximum that he otherwise could have received. Defendant expressly objected to the use of the juvenile adjudication at his sentencing hearing. Therefore, defendant's acknowledgment of a prior juvenile adjudication in filling out his guilty plea did not amount to either an admission or a knowing waiver of his jury trial right for sentencing purposes. Because the prior adjudication's existence was not proved to a trier of fact or admitted by defendant for sentencing purposes, the trial court's use of the juvenile adjudication as an enhancement factor violated the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the decision of the court of appeals. The conviction was affirmed and the sentence was vacated.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 18 or U.S. Const. amend. V.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The owner was a company that bought a 40-acre tract of property, which it intended to log; however, bald eagles made a nest in the tract. Pursuant to Or. Admin. R. 629-605-0170(1)(d), the owner had to submit a written plan to the State Forester before engaging in any logging activities that might damage the nest site. The owner received approval to log all but nine acres surrounding the nest site. After the nesting season, the owner sought but was denied approval to log the remaining nine acres. It filed an unsuccessful suit, but the court of appeals reversed. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court, finding that in determining whether the regulation deprived the owner of all economically beneficial use of the property and thus took the property, the proper focus was the entire 40-acre parcel, not the nine acre parcel affected by the regulation. The court then held that because the owner's property had an economically viable use, the regulation did not effect a taking under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 18. Furthermore, under the whole parcel rule, the owner's U.S. Const. amend. V claim based on the holding in Lucas failed because the owner was able to log 31 acres of its property.</SPAN></P>

The officer also asked for, and received, defendant's consent to search him. The search revealed a vial of amphetamines. The state supreme court affirmed the court of appeals and held that (1) the stop of defendant was unlawful as the officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that defendant had committed a crime under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 131.615(1) (1995) and (2) Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;9 required the exclusion of the drugs found after the search as defendant's consent was not spontaneous but, instead, was made only in response to the officer's request that defendant allow a search while waiting for the results of the warrant check, which in conjunction with the unlawful seizure vitiated his consent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court convicted each defendant of being a felon in possession of a firearm, a violation of Or. Rev.

I, &sect; 27. The court of appeals disagreed and affirmed the trial court's decisions to overrule defendants' demurrers. Defendants appealed, but the court affirmed because it concluded that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.270(1) was not unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. The court rejected the State's argument that the drafters' use of &quot;the people&quot; in Or. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State appealed a decision of the Multnomah County Circuit Court (Oregon) dismissing with prejudice an indictment charging defendant with aggravated murder under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.095(2)(d) after the State refused to proceed with the prosecution because it intended to appeal a pretrial exclusionary ruling that the trial court had made under Or. Evid. Code 403.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Before defendant's aggravated murder trial, the trial court ruled that the State could not prove one of defendant's other crimes through the testimony of the surviving victim because the testimony would be prejudicial under &sect; 403. The court reversed the dismissal, holding that in reviewing the legislative history, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.060(2) authorized the State's appeal to the court. As to the original merits, the court noted that when a prosecutor is not ready for trial, and a defendant moves for dismissal, then Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.120 first requires the trial court to determine whether the prosecutor has shown &quot;any sufficient cause&quot; for postponing the defendant's trial. Because the State had the right to appeal the ruling, the trial court did not have authority under &sect; 136.120 to dismiss the indictment. However, the trial court did not err by applying Or. Evid. Code 403 to decide the admissibility of testimony at issue in the guilt phase of defendant's trial, but the trial court abused its discretion under in choosing instead to exclude the testimony altogether. Finally, the court rejected defendant's challenge to the relevance of the other crimes evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The order of the circuit court dismissing the indictment and the judgment of acquittal were reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings. The cross-appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff homeowners filed a products liability suit against defendant siding manufacturing company. The U.S. District Court for the District or Oregon certified a question for the court that the court revised to read: whether &sect; 2 of the 2003 amendments to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.905, 2003 Or. Laws 768, &sect; 2, violated the separation of powers clause in Or. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1 or Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The homeowners sought to recover damages allegedly resulting from improper installation of an exterior stucco siding system. In 2001, they filed a lawsuit against the siding manufacturer that was dismissed as time-barred under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.905. The Oregon legislature amended &sect; 30.905, effective January 1, 2004, to allow a products liability action to be commenced within two years after the date on which a plaintiff discovers or reasonably could have discovered the injury and revived any such cause of action that was dismissed as untimely prior to January 1, 2004. The homeowners then filed the instant suit. The court determined that in enacting the 2003 amendment to &sect; 30.905, the legislature did not retroactively declare what the law had been; not did the amendment operate to annul or set aside a final judgment of a court on the merits; rather, it gave litigants a new right to file an action and in so doing, the legislature performed the legislative function of &quot;declaring what the law shall be&quot; with respect to newly filed claims. Accordingly, the court found there was no separation of powers violation and that the statute did not violate the Oregon constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, defendant State appealed a circuit court judgment that Or. Rev. Stat. ch. 106 violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, by denying certain benefits to same-sex couples that otherwise were available to married opposite-sex couples by virtue of their marriages. The Oregon Court of Appeals certified the appeal to the instant court pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19.405(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs were nine same-sex couples, an advocacy group, a civil liberties organization, and a county. The chair of the county board of commissioners had ordered the county's records management division to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples who applied for such licenses from the county. Plaintiffs argued that the right to marry was a &quot;privilege&quot; under the Oregon Constitution and that Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, prohibited using sexual orientation or gender as a basis to deny such a privilege. The court held that Oregon law placed the regulation of marriage exclusively within the province of the state's legislative power. It also held that the use of the word &quot;policy&quot; in Or. Ballot Measure 36 (2004), which amended the Oregon Constitution, was intended to signal a presently enforceable tenet of state constitutional law. Under the Oregon Constitution, marriage in Oregon was limited to opposite-sex couples. Thus, the claims of five of the same-sex couples that they were entitled as a matter of state law to obtain marriage licenses and to marry failed. The county did not have the authority to issue the licenses for the marriages in question. The licenses were void ab initio.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed a civil action against defendant for personal injuries, including damages for the fractured teeth. Defendant claimed that the issues related to the dental injuries were precluded because of the arbitration. The trial court did not allow the defense of issue preclusion, but the appellate court reversed and found that the dental injury claim was precluded. The court held that plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that the words of Or. Rev.

The court held that trial counsel's failure to dismiss that juror did not prejudice petitioner because he questioned her at length and petitioner presented no evidence to show that the juror was actually biased. Also, counsel stated that petitioner refused to allow him to negotiate a plea agreement. Although trial counsel's conduct of some aspects fell below the required standard of skill, petitioner did not prove that any of the mistakes affected the result of the prosecution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In consolidated cases, petitioners, current and former public employees who were members of the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS), filed an action against respondents, the State, its agencies, the Public Employees Retirement Board (PERB), and other public employers, seeking a declaration that provisions of Or. Rev. Stat. ch. 238 (2003) unconstitutionally impaired the PERS statutory contract and an injunction to enjoin its implementation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioners challenged the discontinuation of contributions into their regular accounts under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 238.200(4), which amended Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 238.200 (2001); and claimed that the PERS contracts were impaired because the contributions into an Individual Account Program (IAP) instead of their regular accounts were no longer guaranteed annual crediting at no less than the assumed earnings rate as provided in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 238.255 (2001); were no longer subject to the Money Match formula under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 238.300 (2001); and would not be enhanced by annual COLAs at retirement as provided in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 238.360. The court held that the use of IAPs did not impair the contract and that members had no contractual right to a credit of annual earnings in excess of the assumed earnings rate. However, the court held that 2003 Or. Laws 67, &sect;&sect; 5 to 8, as amended, which eliminated the annual assumed earnings rate credit to regular accounts of Tier One members, substantially impaired obligations under the contract in violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 21; therefore they were void. Also the court held that the COLA suspension provision in 2003 Or. Laws 67, &sect; 10(3) was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's appeal of his conviction and sentence for assault was before the court on remand from the United States Supreme Court. In the court's prior decision, it had affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of its Blakely decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On remand, defendant argued that, under Blakely, the sentence that the trial court imposed and that the court had affirmed violated his federal jury trial and due process rights. The court held that the Supreme Court's Blakely decision compelled it to reverse its previous decision. The court noted that the trial court had authority to impose its upward departure of defendant's sentence only because it made additional findings of fact, which was precisely the procedure that the Supreme Court found did not comply with the Sixth Amendment's jury trial guarantee. The Supreme Court held that, under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant had a right to have additional facts that might increase his or her sentence beyond the otherwise applicable maximum sentence decided by a jury, rather than by a trial judge. Therefore, defendant's sentence was constitutionally impermissible and had to be vacated. The court saw no basis upon which to sever a part of the Oregon Felony Sentencing Guidelines as the State suggested. Because the court had not held that a part of the Guidelines was unconstitutional, it could identify no unconstitutional part of the Guidelines that might be appropriate to sever.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgments of the court of appeals and the trial court and remanded the case to the trial court. If the parties agreed, the trial court could sentence defendant to a sentence not exceeding the upper limit of the presumptive sentence under the Guidelines. If they disagreed, their positions for alternative means of determining the proper sentence had to be presented to and decided by the trial court in the first instance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">At issue was whether the Secretary was authorized to decline to count elector signatures on signature sheets that he found did not comply with applicable legal requirements in determining whether sufficient valid elector signatures supported the certificate of nomination. The court held that the Secretary was entitled to relief from the order. The Secretary determined, in the lawful exercise of delegated authority, that a circulator's violation of certification requirements deprived the affected signature sheet of the certification that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 249.740(4) required. The Secretary of State's determination advanced the legislature's objective of deterring fraud in the nomination process. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 247.005 did not purport to invalidate rules and procedures that the Secretary lawfully adopted pursuant to statutory command or delegated authority. The noncompliance by several counties with the Secretary's written instructions, issued under his express authority in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 246.120, threatened a violation of the uniform application of his requirements for circulator certification.

The court observed that the state constitution separated the power and functions of the departments of government pursuant to Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 and vested in the courts only the judicial power. The court reviewed the history of Or. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1 and determined that the framers of the state constitution would have understood the grant of judicial power in the restrained sense of an authority limited to the adjudication of an existing controversy. There was no exception for moot cases that were capable of repetition, yet evading review. The court overruled Perry v.

The supreme court reversed the decision of the appellate court, and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The 2001 amendments to &sect; 109.119 applied because those amendments were applicable to all custody proceedings filed before, on, or after July 31, 2001.

The supreme court found facts that supported four of the factors listed in &sect; 109.119 that could be considered in determining whether the presumption was rebutted, including the grandparents' role as the primary caretakers to the children after the mother's death; the father's denial of contact between the children and grandparents by moving the children to another state; and the risk to the children that granting custody to the father would be detrimental to them.</SPAN></P>

The record supported the finding of the trial court that there had been enough articulable suspicion on the part of the officer for him to be concerned about his safety. The officer's questions about the bag's contents were based on a reasonable suspicion that defendant posed an immediate threat of serious injury to him and therefore did not violate defendant's rights under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Several defendants were charged with disorderly conduct in violation of Or. Rev.

The trial court sustained the demurrers, concluding that &sect; 166.025(1)(e) was unconstitutionally vague. The Court of Appeals (Oregon) reversed. The court allowed review of the consolidated cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.025(1)(e), a person committed one variation of the crime of disorderly conduct when the person: (1) with the intent to cause, or by recklessly creating a risk of causing, public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm; (2) congregated with other persons in a public place; and (3) refused to comply with a lawful order of the police to disperse. The court concluded that, on its face, &sect; 166.025(1)(e) was unconstitutionally overbroad because it restrained conduct that Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8 and 26 protected. The court stated that the difficulty with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.025(1)(e) was that a person ordered to disperse violated the statute regardless of whether any harm resulted from the refusal to disperse, the continued congregation with others, or the proscribed mental state. Thus, the statute applied to an individual who, in response to an order to disperse, abandoned whatever activity in which they were engaged that made the order lawful in the first place, but continued peaceably to congregate with others, with the intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm or recklessly created the risk of causing public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm.</SPAN></P>

The court allowed review to consider the question of whether the State could rely on a statutory presumption in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 810.439(1)(b) to prove a traffic violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A police officer using &quot;photo radar&quot; determined that a car registered to defendant had exceeded the speed limit. Pursuant to &sect; 810.439(1), the State mailed a citation to defendant alleging that she had committed a speeding violation and defendant asked for a hearing. At the hearing, the State relied on the presumption in &sect; 810.439(1)(b) to prove that defendant was the driver. Defendant moved to dismiss the case on the ground that due process prevented the State from relying on the presumption to prove an element of its case. The circuit court rejected defendant's constitutional challenges and found that defendant had committed the violation. The lower appellate court affirmed the judgment. On further appeal, the court held that the State validly relied on the presumption in &sect; 810.439(1)(b). The court stated that, when the legislature referred to a &quot;rebuttable presumption&quot; in &sect; 810.439(1)(b), it intended to refer to the procedural device described in Or. Evid. Code 308. Additionally, the presumption did not violate due process, as the legislature's determination that the registered owner was driving his or her car was not so unreasonable as to be a purely arbitrary mandate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court undertook automatic and direct review of a sentence of death imposed by the Deschutes County Circuit Court (Oregon), which, in a jury trial, convicted defendant of aggravated murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">While committing a burglary, defendant and two accomplices fatally shot the homeowners. The prosecution conceded that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury as to life imprisonment sentencing options pursuant to former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.150(5)(a)(A), (B) (1997) (recodified as Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.012(2)(a)(A), (B) (1999)), after defendant requested such instructions and expressly waived all ex post facto guarantees that otherwise would have protected him from retroactive application of the statute. Consequently, it was necessary to vacate the sentence of death. The court, in providing guidance for remand, stated that the prohibition against ex post facto laws contained in Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 precluded the admission of aggravating evidence under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.150(1)(a), (c)(B). Victim-impact evidence under &sect; 163.150(1)(a), (c)(B) was admissible pursuant to Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 42. The Ex Post Facto Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 was not implicated because the minimum quantum of evidence required to obtain a sentence of death was not reduced. Under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.150(1) and the Eighth Amendment, alibi evidence was admissible in mitigation.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals (Oregon) affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>

At defendant's sentencing, the State argued that the trial court should impose an upward durational departure based on the aggravating factor that defendant's crime was motivated, in part, by the victim's race or color. The trial court agreed and sentenced defendant accordingly. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court violated his state and federal jury trial rights and his federal due process rights by imposing a departure sentence based on a fact not pleaded in the indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The State argued that the sentence was within the authorized range and was less than the five-year maximum sentence for Class C felonies under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.605(3). In affirming defendant's sentence, the supreme court held that defendant's sentence did not exceed the prescribed statutory maximum under &sect; 161.605. Among other things, the supreme court noted that it was not impermissible for a durational departure to exceed the presumptive sentence for an offense.</SPAN></P>

The objectors contended that the ballot title did not substantially comply with the requirements of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.035(5). The court determined that most of the initiative substantially complied with &sect; 250.035(5). The caption reasonably identified the subject matter of the initiative, pursuant to &sect; 250.035(2)(a). The initiative did not have to state that it was a prohibition on abortion. Further, it did not have to disclose that the proposed measure created no medical emergency exception. Moreover, the initiative had a sufficient statement that described the result if the voters approved or rejected the measure, pursuant to &sect; 250.035(2)(b), (c). The &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; statement contained in the measure was adequate. However, the court found that the summary improperly stated the law regarding informed consent under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 677.097. Therefore, a modification was necessary.</SPAN></P>

He was arrested in California and extradited to Oregon, where he was convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to death. On review, defendant asked the Supreme Court of Oregon to reverse his conviction or vacate his sentence of death. The court did neither, because defendant failed to show trial error. There was no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's demurrer to the indictment; the sentencing statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant sought review of a decision by the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which affirmed the trial court decision. The trial court convicted defendant of unlawful possession of a firearm, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.250, and rejected his defense that, as an employee at a convenience store, his actions fell within the statutory &quot;place of business&quot; exception to the general license requirement for persons carrying concealed weapons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was working alone and had responsibility for a convenience store when he was arrested for carrying a gun without a license. He argued that the &quot;place of business&quot; exception applied to him because a &quot;person's place of business&quot; was the place where that individual was employed. The court disagreed, finding that the &quot;place of business&quot; exception in &sect; 166.250(2)(b) applied only to the owner of a business. The court reasoned that in 1925, the time of enactment, the phrase &quot;place of business&quot; referred to a location where a person conducted that person's own business, rather than to a location where a person was an employee. Further, the history demonstrated a legislative intent to carve out a limited and specific exception. The court agreed with the appeals court that if the general prohibition against possessing a concealed firearm without a license was constitutional, which defendant conceded, then &sect; 166.250(2)(b), which allowed greater freedom to possess firearms, could not violate the constitutional right to bear arms. For purposes of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, drawing a distinction between business owners and employees was not irrational.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court agreed. Although some of the evidence indicated that the victim was depressed and obsessed with defendant, the excluded statements were not merely cumulative of that evidence. The statements that defendant proffered were qualitatively different than the evidence that the jury heard. The excluded evidence went directly to the heart of defendant's factual theory of the case. Defendant sought to show that the victim was suicidal and obsessed with defendant and that, when defendant rejected her, she shot herself. The evidence at issue potentially was influential, because it tended to complete the picture of defendant's version of the events. Defendant was entitled to prove his theory of the case by presenting relevant, admissible evidence to the jury. The trial court's error in excluding the evidence could have affected the jury's determination whether there was reasonable doubt that defendant murdered the victim.</SPAN></P>

The Tax Court determined the tax violated the distributor's free speech rights. The Tax Court entered the State's proposed declaratory judgment. The appellate court concluded that the Tax Court did not commit legal error in entering the more limited judgment. It was unnecessary for the Tax Court to rule on the constitutionality of the statute as to broadcasts from events in Oregon. The distributor was not entitled to attorney fees or costs. The State had a right to rely on the opinion of the attorney general. The distributor and the assorted telecasters that it purported to represent were not &quot;all citizens,&quot; neither could they pass for a significant part of the &quot;public at large.&quot; The distributor also secured for itself a special and substantial pecuniary interest not shared with the general public.</SPAN></P>

The fact that the City allowed the payment of the charge over 10 years only if the taxpayers waived all irregularities or defects in the improvement proceedings did not preclude the charge from being a local improvement assessment because the conditional waiver added by voter initiative to Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff challengers of a ballot measure, who were successful challengers of the measure, which violated the separate-vote requirement of the Oregon Constitution, sought an award of attorney fees from defendant State and intervenor state officials for the challengers' efforts in securing that outcome. The challengers sought attorney fees totaling $ 21,992, which represented 80 hours of time devoted to their successful effort.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The challengers asserted they were entitled to an award of attorney fees under the rationale that a &quot;court of equity&quot; had inherent power to award attorney fees to a prevailing litigant in appropriate circumstances. The challengers asserted that such an award was justified because they successfully defended the integrity of the amendment and initiative process, an achievement that benefitted all Oregonians. The court held that none of the challengers were disqualified from receiving an award of attorney fees on the ground that the dominant characteristic of their case was that they were vindicating a private interest of their own, rather than vindicating an interest of the public generally. The case on the merits involved a declaratory judgment proceeding which had the power to grant equitable remedies where appropriate. An injunction against enforcement of the measure was not necessary as it was assumed that responsible State officials would honor the court's declaration without the necessity of an accompanying injunction. It was sufficient under the circumstances that the challengers invoked the court's declaratory judgment powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The challengers petition against the State was allowed and the challengers were awarded $ 21,992 as reasonable attorney fees on review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted in 1990 of first-degree sexual abuse. In 1997, defendant was charged with failing to register as a sex offender, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 181.599 (1995). Defendant claimed the statute was unconstitutional in that it violated the ex post facto clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Defendant was convicted, and the Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On appeal, defendant argued that, because Oregon did not have a sex offender registration law when he committed sexual abuse in 1987, requiring him to register as a sex offender under the 1995 law was an unconstitutional ex post facto application of law. The appellate court rejected defendant's arguments. The registration requirement did not subject defendant to undue restraint in the form of comprehensive or intrusive police scrutiny, control, or monitoring. Similarly, to the extent that defendant was deterred by the registration requirement from committing future crimes, the deterrent effect was a secondary or ancillary one, similar to the deterrent effect associated with civil sanctions such as driver license suspensions, bar suspensions, and disbarments. The registration requirement was regulatory, and no proof was presented that the registration scheme was punitive either in purpose or effect. Thus, because requiring defendant to register as a sex offender did not impose increased punishment not annexed to defendant's 1987 sex crime, it did not violate the ex post facto clause of the state or federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff guardian filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon alleging that a foster parent abused her daughter while she was in the custody of Children Services Division of the State of Oregon (CSD), and that defendants, individual agents and employees of CSD, were negligent. The instant court accepted certified questions from the district court concerning the limitation of causes of action for such a tort.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The questions certified for review concerned whether Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(1) which limited a cause of action for any tort of a public employee to an action against the public body only and capped damages violated the terms of Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10, 17, or 20. The appellate court held that because the damages &quot;cap&quot; was not implicated in every case and did not render the remedy available to plaintiff incapable of restoring the right that has been injured. Thus, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(1), on its face, did not violate the remedy clause under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Further, the legislature did not violate Oregon's remedy guarantee by requiring substitution of the State as the only defendant in the action. The guardian had no &quot;civil action&quot; against the individual defendants. Thus, there was no claim to which a right to a jury trial could attach and &sect; 30.265(1), on its face, did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. Finally, the legislature could reasonably conclude that providing public workers with personal immunity from liability for torts would assist public bodies in recruiting qualified persons. Accordingly, &sect; 30.265(1), on its face, did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In it's answers to the district court's certified questions, the appellate court held the statute which abolished any tort claim against individual officers, employees, or agents of a public body and substituted the public body as the sole defendant, did not violate the Oregon Constitution with regard to the right to a remedy, the right to a jury trial, or the privileges and immunities clause.</SPAN></P>

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The United States District Court (Oregon) granted the State's motion to intervene to assert a claim under Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A jury assessed punitive damages against defendants for the wrongful use of civil proceedings and fraudulent transfer of real property. The jury's decision was affirmed on appeal. Defendants abandoned further appeal, and the only issue that remained was the proper distribution of the punitive damages award. The State intervened as a judgment creditor to assert the State's claim under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18.540 (1995) to a portion of the punitive damages award. Plaintiffs then challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 18.540 on multiple grounds. Because Oregon appellate courts had not previously decided whether, by allocating to the State a 60-percent share in punitive damage awards, &sect; 18.540 violated provisions of the state constitution, the district court certified questions to the Oregon Supreme Court. The supreme court held that &sect; 18.540 did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10, 17, or 18; Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1; Or. Const.&nbsp;art. IV, &sect; 18; Or. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">This was an automatic and direct review of a judgment of convictions and sentence of death imposed on defendant by the Lane County Circuit Court (Oregon). Defendant had been convicted of aggravated murder, murder by abuse, two counts of sexual penetration in the first degree, and one count of abuse of a corpse in the second degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued, among other things, that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.095(1)(e), either alone or in conjunction with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.115(1)(c), was vague as to the mental state required with regard to the result of death when a homicide occurs as a result of maiming or torture. According to defendant, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.095(1)(e) violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 20 and 21, and the 8th and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution. The instant court concluded that the trial court properly denied defendant's vagueness challenge to the aggravated murder count of the indictment. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to prohibit the death penalty.  Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.150(1) (1995) did not violate the 8th and 14th Amendments. Defendant did not demonstrate that the trial court manifestly abused its discretion in denying his motion to excuse a challenged juror for cause. The trial court did not err in asking potential jurors if they were not registered voters or had been convicted of a felony in the last 15 years, and in excusing those who responded affirmatively. The instant court rejected defendant's assignments of error regarding the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The hotel owned two properties in Portland, within Multnomah County. Taxes that were assessed against the hotel were disbursed to the urban renewal agency. The hotel argued that part of the taxes that were designated on the tax bill for schools was actually paid to the urban renewal agency in excess of constitutionally established limits. The Tax Court held that taxes assessed on property located within an urban renewal area and used to pay urban renewal indebtedness did not have to be characterized as taxes raised to fund government operations other than the public school system. The state supreme court held that as Or. Const. art. XI, &sect;11b established the rate that taxes could be imposed on property for government operations other than schools, the urban agency could not receive an amount greater than that rate. Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11 did not change the method of categorization and limits established in Or. Const. art. XI, &sect;11b. To the extent that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 310.150(7) did not require the taxing district to determine the appropriate category for an item of tax be based on the purpose to which that item of tax was dedicated, the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Another set of petitioners alleged that the Secretary of State improperly diluted the vote of Native Americans. The court granted only the petition of the set of petitioners who asserted the census data error, holding that the Secretary of State incorrectly assumed that, in determining the population of a district in the face of an admitted error in the census data, he nonetheless had to rely solely on official census data.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant corporate taxpayer appealed a judgment of the Oregon Tax Court, which determined that proceeds the taxpayer received in settlement of a tort judgment were apportionable business income.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayer argued that: (1) the tax court erred in determining that the proceeds in question were business income; (2) the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the United States Constitution prohibited Oregon from taxing the proceeds; and (3) the tax court erred by apportioning the proceeds under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 314.670 (1987) in a manner that grossly and unconstitutionally distorted the taxpayer's activity in Oregon. Respondent Department of Revenue contended that an agreement between the taxpayer and another corporation for the taxpayer to purchase 3/7 of the corporation's stock gave rise to the proceeds. The instant court concluded that the proceeds were business income under the transactional test. Steps taken by the taxpayer to acquire an interest in established oil reserves were steps taken in the regular course of the taxpayer's trade or business. The fact that the taxpayer sought and received damages from a tortfeasor based on the cost of developing one billion barrels of oil reserves supported that conclusion. Because the disputed income arose from activity that served an operational function, Oregon could apportion that income.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the defendant argued that the forfeiture order arose out of a &quot;special statutory proceeding&quot; and was therefore appealable under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19.205(4). The court reversed and remanded. Although the trial court's forfeiture order was issued during, and had the same case number as, defendant's prosecution on charges of animal neglect, the forfeiture order was based on a different statute, which was did not make the forfeiture contingent on the defendant being found guilty in the criminal case. The court held that despite a shared case name and number, the forfeiture proceeding was sufficiently separate and distinct from the criminal action to qualify as a special statutory proceeding. As a result, because the forfeiture order arose out of a special statutory proceeding, it was appealable under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19.205(4).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In 1986, the city and county cosponsored the establishment of an enterprise zone, but in 1997 the city and county decided not to seek renewal of the zone.

The corporation filed a complaint in the tax court, seeking, among other things, a declaration that the public benefit contribution requirement violated &sect; 285.577(4).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's sole assignment of error was that the trial court erred in excluding a prospective juror. The trial judge excused this juror because the juror acknowledged that he was ineligible to serve by virtue of a provision of a then-recently-passed ballot initiative, which the instant court had declared unconstitutional after defendant's conviction. The State argued that defendant's conviction should be affirmed, because the trial judge's decision to exclude the juror in question was valid under recently enacted legislation, which required the trial court to do the same thing as the aforementioned ballot initiative. Defendant asserted that application of the new legislation to his case violated principles of fundamental fairness embodied in the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. The instant court concluded that defendant could not prevail on his legal theory because he raised it too late in the proceedings. Defendant did not make a timely challenge to the jury pool under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.005. The instant court also declined to address defendant's claim that removal of the juror in question offended his &quot;structural&quot; right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

The Oregon Court of Appeals reversed, and defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant contended that the arresting officer exceeded the permissible scope of the traffic stop that preceded defendant's arrest. The court of appeals held that 1997 Or. Laws ch. 313 (S.B. 936 (Or. 1996)), enacted after the trial court's decision, applied to the case and allowed admission of the evidence. S.B. 936 expanded the admissibility of relevant evidence in a criminal action. The supreme court reversed, holding first that S.B. 936 embraced only a single subject and matters properly connected therewith, and did not exceed the scope of its title, thereby complying with Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 20. However, the part of the law on which the State relied could not be applied retroactively to defendant's case. The provisions affecting the rules of evidence violated the restriction against ex post facto laws under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The legislature clearly intended that the act apply retrospectively, depriving a criminal defendant of a right to have evidence suppressed under certain conditions.</SPAN></P>

After his claim was denied, employee filed a negligence action against his employer, but the trial court dismissed that action, reasoning that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.018 (1995) made Oregon's Workers' Compensation Law the exclusive remedy for work-related injuries. The state supreme court held that the &sect; 656.018 violated the remedies clause of the Oregon Constitution because, by making the Workers' Compensation Law the exclusive remedy for work-related injuries and imposing a requirement on employee to establish that injuries sustained at work were the major contributing cause of his condition , &sect; 656.018 abrogated employee's common-law right to sue employer for negligence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed respondent's motion, and the appellate court reversed the trial court. On further review, the supreme court affirmed the appellate court and reversed the trial court. Section 107.108(1) provided for disparate treatment based upon one's marital status. Accordingly, the legislative classification was based upon personal characteristics that were not immutable, such that the classification survived scrutiny under art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The company had three billboards, none of which were in compliance with the OMIA. The State removed one billboard from which the company had removed all language, and the company requested administrative hearings as to the others. After losing at one hearing, the company removed language from the second sign. The summary judgment for the State was correct. The pleadings did not indicate that the claim for conversion rested on the alleged unconstitutionality of OMIA, and the issue on appeal was inadequately briefed. Under OMIA, rendering the sign blank did not constitute compliance, and the State could remove the noncomplying sign without waiting six months. The company's estoppel argument, based on alleged statements by a State employee, was also not adequately developed. The claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 failed because the company did not plead or argued that the state's application of OMIA caused it money damages. Because law regarding the right to free speech as affected by billboard regulation was not clearly established, the State was entitled to summary judgment based upon qualified immunity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">This case arose from defendant's sale of a used motor vehicle to plaintiff. The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff and awarded $ 11,496 in compensatory damages and $ 1 million in punitive damages. The trial court reduced the punitive damages award to $ 50,000, but the appellate court directed the trial court to grant defendant's motion for new trial unless plaintiff filed a remittitur of punitive damages in the amount of $ 300,000. Defendant challenged the jury's $ 1 million punitive damages award as excessive. The primary issue on review was the appropriate standard for post-verdict judicial review of a punitive damages award. The Oregon Supreme Court held that the jury's $ 1 million award of punitive damages was within the range that a rationale juror would have been entitled to award; it concluded that plaintiff established that defendant's misconduct was part of its day-to-day business dealings and was not limited to the sale of the vehicle to plaintiff and that defendant's conduct was highly reprehensible.

He moved to suppress the evidence. The trial court granted the motion, but the court of appeals reversed. However, the Oregon Supreme Court reversed. Comments made by defendant during a telephone call from his home, while the informant was present, were a wire communication pursuant to Ore. Rev. Stat. &sect; 165.535(4). Neither the informant or the listening officer was a participant in defendant's telecommunication. Neither defendant or the other participant in the call consented to the state's obtaining defendant's statements during the call by the body wire device. Defendant's conversations with his mother in the home and a juvenile outside the home were also protected. The state did not satisfy Ore. Rev. Stat. &sect; 165.540(5)(a)(B) because the listening officer did not share reciprocally in the communication as a participant jointly engaged in conversation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant received automatic and direct review of his convictions for three counts of aggravated murder, one count of attempted aggravated murder, one count of attempted murder, one count of assault in the first degree with a firearm, one count of robbery in the first degree, and one count of felon in possession of a firearm, and sentence of death imposed by the Multnomah County Circuit Court (Oregon).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">An altercation between defendant and an acquaintance rapidly escalated into a melee that included an attempted car-jacking, two shoot-outs between defendant and security officers, and resulted in the death of one officer, defendant's conviction for three counts of aggravated murder, and a sentence of death. On automatic appeal, the court reversed on two of the murder counts and otherwise affirmed. The trial court's aggravated murder instructions concerning robbery and kidnapping and killing to conceal identity were erroneous because they neither limited the jury's consideration to a specified underlying felony nor required jury unanimity concerning a choice among alternative felonies, as Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.095 required. Neither the sufficiency of the evidence nor the prosecutor's closing argument were a legally sufficient substitute for the necessary instructions. As the jury's unanimous conviction of defendant for one attempted murder provided the predicate for his conviction related to concealing identity, that jury instruction error was harmless. Juror selection had been proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Aggravated murder convictions on two counts were reversed, the case remanded, and all else was affirmed. Instructions that neither limited jury consideration to a specified underlying felony to aggravated murder counts, nor required unanimity concerning a choice among alternative felonies, were erroneous and cured by neither evidence nor closing arguments. That error was harmless in regard to one count. Defendant waived his right to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">State of Oregon sought review of Oregon court of appeals ruling that defendant was entitled to a new trial because a jury instruction that advised jurors of the consequences of a guilty except for insanity verdict violated defendant's rights to a fair trial under Or. Const. art. I, amend. 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with murder and related crimes, and raised the affirmative defense of insanity. The trial court gave Or. Unif. Jury Instruction - Crim. 1122, which advised jurors that if they found defendant guilty except for insanity that defendant would have been placed in the custody of the Psychiatric Security Review Board, and the conditions on which defendant could have been released. The jury was instructed that it was not to consider what sentence the court might have imposed if defendant was found guilty. Defendant was convicted and appealed; the court of appeals reversed, ruling that the instruction violated defendant's right to a fair trial under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court reversed, holding that the Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 guarantee of the right to trial by an impartial jury meant trial in an unbiased venue, not a trial that was fair in all respects. The instruction had no tendency to deprive defendant of trial by an impartial jury. However, U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV did guarantee defendant a fair trial, and the case was remanded for consideration of whether the instruction violated those federal constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Decision reversed, because guarantee of an impartial jury did not equate to right to a fair trial that would bar use of the challenged jury instruction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to death. One state witness was an inmate who gained information from defendant while incarcerated. Because the inmate gathered the information and provided it to police without direction from the state, the inmate was not an agent of the state, and the information was admissible. The inmate's failure to identify defendant at trial was not cause to suppress his testimony, but rather went to the jury's determination of the inmate's credibility as a witness. The prosecution's reference to the victim during closing argument did not deny defendant his right to confront witnesses. Prosecution's statements during the penalty phase of the trial regarding defendant's history of failure to take responsibility for his actions was relevant to the propensity for future dangerousness of defendant and did not constitute a comment regarding defendant's failure to testify at trial. Prosecution was permitted to present argument in support of a death sentence. Therefore, defendant's conviction and sentence of death were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 260.715(9) when he posted on online advertisement stating that he would give $20 to a person who would bring the person's official ballot to defendant, let defendant complete it, then sign the person's own name and submit the ballot to an elections volunteer; a person &quot;offers to purchase any official ballot,&quot; for purposes of &sect; 260.715(9), if the person communicates a message that objectively would be understood as proposing to purchase the right to use another person's ballot; [2]-The statutory prohibition on making an offer to purchase a ballot is facially unconstitutional because, by its terms, it criminalizes expression and is not wholly contained within a well-established historical exception to the protections of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8; defendant's demurrer to a charge of violating that statute should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 181A.820(1) failed as a matter of law because the legislature's intention was not to create a statutory tort for violation of the duty imposed by the statute; the legislature's intention was to reduce the potential liability of law enforcement agencies under existing law by expressly prohibiting problematic activities, and not to create additional liability through creation of a new statutory tort.</SPAN></P>
