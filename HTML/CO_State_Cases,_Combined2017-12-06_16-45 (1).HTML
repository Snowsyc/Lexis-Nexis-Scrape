<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Boulder County District Court, Colorado, entered a determination that half of a trust would be distributed to appellant wife so long as her father predeceased her. The supreme court granted certiorari. On remand, the trial court conducted hearings. The trial court issued revised permanent orders. The wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the wife's mother died, the master trust was divided into Trust A, in which wife had only an expectancy interest, and Trust B, the corpus of which consisted solely of the parents' home. The trial court concluded that wife's vested remainder interest in Trust B constituted property. On appeal, the wife first contended the trial court erred as a matter of law by failing to apply Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-10-113(7)(b) (2003) in calculating the marital appreciation of her interest in the trust. She maintained that, under the mandatory statutory language, her interest in the trust could not be classified as property until the trust became irrevocable after her mother's death. The appellate court agreed. The supreme court's mandate remanded the case to the trial court for reconsideration of the division of marital property, and it reiterated its earlier rule: a beneficiary's interest in a discretionary trust was not property, but merely an expectancy, as one's enforceable contractual right gave rise to a property interest, while an unenforceable interest constituted a mere expectancy. The appellate court further concluded &sect; 14-10-113(7)(b) was not unconstitutionally retrospective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment; the matter was a matter for further consideration.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed, finding that the drug transaction began in Denver. Although Denver police officers were acting outside of their statutory authority under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-3-106 when they arrested defendant in Adams County, an arrest in violation of the statute did not mandate suppression of evidence obtained therefrom, unless the statutory violation was either willful or so egregious as to violate defendant's constitutional rights. The detective did not travel to Adams County of his own volition, but was directed by codefendant. Defendant's constitutional rights were not violated simply because he was arrested without an arrest warrant. The drug transaction took place in the presence of the detective, which validated the warrantless arrest. The money found on defendant was admitted as relevant, as the trial court made the assertion that defendant was engaged in drug distribution and dealing more probable. Defendant's cross-examination of codefendant provided the jury with more than enough information to form an opinion as to codefendant's credibility and alleged bias.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant employee sought workers' compensation. The Colorado Industrial Claim Appeals Office (Panel) entered final orders, assessing penalties against respondent employer. The parties cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured during the scope and course of employment. At issue was the employer's failure to pay a bill incurred for a physician. A hearing was vacated based on the parties' agreement for payment of outstanding bills. The employer, however, neglected to pay the bill after the settlement agreement was reached. The administrative law judge (ALJ) adopted the conclusion that the ambiguous settlement agreement should be construed against employer, as the drafter. The ALJ further determined that the agreement did not clearly bar the assessment of penalties. On appeal, the employee challenged the retention of a percentage of the penalties by the state. The appellate court disagreed with the employee that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-304(1) was an unconstitutional taking. There was no dispute that &sect; 8-43-304(1) imposed a penalty on the employer. The employee's share of the penalty imposed on the employer could be reduced without effecting a taking. As to the construction of the settlement agreement, the appellate court concluded that the agreement was ambiguous. The Panel should have remanded the matter for further evidence before it construed the ambiguity against the employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's motion to dismiss was denied. The Panel's orders were set aside, and the matter was remanded for the further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Arapahoe County District Court (Colorado) of two counts of second degree kidnapping, one count of aggravated robbery, and one count of theft. The court vacated the sentences for the kidnapping convictions. Both kidnapping convictions were reduced to class four felonies. The court denied the remainder of defendant's postconviction motion. The State appealed and defendant cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by vacating the sentences for second degree kidnapping after concluding that the instructions and verdict forms did not adequately instruct the jury that the sentencing enhancers must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The court of appeals agreed. Although the instructions and verdict form did not adequately inform the jury that it must find the enhancement factors beyond a reasonable doubt, there was no plain error. The elements of robbery were completely subsumed in the aggravated robbery instruction, and the jury was instructed that it must find defendant guilty of aggravated robbery beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court concluded that the evidence of defendant's guilt was not overwhelming, but it stated, &quot;defendant did not dispute that the robbery occurred. He insisted that he was not the perpetrator.&quot; There was no dispute that the robbery occurred and there was no reasonable possibility that the jury could have failed to find that the manager trainee was the victim of a robbery. Consequently, defendant's sentence for the second degree kidnapping of the manager trainee was properly enhanced to a class two felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed to the extent it reduced the felony level and sentences for the two second degree kidnapping counts, and the case was remanded for correction of the mittimus to reinstate defendant's original conviction and sentence on those counts. The remainder of the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Adams County District Court (Colorado), which convicted him of second-degree sexual assault and sentenced him to an indeterminate prison sentence of five years to life and parole period of 10 years to life under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V)(C.5) (2003). Defendant was sentenced as a sex offender under the Colorado Sex Offender Lifetime Supervision Act of 1998, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-1001 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, claiming the victim's testimony was inconsistent. The court noted that inconsistencies went to the victim's credibility and the weight of the evidence but did not require rejection of it as a matter of law. The court found that a detective testified that sexual assault victims often had memory problems and that the victim was very consistent about the actual assaults. The court held that the evidence of defendant's yelling, threats toward the victim's daughter, his size and control of the victim, including holding her down and urinating on her, while she objected, supported the jury's conclusion that he caused her to submit against her will by means other than physical force. The court rejected defendant's cruel and unusual punishment claim and his argument that strict scrutiny analysis was required because the Sex Offender Lifetime Supervision Act was essentially a civil commitment statute designed to address future dangerousness, not past conduct. The court held that the rational basis test applied and the Act's emphasis on treatment and supervision served the legitimate governmental purpose of safety and incarceration costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment that convicted and sentenced defendant as a sex offender for second-degree sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the City and County of Denver District Court (Colorado), which convicted him of sexual assault on a child and sexual assault on a child as part of a pattern of sexual abuse. He was further adjudicated as an habitual sex offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, a boy who had been in State custody much of his life, revealed during therapy that defendant sexually abused him. Defendant was subsequently convicted of sexual assault on a child and sexual assault on a child as part of a pattern of sexual abuse. On appeal the court affirmed the conviction, stating that acceptance of defendant's interpretation that similar evidence of sexual intercourse included evidence of a victim's prior sexual conduct would defeat the purpose of the rape shield statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-407(1) (2003). Further, evidence regarding defendant's threatening and harassing behavior toward the victim's treatment providers was admissible as res gestae. The court agreed with defendant's contention that he was improperly sentenced under the Colorado Sex Offender Lifetime Supervision Act (Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-1002, because the jury's verdict could have been based on a predicate act of sexual assault that preceded the Act's November 1, 1998 enactment date. Further, the extraordinary risk of harm enhancement pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(10)(a) (2003) was improperly applied to his sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's wife was arrested for shoplifting cold medicine. She informed police that she and defendant exchanged an extraction from the medicine for methamphetamine. Defendant was charged with intent to manufacture a schedule II controlled substance. Defendant challenged his jury conviction by arguing the relevant statutory definition of &quot;controlled substance analog&quot; in the Act was unconstitutionally vague and was improperly applied to him. Defendant also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, the appropriateness of a jury instruction, and the failure to disqualify a juror. The court found that the Act's definition of a criminal substance analog was not impermissibly vague, which was in line with the reasoning from other jurisdictions and the federal courts. The court also found that the Act was not impermissibly applied, because notice existed that defendant's conduct was illegal before and after passage of amendments to the Act. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant possessed a controlled substance when he possessed the medicine, the jury instructions described the applicable law, and the evidence did not show any of the jurors were biased.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During undercover operations, the police and a confidential informant made controlled purchases of various quantities of cocaine from defendant. Police obtained a search warrant and made a no-knock entry. During execution of the warrant, police shot defendant as he reached for a gun. Two more warrants were later executed. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the jury to replay audiotapes of one of the controlled buys that were admitted into evidence. The appellate court disagreed. Defendant next contended that the affidavit supporting the warrant demonstrated a lack of probable cause, and the warrant was stale. Because the affidavit described an ongoing drug trafficking operation, the affidavit established probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant. As to whether the warrant was stale, the affidavit was dated the same day as the last controlled purchase and alleged a continuing activity of selling drugs. The delay in executing the warrant did not render the warrant stale or the resulting search unconstitutional. Use of the no-knock warrant was constitutional, given the exigent circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the jury should have been instructed that it was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew he had been convicted of a felony at the time of his escape. The appellate court determined that, in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-208 and the jury instruction tracking the statute, the mental state &quot;knowingly&quot; appeared after the &quot;following a conviction of a felony&quot; element and before the &quot;escapes from said custody or confinement&quot; element. Such placement was indicative of the legislature's intent that the mental state &quot;knowingly&quot; apply only to the conduct element of the crime of escape following conviction. Evidence of the fact of a prior conviction was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for escape following felony confinement. The prior conviction exception permitted the trial court to make findings regarding prior convictions. There was no right to a jury trial in habitual criminal proceedings. The identification by the detective that defendant was the person convicted and sentenced in the three cases and the authenticate documents provided were sufficient to support the finding that defendant had previously been convicted of three felonies.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the award of joint parenting responsibilities, but vacated the order prohibiting appellant from exposing the child to &quot;homophobic&quot; religious teachings and remanded for findings required by Colo.

On appeal, she argued that by enacting the specific offense of defrauding an innkeeper, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;12-44-102 (2003), the general assembly abrogated the prosecutor's discretion to charge her with theft under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;18-4-401(1) (2003). By enacting Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-44-102, the general assembly did not intend to preclude prosecution for theft. The appellate court also rejected defendant's contention that her right to equal protection was violated because defrauding an innkeeper and theft punished identical conduct, but defrauding an innkeeper carried a lesser penalty. The crimes of theft and defrauding an innkeeper comprised different elements, and the punishment prescribed was different for each crime. Defrauding an innkeeper required intent to defraud, whereas theft required intent to permanently deprive a person of a thing of value. The evidence showed defendant intended to permanently deprive the hotel of compensation for the room she occupied. The record supported the theory that defendant procured her stay through deception, and that theory alone was sufficient to uphold her conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sustained an admitted injury. The employer began paying 55 percent of the claimant's benefits to the Colorado Family Support Registry (CFSR) pursuant to an administrative lien and attachment authorized by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-124(6) (2003). The claimant argued his benefits had been improperly reduced to satisfy child support arrearages. The appellate court held that it was erroneous to characterize the amendment to &sect; 8-42-124(6) as substantive legislation which applied only to injuries suffered after May 31, 2001. Because the amendment did not specify an effective date, it was effective upon enactment and had to be applied immediately. The claimant did not have a vested right to receive benefits directly, and the child support attachment liens applied to benefits for injuries that occurred before the effective date of the statutory amendment. The claimant's right to receive the same amount of benefits was not impaired, even though 55 percent was sent directly to CFSR pursuant to the child support attachment lien. The application of the amendment to &sect; 8-42-124(b) did not violate the constitutional prohibition against retrospective legislation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant waited nine years from the date his conviction became final to file his collateral attack challenging its validity, six years beyond the statutory deadline in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402(1). Accordingly, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss the habitual criminal count. Defendant next contended that there was insufficient evidence to support his POWPO conviction. Contrary to defendant's assertion, the fact that he was not convicted of the menacing charge did not preclude a POWPO conviction. Although both charges arose from events that occurred on the same day, the charges had different elements of proof, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-12-108 (2003) (POWPO); and Colo. Rev.

Further, the court stated that, in the context of zoning regulations, it found no Colorado appellate opinions that interpreted the state constitution to provide greater protection than the federal constitution. The company also received full and complete judicial review. The court also rejected the company's contention that Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of third-degree assault, a violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-204 (2003). The victim testified that defendant, her common law husband, pushed her and struck her with a gun. The victim suffered bruising on her arms and leg and a gash to her head that required stitches. The Weld County District Court (Colorado) ordered domestic violence treatment as a condition of defendant's probation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that the trial court erred by excluding evidence of his peaceful nature and his lack of a criminal record. The appellate court disagreed. Defendant attempted to establish, through his own testimony and through cross-examination of the victim, that he had never been convicted of a criminal offense. The trial court concluded that that evidence was not relevant and refused to admit it. Evidence showing defendant had never been convicted of an offense was not evidence of a &quot;pertinent trait&quot; under Colo. R. Evid. 404(a)(1). Thus, the absence of a criminal conviction did not necessarily demonstrate defendant's law-abiding character. Further, nonoccurrence evidence was improper under Colo. R. Evid. 405, because it was not in the form of an opinion and it did not describe a specific instance of conduct. Thus, the trial court acted within its discretion. Accordingly, the appellate court also rejected defendant's related claims that the trial court's ruling violated his rights to due process, to effective assistance of counsel, or to testify in his own behalf. The appellate court also held that the third-degree assault statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>

Although the deputies had probable cause to arrest defendant, because they lacked a warrant and neither exigent circumstances nor a need to render emergency aid existed, they could not enter his residence without consent. Neither defendant nor his mother consented to entry. Thus, defendant's initial decision to remain within his residence, despite the threat to obtain a warrant, was protected by U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court was not persuaded by the trial court's observation that defendant was avoiding arrest, which could be evidence of consciousness of guilt. Defendant provided identification to the police officers and he made no attempt surreptitiously to leave the home after that initial contact. Accordingly, the court the trial court abused its discretion in allowing testimony of defendant's refusal to come out of the house and submit to arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of possession of a schedule II controlled substance, a class four felony. He was sentenced to stipulated six-year terms in the Department of Corrections (DOC) on each count, to be served concurrently with each other and with a sentence in another case, plus three years of mandatory parole as required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V)(A) (2003). He was paroled; however, his parole was revoked and he was returned to DOC to serve the remainder of his mandatory parole term. He filed a pro se Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(a) and (c) motion for postconviction relief, arguing his parole had been unlawfully revoked and that requiring him to serve a mandatory parole term violated his right to equal protection. The trial court denied the motion, concluding it did not have jurisdiction to address the parole revocation and rejecting his equal protection claim. The appellate court concluded the sentencing scheme was not arbitrary; therefore, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V) violated neither equal protection nor due process of law. However, the trial court erred in rejecting, on jurisdictional grounds, his claim that his parole was unlawfully revoked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant went to a shopping center almost daily and spent several hours witting on benches near, and circling, a kiosk that was the victim's place of employment. The victim felt threatened by defendant's presence and he was soon arrested for a parole violation arising out of a pervious harassment by stalking conviction. He was convicted of two counts of felony harassment by stalking and one count of misdemeanor harassment. He challenged the 1999 conviction, asserting that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in the prior case. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial, stating that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the 1999 conviction and instructing the jury that it was an element of harassment by stalking, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-111(4)(b)(I), (III) (2003). Because the sentence enhancer was a prior conviction and the statute did not prescribe a burden of proof, the prosecution was only required to prove the prior conviction by a preponderance of the evidence, and it could have been properly determined by the trial court sitting without a jury. Further, the statute was neither vague nor overbroad.</SPAN></P>

NARF requested declaratory relief that both ordinances were invalid and that the resulting historic district was therefore invalid or that NARF's properties be excluded from the district. The district court denied the requests for relief. The court reversed, concluding that Boulder, Colo. Ordinance 7038, &sect; 8 was invalid because it allowed defendants to enter into privately negotiated contracts with individual property owners and bypass all the substantive and procedural due process requirements of the Boulder Municipal Code. It allowed for no quasi-judicial proceedings whatsoever with respect to alteration, removal, or demolition and did not require that the alteration or demolition meet the specific standards outlined in Boulder, Colo. Mun. Code &sect; 10-13-18 (1981). Boulder, Colo. Ordinance 7103 was also invalid because it was passed pursuant to Boulder, Colo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Colorado Podiatry Board (the board), revoked appellant podiatrist's license to practice podiatry. The podiatrist appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The podiatrist was charged with multiple violations of the Colorado Podiatry Practice act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-32-101, et seq. (2003) (the act). The administrative law judge (ALJ) found the charged counts had been proved, and imposed a sanction of a one-year license suspension followed by a two-year period of probation. The board rejected the ALJ's proposed sanction and voted to revoke the podiatrist's license. On appeal, the podiatrist raised various challenges to the board's determination. It was within the board's authority to determine that the procedures performed by the podiatrist were outside the permissible scope of podiatric practice under the act and to impose the sanction of license revocation. The ALJ's findings of evidentiary fact were not contrary to the weight of the evidence and thus were binding on review. Because the board's decision to substitute its judgment for that of the ALJ with respect to the sanction and the ultimate fact of the podiatrist's violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-32-107(3)(t) had a reasonable basis in law and was supported by substantial evidence in the record, the appellate court could not set aside that determination.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 35-38-101 et seq. (2003). The manufacturer challenged the amount of attorney fees awarded. The manufacturer sought attorney fees on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer and the retailer entered into a written distributor agreement for the sale of vacuum systems that were used to vacuum slurry from newly dug trenches. Although the parties did not formally renew or extend the agreement in writing at the end of the one-year term, the retailer continued to purchase units from the manufacturer for an additional two years and eight months. The retailer later informed the manufacturer that it was terminating their distributorship agreement. The retailer requested that the manufacturer repurchase four units remaining in the retailer's inventory. When the manufacturer refused, the retailer sued. The trial court granted the manufacturer's motion for dismissal. On appeal, the court found that the agreement between the parties had terminated before the retailer ordered the additional units at issue. The Act's repurchase provision did not apply to the additional units. The court further found that the repurchase provision was inapplicable to one unit because the retailer had leased it to a contracting company. Finally, the court found that the trial court did not err in awarding attorney fees to the manufacturer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the action. The court remanded the case for an award of the manufacturer's attorney fees incurred on appeal and for consideration and determination of the manufacturer's additional attorney fee request made in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the El Paso County District Court (Colorado), which, after a jury trial, convicted defendant of attempted first degree murder, attempted first degree assault, first degree burglary, conspiracy to commit first degree burglary, possession of burglary tools, second degree burglary of a dwelling, aggravated motor vehicle theft, theft, crime of violence, weapon possession by an offender, and being a habitual criminal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and others committed multiple burglaries and car thefts. In one burglary, defendant shot and wounded a victim. Although the jury instructions on the elements of attempted first degree murder and attempted first degree assault failed to describe the required mens rea, the court found no error because the instructions, when considered with other instructions, adequately informed the jury regarding mens rea. The court found no error in the instructions regarding first and second degree burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary, theft, and aggregate theft. Attempted first degree assault was not a lesser included offense of attempted first degree murder. The first degree aggravated motor vehicle theft counts were constructively amended to defendant's prejudice because an uncharged crime was added; hence, reversal was necessary under Colo. R. Crim. P. 7(e). Because accomplice testimony was corroborated, the trial court did not err in refusing accomplice testimony instructions. The prosecutor did not improperly direct the jury's attention to defendant's silence. A police sergeant's opinion testimony was admissible under Colo. R. Evid. 701. Leading questions were not improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's convictions of first degree aggravated motor vehicle theft and remanded with directions to enter judgments of not guilty as to those offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker's hearing application did not identify any disputed issues for determination. Instead, she maintained that all issues remained open. The worker argued that, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-203(2)(b)(II), her objection kept her case open until she identified a dispute that was ripe for hearing. The appellate court ruled that neither Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-203(2)(b)(II) nor any other provision allowed a claimant to file an objection to a Final Admission of Liability (FAL) without identifying a contested issue or that issues admitted in an FAL remained open indefinitely until the claimant identified a disputed issue and requested a hearing. The issues of PPD and disfigurement were closed, subject to the reopening provisions. The legitimate state goals of relieving injured workers from the adverse economic effects of disabling work-related injuries and reducing costs were furthered by Colo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from orders of the El Paso County District Court (Colorado) that denied his motions for postconviction relief, and the court of appeals also considered an order that granted reconsideration of the denial of defendant's Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(b) motion. Defendant claimed he received ineffective assistance of counsel and was not properly advised by the court, and thus should have been granted post-trial relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust and to theft in two different cases, and remaining charges against him were dismissed. The trial court sentenced him to a 12-year prison term and a concurrent three-year term. The court of appeals first found that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain his motions to reconsider the Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(b) motion, because it amounted to the filing of an impermissible second Rule 35(b) motion and, because the motions were filed after the 120-day deadline for filing such motions, they were untimely. Defendant next argued that he was not advised about the sentencing consequences of his guilty plea to the sex assault charge and that the trial court erred by denying his Rule 35(c) motion to withdraw his guilty plea on that basis. The court of appeals noted that, although the court had not fully advised defendant orally or in writing, the prosecutor had advised him of the potential range of sentences on the record. Defendant's counsel had in fact minimized defendant's potential liability by obtaining the dismissal of a number of charges, and he was not prejudiced by the representation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting reconsideration of the denial of his Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with burglary and third degree sexual assault, which resulted from a 1993 incident. Defendant agreed to plead guilty to the burglary charge in exchange for the dismissal of the sexual assault charge and a two-year deferred judgment with a sentence to probation. In 2000, defendant's probation was revoked and he was sentenced to a six-year term plus mandatory parole under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V)(A) (2003). The trial court found that, because defendant did not plead guilty to a sexual offense, he was required to serve a mandatory parole term. The appellate court agreed with defendant's contention that the parole portion of his sentence was illegal, because he was effectively sentenced for a conviction of an offense with a factual basis involving unlawful sexual behavior, and, therefore, he was subject to discretionary parole, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-2-201(5)(a) (2003), rather than the mandatory parole period provided in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V)(A).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court rejected defendant's insanity defendant and he was subsequently found guilty of first-degree murder after he repeatedly stabbed and killed his father. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial, stating that the trial court erred when it permitted evidence obtained from his court-ordered examination to be used to prove his guilt. Essentially, his due process rights and privilege against self-incrimination were violated when portions of the psychiatrist's testimony were improperly admitted and used. The recited evidence impermissibly related to defendant's guilt of the substantive offense. Some of that evidence, such as defendant's own communications to the psychiatrist and the psychological testing, was acquired for the first time during the court-ordered examination and thus was admissible at trial only as to insanity issues pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-107(1.5)(a) (2003). Because the psychiatrist's statements related to defendant's culpability, and were not limited to his capacity to form the mental state at issue, they were erroneously admitted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife contested the property division on appeal of her marital dissolution. The appellate court held as follows. The marital appreciation of the wife's irrevocable trust interest was part of the marital estate pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-10-113(4) (2003). However, the wife's remainder interest in her grandfather's irrevocable trust was a gift, vested long before her marriage to the husband, and was, therefore, separate property. The trial court had discretion to use the subtraction method here to value the trust, rather than the time-rule formula. The husband's car was his separate property, because the $ 10,000 down payment came from the sale of a vehicle he owned prior to the marriage. The furniture in the marital residence was marital property, because it was a gift made to both parties as a contribution to the marital estate. The equal division of the marital property was equitable, in light of the parties' respective financial circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment on all claims except the mobile home park's exemption claim. After the mobile home park amended it complaint, the trial court granted summary judgment on all claims. The mobile home park appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mobile home park was in operation since 1955. To address fire safety problems, the city amended its city code to establish new spacing requirements. Homes installed before 1997 were exempted from the new code. Before filing its complaint, the mobile home park did not seek a variance. The appellate court rejected the mobile home park's contention that the trial court erred in dismissing its exemption claim for its failure to exhaust administrative remedies by not having requested a variance. The appellate court concluded that the pursuit of a variance would not have been a futile act. The mobile home park also contended that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The appellate court rejected the argument that the ordinance constituted a taking, and was vague in violation of due process. The code did not foreclose the owner from operating the mobile home park. The application of the code was a reasonable exercise of police power. Further, the amended code did not require compliance with the new spacing requirements until 2007. Finally, the new requirements do not require the owners of mobile home parks to guess at a method of compliance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged for sexually assaulting his eight-year-old daughter. Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty in the sex assault case to one count of sexual assault on a child, a class four felony, and in a robbery case to one count of conspiracy to commit robbery, a class five felony. He also pleaded guilty to an unrelated misdemeanor count. The plea agreement provided that sentencing would be open to the trial court. The court of appeals reviewed the trial court's sentencing decisions and found no error. In the sex assault case, defendant's eight-year sentence was within the presumptive range set forth in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V)(A). Defendant's six-year aggravated range sentence in the robbery case was justified, because defendant was on bond for the sexual assault when he committed the robbery. He was entitled to discretionary parole.</SPAN></P>

As corrected, the orders were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of theft by receiving and two counts of unlawful distribution, manufacturing, dispensing, sale, and possession of marihuana and marihuana concentrate and admitted that he was subject to enhanced sentencing as a special offender. The Las Animas County District Court (Colorado) ordered the sentences to be served consecutively and denied defendant's Colo. R. Crim. P. 35 motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that his theft by receiving conviction had to be vacated because the charge was filed after the statute of limitations had expired. Although the general assembly did not specifically define theft by receiving as a continuing offense as it had defined some other crimes, the Court of Appeals of Colorado, Division Five held that the nature of the offense of theft by receiving was such that the assembly must have intended it to have been a continuing course of conduct when the charge was based on defendant's retention of stolen property. Because theft by receiving based on defendant's retention of stolen property was a continuing offense, the statute of limitations did not begin to run until defendant no longer possessed the property. As the stolen property was seized from defendant four days before the charge was filed, the trial court correctly rejected that claim. Defendant's sentences, a six-year prison term for the theft by receiving conviction and a 12-year term for each of the drug-related convictions were not excessive, but were on the low end of the presumptive range provided by the special offender statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V)(A).</SPAN></P>

House Rule 25(j)(1)(G) to kill a proposed bill without prior committee consideration on the merits of the bill violated Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 20. The City and County of Denver District Court, Colorado, granted defendant general assembly's motion to dismiss. The Minority Leader appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the minority leader contended the trial court erred in dismissing his suit. Contrary to the general assembly's arguments, the appellate court found that the minority leader had standing, that although the legislative session had ended, the exceptions to the mootness doctrine applied, and that interpretation of the constitution and Colo. House Rule 25(j)(1)(G) did not infringe on the powers and duties of the legislature. The appellate court also held that the language &quot;consideration on the merits&quot; in the GAVEL (Give A Vote to Every Legislator) amendment contemplated, at a minimum, some interactive consideration by members of a committee and that each measure had to be so considered before being voted on by the committee on its merits; the House Rule, on its face, complied with the GAVEL amendment to Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 20. However, the appellate court agreed with the minority leader that his complaint adequately alleged a claim for declaratory relief that the general assembly's alleged actions with respect to the house bill in question in forcing a vote on the supermotion without prior committee consideration on the merits violated &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment granting the motion to dismiss was affirmed insofar as the complaint concerned the two bills not sponsored by minority leader.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon dissolution of his marriage, the father was ordered to pay child support, pursuant to the guidelines set forth in &sect; 14-10-115. The court held that the rational basis test applied to the evaluation of the father's constitutional challenges. A parent had no privacy interest in the process by which child support obligations were determined because support levels were not purely private determinations. Furthermore, the guidelines did not infringe upon a fundamental right, nor did they discriminate against a suspect class or significantly interfere with a fundamental right. The State had a legitimate interest in requiring divorced or separated parents to provide child support based on the parties' combined gross incomes. Even if a divorced or separated parent were treated disparately by the imposition of a child support obligation, the distinction did not violate such parent's right to equal protection because it was rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Because it approximated the amount of parental income that the child would have received in an intact family, application of the guidelines was also not arbitrary, capricious, fundamentally unfair, or coercive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties owned adjoining properties. They agreed that the neighbors could use a portion of the land as an access road for three years. When the neighbors continued to use the land after the three year period, the owner filed an action for breach of contract and trespass. The neighbors contended that the had a prescriptive easement. After the trial court determined that the neighbors were permitted to use the land for the guide and outfitting business only, the owner sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the neighbors showed that they had a prescriptive easement under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-41-101 (2002) based on the historical use made of the road during any 18 year period prior to October 20, 1989. There was evidence that the land had been used for the same purpose by prior owners. Further, increased burden on the owner's servient estate was not so substantial as to require the trial court to limit the easement. The fact that the prior owners did not have a license to conduct such a business was irrelevant. Finally, the court found that the trial court properly set the width of the easement, and a relocation of the easement was not required.</SPAN></P>

However, the instant court agreed with the trial court that the effectiveness of the type of therapy on prior occasions was not relevant to the issue of whether defendant acted recklessly in conducting the rebirthing therapy at issue. The instant court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court's ruling violated her due process right to present a defense, as she was able to argue that her own response to the child's cries was not reckless. Also, defendant's argument that her sentence violated her right to equal protection was not jurisdictional; thus, because she did not raise it in the trial court, it was waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners purchased a large parcel of land. Later, they filed two development applications with the county. After the applications were denied, the owners filed an action in the trial court. They sought review after their motions for partial summary judgment were denied. In affirming, the court held that the county was permitted to regulate the use of land in order to protect wildlife under the Colorado Local Government Land Use Control Enabling Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-20-101 et seq. (2002), despite a zoned land exemption in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-65.1-107(1)(c)(II) of the Colorado Areas and Activities of State Interest Act (AASIA), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-65.1-101 et seq. (2002). The Enabling Act and the AASIA were interpreted separately. As such, the county was permitted to use the Enabling Act to prohibit development. Further, the owners did not establish that they relied on a zoning classification to their detriment or that they took substantial actions based on representations or affirmative actions by the county. In addition, Pitkin County, Colo., Land Use Code &sect; 3-80-080B was applied correctly. Finally, the court found that the issues related to takings were not ripe.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the fingerprint evidence, the police department number, and the circumstantial evidence demonstrated defendant was the same person convicted and sentenced in the two previous cases. Defendant argued that there was insufficient identification evidence to prove the habitual criminal counts, as the prosecution only offered fingerprint evidence that was attached to his arrest record, and it did not produce fingerprint cards associated with each prior conviction. The appellate court ruled that, despite the fact that fingerprint evidence was not attached to defendant's conviction record, it was satisfied that the evidence presented was sufficient to allow a reasonable fact finder to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the same person who had been convicted of the two previous felonies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defense counsel knew that defendant was an alien legally residing in the United States and informed the trial court that defendant lived here since 1977, when he was admitted to the United States from Vietnam under an amnesty program. The trial court responded that &quot;the guilty plea should have no effect then upon your status in the country.&quot; Nothing further was said concerning defendant's immigration status. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his Colo. R. Crim. P. 35 motion without a hearing. The appellate court found that, although defendant denominated his motion as a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, it read it as contending that his conviction was unconstitutionally obtained, because his guilty plea was not knowingly and intelligently made. The appellate court ruled that the trial court erred in not holding a hearing on defendant's claims, as questions had been raised concerning the validity of defendant's plea. If defendant entered his guilty plea under the mistaken assurance that his plea would not affect his status as a legal resident in the U.S., then his plea may not have been made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the La Plata County District Court (Colorado), which entered a judgment of conviction upon jury verdicts finding him guilty of attempted patronizing a prostituted child, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-7-406(1)(a) (2002), and attempted third degree sexual assault, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-404(1.5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence established that defendant held the 14-year-old victim against the window of a trolley and told her to take her pants off. This was sufficient evidence of intimidation taken as a substantial step toward inducing the victim to perform a sexual act to convict defendant of attempted patronizing a prostituted child. The court disagreed with the argument that there was an implied element that he had to attempt to have the victim act as a &quot;prostitute.&quot; It was also not plain error to instruct only that the &quot;act&quot; of patronizing a prostituted child had to be knowingly committed because the facts did not suggest that the coercion, threat, or intimidation was not knowingly done. The court reversed with respect to assault because it was a constructive amendment to the charge when the trial court instructed the jury based on the &quot;to engage in any sexual contact&quot; part of the statute rather than the &quot;to expose intimate parts&quot; section, under which defendant was charged. The trial court also erred in ordering an indeterminate sentence for attempted third-degree sexual assault pursuant to the former Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-803, recodified as Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-1004 (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of conviction of attempted third-degree sexual assault and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial on that charge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a passenger were driving on a State highway when they encountered road signs stating &quot;Narcotics Checkpoint, One Mile Ahead.&quot; In fact, there was no such checkpoint. Defendant stopped the vehicle, and the passenger threw something from the window. Officers in camouflage observed those acts and radioed ahead to another officer, who stopped the vehicle and ticketed the passenger for littering. The article thrown from the car was determined to be a marijuana pipe, and an unconsented to search of defendant's car resulted in his arrest for possession of more drugs. Defendant primarily argued that the road sign ruse violated his Fourth Amendment rights and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 7. The appellate court disagreed. No legitimate privacy interest was violated by the officers, whose testimony was credible, and whose subjective intent was irrelevant. The petty offense of littering gave the officers probable cause to detain the vehicle until the contraband was discovered. The arrest could be made based upon a communication from another officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a workers' compensation proceeding brought against respondent employer and respondent insurer, petitioner claimant sought review of an order of respondent Industrial Claim Appeals Office (Colorado) dismissing, for lack of a final order, the appeal of an order of the administrative law judge (ALJ) striking the claimant's request for a workers' compensation division-sponsored independent medical examination (DIME).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant argued that the ALJ's order was final, and therefore appealable, because he was denied benefits, including permanent disability benefits. The instant court disagreed with the claimant. The order, which determined that the claimant's DIME was not properly obtained, did not, on its face, grant or deny the claimant any penalty or benefits. The order did not prevent the claimant from requesting that the division expand the scope of the employer-requested DIME. Further, there had been no determination made that the impairment rating adopted by the physician in the first DIME was incorrect. The instant court also lacked lack authority to consider the claimant's assertion that the panel should have reviewed the ALJ's order, even if it was interlocutory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proceeding was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police obtained a &quot;knock and announce&quot; warrant, which they executed at the apartment.

On appeal, the People claimed that the trial court erred in reducing the mandatory sentence to 24 years. Defendant contended the appellate court lacked jurisdiction. The appellate court agreed with defendant. The People conceded that their notice of appeal was not timely, but they argued excusable neglect. The excusable neglect provision within the appellate rules, however, applied to appeals filed by defendants, and not to appeals by the state or the People. As to defendant's appeal, defendant alleged that the trial court erred in admitting certain documents that were found in his apartment. The appellate court agreed that the documents were not admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule, but it determined that this error was harmless. The appellate court also determined that defendant's convictions for possession of a controlled substance and possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance violated double jeopardy protections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court dismissed the People's appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Adams County District Court, Colorado, of harassment-stalking, two counts of violation of a restraining order, and one count of criminal solicitation. Defendant appealed, asserting that portions of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-111(4)(b)(III) (2002) were unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, and that the evidence regarding his behavior was insufficient to support his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant ignored the victim's requests to cease contacting her, the victim ultimately obtained a permanent restraining order against defendant. Defendant continued to contact the victim frequently by telephone, and sent her a letter indicating that he would continue to try to resume their relationship. Finally, defendant was arrested and charged with harassment-stalking and violation of a restraining order. Because the only uncertainty raised by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-111(4)(b)(III) (2002) was whether the conduct would cause a reasonable person serious emotional distress, and the determination of &quot;reasonableness&quot; was a question for the jury, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Secondly, defendant did not need to know that his conduct would cause a reasonable person serious emotional distress. Defendant's argument that his behavior was insufficient to result in serious emotional distress in a reasonable person was rejected. However, the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction of criminal solicitation to tamper with witness, as no evidence was presented to the jury that the victim had, in fact, been legally summoned to appear at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions of harassment-stalking and violation of a restraining order were affirmed. Defendant's conviction of criminal solicitation was vacated.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 18-3-305(1) (2002), a class four felony. The Adams County District Court, Colorado, rejected defendant's motion to refuse application of the Colorado Sex Offender Lifetime Supervision Act of 1998, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-1001 et seq., found extraordinary aggravating circumstances, and sentenced defendant to an indeterminate sentence of 12 years to life. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the Act violated his procedural and substantive due process rights. The appellate court ruled that defendant's procedural due process rights were not violated, as he was provided an opportunity to be heard on the sentence to be imposed. The Act did not violate defendant's right to substantive due process when no fundamental right was implicated and the legislation was subject to evaluation pursuant to the rational basis test, as the Act served the legitimate governmental interests of protecting the public from untreated sex offenders and of rehabilitating and treating those offenders. The appellate court found that, because defendant did not demonstrate that he was treated any differently from any other defendant convicted under similar circumstances, he lacked standing to raise an equal protection argument. Also, defendant's sentence was not disproportionate to the offense, and the Act did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. Furthermore, the sentence was consistent with defendant's plea bargain, his plea to enticement of a child, his admission of the underlying circumstances supporting his plea, and the sentences available under the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was injured in a work-related accident. One year after the compensable injury, the claimant was placed at maximum medical improvement and assigned a zero percent rating. The employer then filed a final admission of liability (FAL). Later, the claimant requested a DIME. The DIME physician assigned a 15 percent impairment rating. The employer contended that the notice and proposal to select a DIME was untimely under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-107.2 (2002). After the employer's motion to strike the DIME was affirmed on appeal, the claimant sought review. In affirming, the court determined that &sect; 8-42-107.2, as amended in 1999, provided that the claimant had 30 days to file a notice and proposal to select a DIME physician after the mailing of the FAL. The court held that the 30-day period in &sect; 8-42-107.2(6) began to run for the claimant on the effective date of the statute. The court noted that the claimant would not have had an opportunity to file a notice before then because the FAL was issued before &sect; 8-42-107.2(6) went into effect. However, the notice was still untimely because it was not filed within 30 days of September 1, 1999.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county filed a dependency and neglect petition against the mother due to her use of methamphetamines during her pregnancy. The mother argued that the unborn child was not a &quot;child&quot; within the meaning of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-1-103(18) (2002). After the trial court granted the motion to dismiss, the county sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the case was not moot, despite the fact that the mother had already given birth to the child. The case was capable of repetition yet evading review, and it involved a matter of great importance or recurring constitutional violation. The trial court had exclusive original jurisdiction over proceedings involving any child who was neglected or dependent. A &quot;child&quot; was defined as a person under 18 years of age in &sect; 19-1-103(18). The court determined that the general assembly's decision to exclude unborn children from the definition of &quot;child&quot; meant that &sect; 19-1-103(18) applied only to a child after birth. Moreover, there were no remedies appropriate for unborn children or designed to restrict the conduct of pregnant women. Therefore, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to a 10-year prison term. Defendant filed a motion for reconsideration and reduction of his sentence under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(b). The trial court stated that defendant's motion was untimely and successive to a previous motion, and it would not be appropriate to grant the relief requested. The appellate court noted that defendant did not appeal his sentence and he did not file his motion to reconsider and reduce sentence until more than two years after his sentence was imposed. Defendant's motion was outside the time limits of Rule 35(b). Under Colo. R. Crim. P. 45(b)(2), the trial court could not have extended the time for filing his motion based on his mother's problems and his lack of knowledge about the law. The imposition of an illegal sentence did not trigger the time for the filing of a Rule 35(b) motion. The illegal mandatory parole portion of defendant's sentence was distinct from the legal imprisonment term. The imprisonment portion was not void. The 120-day period for reducing the prison term expired before defendant filed his motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court, Twentieth Judicial District, Colorado, granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff business owner in his action against defendant, Board of County Commissioners, for damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and for review of a land use determination under Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(4). The county appealed; the owner cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the owner's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 due process claim. The appellate court found that the county officials were acting under the color of state law, and the county did not contest its liability for the acts of those officials. The owner had a protected interest in property within the meaning of the Due Process Clause because he paid for a permit and began his business. He had a legitimate claim of entitlement to that interpretation granting a use-by-right to so employ his property. Providing pre-deprivation notice and hearing would not be unduly burdensome for the county. The availability of post-deprivation process to the owner at most would affect the period for which the owner could recover damages and would not affect the county's liability for the lack of pre-deprivation process. The Board of Adjustment's changed interpretation of the owner's permit, issued without notice and an opportunity to be heard, was due no deference. Awarding prejudgment interest under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-101 was error because federal law determined whether interest should be awarded under a &sect; 1983 claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment awarding prejudgment interest was reversed and remanded, as the assessment of prejudgment interest had to be determined under federal, not state law; the balance of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to conspiracy to possess a schedule II controlled substance and was sentenced to a four-year term, plus a three-year period of mandatory parole. Appellant then sent a letter stating that he was no longer in agreement with the terms and conditions as modified by the parole agent, and appellant's parole was revoked. Appellant challenged the orders denying his postconviction motions, filed pursuant to Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c)(2)(VII), but the court affirmed. The court stated that inmates and parolees were not similarly situated, as their supervision was governed by distinct entities. Accordingly, the Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) court properly rejected appellant's equal protection claim. Further, the power of the judiciary was not implicated, as appellant's parole revocation re-incarceration did not constitute a new sentence. The court concluded the re-incarceration was not a new sentence and, therefore, provided no due process basis to limit the parole board's discretion to determine an appropriate penalty for a violation of mandatory parole, including the length of the period of re-incarceration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an executive order, the governor expressed his desire that the state department of personnel and general support services (GSS) discontinue automatically taking payroll deductions of any kind from employee paychecks unless the deductions were expressly authorized by statute, such as federal tax withholding, or were state-sponsored deductions available to all state employees. The GSS, in turn, instituted a payroll deduction policy that discontinued the practice of automatically deducting union dues from union members' paychecks and forwarding the dues directly to the unions. The public employee's unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of the policy on various grounds. The appellate court held there was no legally protected right to state-implemented payroll deductions, except for those deductions expressly authorized by statute or state-sponsored for all state employees; therefore, the public employees failed to show an injury to a legally protected right and lacked standing to pursue their claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed an action challenging amendments to the state's interstate and intrastate motor vehicle carrier registration fee and ownership tax statutes. While the taxpayer's appeal from the denial of class certification was pending, the supreme court decided that the amendments violated the Commerce Clause and remanded for consideration of whether to certify the class for the purpose of refunds. The trial court awarded common fund damages to two certified classes of interstate carriers. On review, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that certification under Colo. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) was superior to the state's deficient opt-in refund program or in restructuring the class. The court declined to deviate from the law of the case, the rejection of the state's Statute of Limitations argument. The state was not entitled to recover actual costs because the court affirmed the certification and the common fund, which was supported by sufficient evidence. The court held that the trial court correctly applied the constitutional cap on the taxpayer's attorney fees and refused to award prejudgment interest for each year the tax was assessed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of conviction entered on a jury verdict finding him guilty of one count of sexual assault on a child and one count of sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust. He also appealed the sentence imposed under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-1004 (2002) of the Colorado Sex Offender Lifetime Supervision Act (Act), after the trial court found him guilty of being a habitual sex offender. The court affirmed, stating that even though a prospective juror's childhood abuse constituted a possible source of bias, her responses to questioning showed no animosity or bias toward defendant. The admission of the victim's hearsay statements pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-25-129 (2002) was proper because the victim used age appropriate language, would have had no knowledge of the incident unless it occurred, and had made the statements while crying. The court stated that defendant's argument that the Act contained no provisions for review of the decisions of the Department of Corrections or of the parole board relating to a prisoner's release was improper because he was not currently eligible for parole; thus his argument was premature.</SPAN></P>

Defendant later pled guilty to two counts of forgery for which he was placed on probation for three years. Probation was revoked after defendant violated the conditions of probation, and he was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment to be followed by two years of mandatory parole. Defendant argued that his mandatory parole term violated his constitutional right to equal protection of the laws. He contended that the mandatory parole laws violated his right to equal protection because, under the sentencing scheme in place when he committed his crimes, a sex offender who committed the same class of felony as a non-sex offender would have been subject to only a discretionary parole term. The instant court disagreed with defendant. Contrary to defendant's assertion, sex offenders and non-sex offenders were subject to different parole laws and were not similarly situated for purposes of parole. Because defendant failed to raise the issue in the trial court, the instant court declined to address his contention that his mandatory parole sentence violated his right to due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facility acknowledged that it was subject to regulation by the CDPHE as a solid waste disposal site. The CDPHE served on the facility a compliance order asserting that it had not provided the required financial assurance. The facility neither provided financial assurance nor appealed the order to an administrative law judge. The facility argued that the compliance order did not become effective, and the appeal deadline never lapsed. The appellate court ruled that it agreed with the trial court that, as the compliance order became effective and the facility did not appeal, the facility failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, and the trial court properly found the facility's nonconstitutional defenses barred by its failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The facility was subject to the financial assurance requirement, and it did not dispute that it failed to provide financial assurance in response to the compliance order. The trial court acted within its discretion in assessing the penalty against the facility, as the trial court assessed a penalty of $ 17 per day, which was well below the statutory maximum $ 2,000 per day.</SPAN></P>

Defendant subsequently filed a motion to vacate the plea agreement, alleging that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over count one. The trial court ordered the plea withdrawn and the State appealed. The court vacated the order, stating that while defendant disputed the applicability of the direct filing statute in effect in 1997, 1996 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 283, &sect; 19-5-517 at 1640, it was undisputed that the crime charged in count two required sentencing under the crime of violence statute. Therefore, the trial court had jurisdiction over that count under the direct filing statute. It followed then that the district court had ancillary jurisdiction over count one because it had jurisdiction over count two, a crime mandating sentencing under the crime of violence statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also confirmed her understanding that her sentence could be a maximum of three years in the department of corrections. The appellate court found that: (1) by pleading guilty to count five, defendant admitted that she was an escapee at the time of the offense and waived the right to contest the factual basis for the charge, (2) the record showed that defendant was fully informed that her sentence would be aggravated by her status as an escapee, (3) defendant's guilty plea was the equivalent of having her escapee status proved beyond a reasonable doubt and Apprendi did not apply, and (4) the sentence imposed by the trial court was not illegal or unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient challenged a decision of the Fremont County District Court (Colorado), which dismissed his medical malpractice action against defendant physician based on the patient's failure to file a timely certificate of review pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-20-602 (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient filed this action pro se. The patient filed a verified certificate of review, but the trial court ordered him to identify the physician with whom the patient had consulted and obtain from him an affidavit. The patient requested an extension of time, but the trial court denied the request and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court rejected the patient's argument that the certificate of review statute did not govern actions brought by non-attorney pro se litigants. The court concluded that the statute requirements were applicable to civil actions alleging negligence of licensed professionals that were filed by non-attorney pro se plaintiffs. Thus, the trial court did not err in requiring the patient to file such a certificate, nor did the trial court err in requiring the patient to obtain an affidavit from the physician consulted for the certificate, which was permitted under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;13-20-602(3)(b) (2002). The trial court properly found that the patient's claims were of negligence. The trial court did err, however, in denying the patient's extension of time request and dismissing the action because the patient established good cause for the late filing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the finding that the certificate of review statute was applicable to the patient's action, which consisted of negligence claims, and that the patient was required to obtain an affidavit from the physician consulted for the certificate. The court reversed the denial of the patient's motion for an extension of time. The matter was remanded for the patient to obtain the certificate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relying on Apprendi v. New Jersey, defendant argued that the trial court violated her due process rights by imposing an aggravated range sentence. Specifically, defendant argued that her sentence was improper because the statutory aggravating factor, her bond status, was not charged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The instant court found no basis for reversal. The holding in Apprendi was procedural rather than substantive. Applying the analysis in Teague v. Lane, the instant court concluded that Apprendi did not establish a watershed rule to be accorded retroactivity in collateral review proceedings. Apprendi did not alter the basic understanding of the bedrock procedural requirements essential to a fair proceeding. Regarding defendant's contention that the trial court erred by sentencing her in the aggravated range, because it failed to make specific findings on the record detailing the extraordinary circumstances for imposing a sentence outside the presumptive sentencing range, the instant court found no error because the trial court stated on the record the specific reasons for sentencing defendant in the aggravated range.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the parents' divorce, the mother received sole custody of their minor child. All parenting time awarded to the father was to be supervised by the grandmother, his mother. After the mother successfully terminated the father's parenting time, the trial court continued the grandmother's visitation. The mother appealed, arguing Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-1-117 (2001) was unconstitutional on its face, and that the award of visitation to the grandmother under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-1-117 (2001) unconstitutionally infringed upon her fundamental rights as a parent because her decisions concerning that issue were given no special weight. The appellate court initially noted Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-1-117 (2001) was not unconstitutional as it mandated not only that the mother's preferences be considered, but also that deference be accorded to parental decisions in making the custody determination. However, the appellate court held the trial court failed to make findings concerning the child's best interests, did not accord the mother's proposed visitation schedule any special weight, and did not address whether and how that schedule failed to meet the child's best interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate's opponent filed a complaint with appellee, the Colorado Secretary of State, alleging, inter alia, that the candidate had violated the Act by failing to report his own and his campaign committee's contributions and expenditures in May and June 2000. The candidate argued that the administrative law judge erred by concluding he was required to report his expenditures from personal funds, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-45-108 (2001). The instant court rejected the candidate's argument that because he had a candidate committee and that because a candidate could have only one candidate committee, it was legally impossible for the candidate to be a candidate committee bound by the reporting requirements. The expenditures were subject to the disclosure requirements of &sect; 1-45-108. The instant court rejected the candidate's argument that any requirement in the Act that a candidate disclose personal campaign expenditures was unconstitutionally vague. The Act did not inhibit a candidate's expenditures of personal funds so long as those expenditures were made through a candidate committee and reported in accordance with the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of second degree burglary, three counts of theft, one count of second degree forgery, and one count of first degree criminal trespass. Upon being adjudicated a habitual offender, he was sentenced to life imprisonment by the El Paso County District Court (Colorado). Defendant appealed the trial court's order denying his second motion for postconviction relief under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a second Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) motion, alleging: (1) further ineffectiveness of trial and appellate counsel, (2) ineffectiveness of postconviction counsel, and (3) illegality of his habitual criminal sentence. Thereafter, he filed an amended motion which included a claim of newly discovered evidence. The trial court held the claims were time barred under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402(1) because they were not brought within three years of the trial court's denial of postconviction relief. The appellate court concluded that defendant's motion was subject to the three-year limitation period of &sect; 16-5-402(1), and because that period commenced upon the completion of defendant's direct appeal, it had expired. Moreover, the &sect; 16-5-402(1) limitation period was not tolled while defendant litigated his earlier motion for postconviction relief. However, as to the belated filing of his claims, the exception was defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. It was a fact question as to whether defendant's postconviction relief counsel was ineffective in failing to raise those claims and whether excusable neglect existed on those claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court was affirmed with respect to the denial of defendant's newly discovered evidence and illegal sentence claims; otherwise, the order was vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in its instruction to the jury on the fraud by check charges. The appellate court found that instructing the jury in the precise language of Colo. Rev.

The statute did not relieve the prosecution of its burden of proof. The special rule instruction was defective, as it did not make clear that evidence of defendant's insufficient funds in the bank created only an allowable inference that the jury could use, but was not required to use, in determining whether the prosecutor proved the knowing element of the fraud by check statute. It violated due process of law by shifting the burden of producing evidence or the burden of persuasion on an essential element of the crime. The prosecution's failure to prove the venue for the offense of acting as a small-volume dealer of livestock without a license was not in error, as Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-16-115(1)(e) (2001) did not require proof of venue as an element of the offense. Defendant also failed to challenge venue, as required by the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The trial court sua sponte informed jurors just before it delivered the transcript that they should consider all the evidence together with the instructions the trial court had given, one of which instructed that the jury should consider all the facts and circumstances that affected the credibility of each witness. Those instructions reduced the danger that the jurors would place undue emphasis on the transcript. In a discussion with counsel before responding to the jury's request, the trial court specifically noted that it would consider the concerns about overemphasis, the time required to furnish the testimony, and the jury's desire to have it. It noted that the requested testimony was brief, that the case had lasted only two days, that the testimony contained information that was helpful to both sides, and that a corrected transcript would be available within 15 minutes. Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction entered on a jury verdict in the Arapahoe County District Court (Colorado), finding him guilty of two counts of sexual assault on a child-pattern (counts one and two), and one count each of attempted aggravated incest, attempted sexual assault on a child-position of trust, attempted incest, and attempted first degree sexual assault. He also appealed the sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence established that defendant sexually assaulted the victims on six different occasions. Defendant contended his convictions for counts one and two should have been vacated, as the jury verdict form did not require that the jury make a unanimous finding that defendant committed the predicate offense of sexual assault on a child apart from the pattern determination. The appellate court concluded the verdict form was incorrect, but the mistake was not plain error, as there was no reasonable possibility that this error contributed to defendant's convictions. The appellate court agreed, in part, that the prosecution failed to prove all the requisite elements of the two pattern offenses, because with respect to count one, the prosecution failed to prove that defendant committed an incident of sexual assault that preceded the predicate act. However, defendant's argument that count one could not serve as an incident of sexual assault to establish the pattern in count two was rejected. Defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient because certain incidents did not occur in the county of the trial was rejected, as venue was not an element of the offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's judgment and sentence was reversed as to count one, and the case was remanded for resentencing on that count and correction of the mittimus.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The theatres argued that the trial court erred in applying an intermediate scrutiny standard to determine that the admissions tax was not unconstitutional. The appellate court found that the tax applied to all places or events for which a price was charged for admission, regardless of whether the activity involved protected speech and regardless of content. There was no indication from the design or operation of the tax that the city's purpose was to burden a particular message or that there was a threat of such a burden. There was no evidence of actual or threatened suppression of, or a legislative intent to burden, particular ideas or viewpoints. There was no evidence that the tax was imposed selectively on the theatres' events. The tax applied to all movie theatres that charged admission, regardless of their size or the content of movies shown. The tax was imposed on other diverse activities, such that a restraining force existed to prevent the city from changing the tax based solely on the theatres' choice of movies to exhibit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over defense counsel's objection, the defendant entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. Nearly seven months later, counsel reported that, after contacting 12 experts, he was unable to produce any credible evidence in support of an insanity defense. At counsel's request and over defendant's objection, the trial court vacated the defendant's insanity plea and entered, in its stead, a plea of not guilty. The defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by entering the not guilty plea. The court of appeals disagreed. According to the defendant, evidence of earlier mental illness and recent erratic behavior, combined with his own testimony, supported his theory that, because of his background, he was fearful of law enforcement and incarceration and thus shot at the police to scare them away. The defendant's proffered evidence and the theory it supported did not support an insanity plea or defense. He did not proffer any evidence that he was unable to distinguish right from wrong or to form the requisite intent because of a mental disease or defect. Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Morgan County District Court (Colorado) sentencing her to concurrent terms of 12-years with a 5-year period of mandatory parole, including $ 138,777 in restitution following her guilty plea to theft and unauthorized use of a financial transaction device.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plea agreement provided for a sentencing cap of 12-years and defendant agreed to pay restitution of $ 136,053 plus accrued finance charges on several credit card accounts. Defendant argued that the trial court violated her right to protection against ex post facto application of the law by imposing the 12-percent interest rate under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;16-18.5-103 (2001), and asserted that the rule of lenity required that the interest rate be set at 8-percent. The appellate court ruled that the imposition of 12-percent interest from the date of the order of conviction properly recognized that if restitution was not paid immediately, then victims were entitled to compensation for the delay in return of their money. Imposing prospective interest at a reasonable rate on an order of restitution did not, by itself, make the punishment more onerous in violation of the prohibition against ex post facto legislation. Furthermore, the rule of lenity did not apply and the trial court did not err in imposing interest at the rate of 12-percent.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-109(2) (2001). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, one of defendant's classmates testified that, after the shootings at Columbine High School, defendant told her that he had a list of students he was going to kill and that she was &quot;number one&quot; on his list. Another student testified that she heard him state that he was going to &quot;kill everybody who told on him.&quot; A third student testified that he was in the lunchroom pointing out &quot;specific people that he would or would not target.&quot; All three students stated that they missed an hour or more of classes in order to discuss these statements with the school principal and police. Another student testified that she told him to stop making threats, as he was frightening her friends; he &quot;said he did not care&quot; and did not take her seriously. The principal testified that the school had a handbook regarding harassment and threats of violence. The appellate court found the evidence sufficient to establish that defendant was aware his intimidation and threats were practically certain to impede the students' pursuit of educational activities.  Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-109(2) was narrowly tailored and did not prohibit all willful conduct that impeded education. Thus, it was not too vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The presentence report indicated that defendant was not a candidate for prison, and it recommended probation. However, defendant was not eligible for probation because she was subject to a pending charge in another case then scheduled for trial, because she had one previous felony conviction, and the present offense was a class three felony. The trial court sentenced defendant to the minimum required by the statute without any consideration of a greater sentence. Defendant's probationary status at the time of the offenses dictated that, at a minimum, she receive the 10-year sentence ultimately imposed. Defendant's sentence fell within the original presumptive range, and that sentence could have been imposed even if Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-105(9)(a)(III) was not applicable. Colorado's sentencing scheme permitted discretionary sentencing in an aggravated range based on unenumerated extraordinary aggravating circumstances; therefore, &sect; 18-1-105(9)(a)(III) was not unconstitutional as applied, and that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's postconviction motion.</SPAN></P>

The ALJ also found that claimant's refusal, after two surgeries, to undergo further injections and surgeries was reasonable and afforded no basis for reducing benefits. The appellate court rejected the employer's contention that the ALJ's order awarding compensation was void because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-201 (2001), which gave ALJs jurisdiction to hear and decide matters arising under the Workers' Compensation Act, conflicted with Colo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9. The Workers' Compensation Act, enacted by the general assembly under the state's police power, gave ALJs, rather than district courts, original jurisdiction to hear matters arising under the Act. Further, parties in workers' compensation proceedings expressly surrendered common law rights for the benefits of the Act. Finally, claimant's maximum medical improvement status was supported by substantial evidence, and the ALJ was not required to find the proposed surgery posed unusual risks before she could find that claimant's refusal of the additional surgery was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The trial court allowed two police officers who participated in the search of the defendant's apartment to testify regarding items of drug paraphernalia that were recovered: two spoons containing heroin residue, which were recovered under a mattress along with one of the alprazolam pills, and a marihuana pipe and a quantity of marihuana, which were recovered from a chair close to the nightstand where the other two alprazolam pills were found. The trial court determined that the evidence was admissible as res gestae. However, in an effort to minimize any prejudice to defendant, the court gave the jury a limiting instruction regarding the use that it could make of the evidence. The evidence of illegal drug paraphernalia was relevant to the question of the defendant's knowledge of the nature of the codeine and alprazolam pills recovered from his apartment and their illegality in the absence of a prescription.

The employee petitioned to reopen his claim alleging that his condition had worsened. The employee argued that the administrative law judge (ALJ) erred in failing to give his division-sponsored independent medical examination (DIME) presumptive effect. The court of appeals disagreed. The reopening authority under the provisions of Colo. Rev.

Although medical evidence bearing on whether the employee remained at maximum medical improvement (MMI) would have been relevant to whether he had suffered a deterioration in his condition, the original MMI determination could not be questioned. Therefore the opinion of a DIME physician as to whether the employee's condition had worsened carried no special weight and need not have been overcome by clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>

It was undisputed that the citizen wished to carry an unconcealed firearm on his person in Denver and to carry a concealed firearm in a motor vehicle in Denver, and that these activities, subject to certain exceptions, were prohibited by the ordinances. Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code &sect; 38-117 prohibited anyone except a law enforcement officer in the performance of duty to conceal a deadly weapon. Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code &sect; 38-118 provided an exception for concealed weapons carried for lawful protection of a person or his property. The ordinances were a reasonable exercise of the police power, and the challenger failed to meet his burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the restrictions were a severe infringement on the right to bear arms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with aggravated robbery, conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery, second degree assault, and first degree burglary. Before trial, defendant filed motions to suppress the evidence of the victim's out-of-court identification and other evidence seized from defendant's home. The court denied the motions. The jury found defendant guilty as charged. Defendant was sentenced to 20 years on the aggravated robbery count, 15 years on the second degree assault count, and 10 years on the crime of violence count, with those sentences to run consecutively to one another and concurrently with the 5 year sentence on the conspiracy count. Defendant contended that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to suppress the evidence of the victim's identification of defendant from the photographic array. The appellate court rejected his claims. Under the totality of the circumstances, the victim's identification of defendant was not unreliable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who attempted to murder his stepdaughter and her boyfriend, pled not guilty by reason of insanity. A unitary trial was held on both insanity and guilt, and he was convicted.

Defendant did not make the request required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-107(1.5)(a) for a jury instruction limiting the use of the statements. The court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress statements he made to a fellow inmate, because defendant did not meet his burden of proving that the inmate was acting as a paid informant for the police. Nor did the trial court err in admitting statements that defendant made to a police detective during a second interrogation without a second advisement of rights, because it was clear from the facts that defendant understood and had voluntarily waived his rights. Finally, the court found that the trial court had not abused its discretion in admitting testimony of his stepdaughter, as to previous threats to hit her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's girlfriend's infant died after being rushed to the hospital while in defendant's care. The child was found to have suffered injuries consistent with acceleration/deceleration and blunt trauma, though the cause of death was complications from a blunt trauma to her head. Defendant admitted to shaking the infant and to having accidentally hit her head on the crib. The prosecution presented expert testimony to prove that the child's injuries were so great that defendant had to have known that his actions were practically certain to cause death. The appellate court found that the expert's examples of similar injuries caused by obviously extreme force and trauma were not relevant to the issue of the minimum amount of force necessary for defendant to have inflicted the injury that caused the child's death. It was reversible error for both the expert and the prosecutor to have suggested that the extreme examples constituted the minimum force applied by defendant. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the distinction of a position of trust was not nominal and sufficiently justified the harsher penalty imposed under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-401(7)(c) (2001).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent accountant appealed the order of petitioner Colorado State Board of Accountancy, which fined him $ 1,000 and ordered him to complete eight hours of continuing education in ethics for not registering his professional corporation, as required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;12-2-117 (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1990, the accountant incorporated as a professional corporation; he was the firm's sole practitioner. The board initiated disciplinary proceedings against the accountant for failing to register his professional corporation. The accountant argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2-117 (2001) clearly and unambiguously required only firms composed of more than one accountant to register with the board. The court ruled that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2-117 (2001) provided a sufficiently definite standard to ensure uniform, nondiscriminatory enforcement. The board had jurisdiction to conduct a disciplinary hearing and was authorized to impose sanctions. Also, the board's finding that the accountant did not willfully violate the statute was used as a mitigating factor in its determination of sanctions, not a determination that the statute contained a scienter element. The court further ruled that the board did not have jurisdiction to consider the accountant's constitutional challenges, and the entry of partial summary judgment on the remaining issues was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiffs dog trainers filed a complaint in the City and County of Denver District Court (Colorado) alleging that a drug testing regulation of the defendants Director of the Colorado Department of Revenue Division of Racing and the Colorado Racing Commission (director) constituted an unreasonable search. The director filed a motion for summary judgment which was granted. The trainers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trainers argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in granting the director's motion for summary judgment because the director had no special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement to support drug testing without probable cause. The court of appeals agreed. The record was devoid of any reference to any injury caused by, or suffered by, or race corruption attributable to a dog trainer, whether drug-impaired or not. The only evidence in the record relevant to any of those issues was an investigation report, which stated that the division conducted 289 case investigations in 1999, 52 of which resulted in a criminal filing. The report did not indicate what offenses were charged, or whether any of the criminal filings were against dog trainers. Moreover, it was unclear from the evidence whether dog trainers had ever been involved in any corrupt activity, or whether the type of corruption that had occurred within the industry was of a kind to which drug-impaired dog trainers would be particularly susceptible, or which would threaten the integrity of racing. Therefore, the trial court erred by granting summary judgment for the director.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that (1) defendant did not make an offer of proof relating to a choice of evils defense, as required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-702(2) (2001), so there was no error in the failure to give that instruction; (2) the prosecution's remarks regarding the defendant's relationship with the victim were based on properly admitted res gestae evidence, and defendant did not object to statements later claimed to be misstatements of law, therefore the prosecution's remarks were not plainly erroneous; (3) the defendant's excuses were insufficient to permit a belated attack if the prior convictions had been in Colorado, and he was not free of &quot;culpable neglect&quot; to challenge the earlier convictions; and (4) the department of correction records used were sufficiently self-authenticated under Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of being a special drug offender, possession with intent to sell 28 grams or more of cocaine, possession with intent to sell methamphetamine, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, and possession of more than eight ounces of marijuana. The City and County of Denver District Court (Colorado) denied his motion for postconviction relief, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he was improperly convicted of possession of 28 grams of cocaine, because there was no such offense. The appellate court agreed that it was error to include possession of 28 grams as an element of the possession charge, because the factor was a sentence enhancer and not an element of the crime. However, the error did not violate defendant's due process rights. Defendant's conviction as a special offender was error, as there was no such offense. It was error to enhance defendant's sentence for cocaine possession due to his possessing over 28 grams, because the special offender enhancer had already been applied and the sentence could not be enhanced twice on a single count. The trial court erred in not applying the special offender/deadly weapon enhancer to the methamphetamine count, as the jury had found defendant guilty of the sentence enhancer on this count as well, and enhancement was mandatory. Defendant's constitutional claim was not considered, as he had raised it on direct appeal. Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed, as he did not show that his counsel's failure to introduce letters into evidence would have changed the outcome.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence imposed on the special offender count was vacated. That portion of the order amending defendant's 12-year sentence for possession with intent to sell methamphetamine was reversed, and the case was remanded for amendment of the mittimus. The balance of the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an overnight standoff, defendant escaped with a young woman in a stolen car. A high-speed chase ensued wherein defendant fired numerous rounds of ammunition. Defendant claimed the trial court erred in its response to an inquiry from the jury. The court of appeals held that the trial court's hypothetical of throwing a soft object, in response to a jury question, was a comment on the evidence and not a proper instruction on the law. The hypothetical did not reduce the State's burden of proof, and there was no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled into finding that defendant committed attempted reckless manslaughter solely because he possessed and used an instrument capable of causing death. However, the hypothetical did not constitute plain error. The trial court did not err in imposing an aggravated sentence of six years for vehicular eluding pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-105(6) (2001). Defendant received a sentence to which he was exposed by the original charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee contended that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10-4-508(1)(a) (2000), which limited the claims the insurer had to pay, violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection and denied him access to the courts in violation of Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 6. One of the purposes of the Colorado Insurance Guaranty Association Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10-4-501 et seq. (2000), was to avoid excessive delay in payment and financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer. The exclusion of late claims served that purpose. A limitation provision served legitimate governmental purposes, such as ensuring finality and the prompt recovery of reimbursement by the guaranty association from the estates of insolvent insurers. Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 6, provided a procedural right to a judicial assembly whenever the general assembly created a substantive right that accrued under Colorado law. Because the employee did not file a timely claim in the insurer's receivership proceeding, his claim was not a covered claim under the Act. He had no cognizable legal basis to recover.</SPAN></P>

The bond required that he refrain from having any contact with the victim. Thereafter, the State filed an information alleging several bond violations. After the trial court revoked his bond, defendant argued the trial court was without jurisdiction because the information failed to charge an offense with sufficient specificity. Further, he argued Colo. Rev.

The appellate court reviewed the information and dispensed with defendant's first argument by noting it enumerated with particularity several conditions that had been violated and allowed defendant to prepare an adequate defense. The appellate court concluded Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-4-103(2) (2000) sufficiently limited the trial court's authority to impose conditions on bail, therefore, Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were sent sanction notices, which did not include full or accurate information about the sanctions and the appeal process. Defendants were properly considered persons under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The &quot;no entitlement&quot; language in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 601 et seq., did not vitiate all forms of property rights in welfare benefits. Plaintiffs had a right to receive cash assistance benefits if such benefits were available and, if plaintiffs were eligible, defendants were required to make such payments. Plaintiffs therefore had a right to procedural due process and the record supported a finding that the notices contained patent deficiencies. Although individual plaintiffs had a process by which to contest personal sanctions, defendants' practice of uniformly reinstating welfare benefits foreclosed individual plaintiffs from the opportunity to contest the inadequacy of sanction notices in general.</SPAN></P>

The record supported the trial court's findings that defendant became a resident of Colorado in May of 1998. Defendant did not lose her residency in Colorado by her temporary return to New York.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he maintained an apartment with the aid of public housing benefits, but drove to his girlfriend's residence in another county in order to watch the girlfriend's children, and returned to his apartment every evening. Plaintiff claimed that defendant resided most of the time in the other county.  Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-401(1) (2000) required proof beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly obtained anything of value that was the property of another. The appellate court held the local housing authority had no definition of &quot;principal residence&quot; upon which it determined eligibility for housing benefits. Accordingly, defendant had no basis upon which to determine whether his living arrangements violated the requirement. The appellate court held the &quot;principal residence&quot; requirement was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. The appellate court held that 10 Colo. Code Regs. &sect; 2506-1, &sect; B-4211 provided that applicants who maintained a residence in the county in question were eligible for food stamps. Therefore, the regulation did not prevent appellant from receiving food stamps, as appellant maintained a residence in Larimer County.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals affirmed, holding that while the Spoto/Garner tests should have been employed, the record supported the admission of the similar acts evidence, as the evidence related to appellant's intent, and showed a pattern of behavior in committing sexual assaults that did not relate to any character flaws or propensity. The letters were relevant to intent and demonstrated that appellant knew the difference between consensual sex and rape.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dispute regarding entitlement to attorney and trustee fees under state Medicaid regulations, appellant Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing challenged a judgment by the Jefferson County District Court (Colorado) in favor of appellee estate finding that the payment of such fees was permitted in the closure of an income trust.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department contended that in the termination of the income trust, the trial court erred in allowing the payment of any attorney fees and the payment of trustee fees in excess of the amount allowed by the trust documents, in violation of state Medicaid regulations. The appellate court held that a plain reading of the pre-1996 regulations revealed that a court may determine the amount of trustee fees, so the trustee's fee for performing the final accounting was permissible. The court determined that reasonable attorney fees were expressly allowed under the trust and order, but the 1996 regulation disallowed payment of attorney fees. The court concluded that the 1996 regulation could not be applied to modify the trust, because such an interpretation would render the regulation a &quot;retrospective&quot; law. Thus, the appellate court held that the district court did not err in awarding attorney fees. The appellate court held that in light of its disposition, and its conclusion that the 1996 regulation was retrospective and inapplicable, the appellate court concluded that the court properly resolved this issue in awarding the trustee fees.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that it was not required to comply with the Act because its advertisements were &quot;issue&quot; advocacy, not &quot;express&quot; advocacy, and that to conclude otherwise would violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The instant court concluded that none of defendant's advertisements was &quot;express advocacy,&quot; as that term was construed and applied in the Buckley standard, because the advertisements did not explicitly urge a vote for the identified candidate. Rather, they favorably presented that candidate's position on issues and experience, or unfavorably presented the positions and experience of the other candidate, or both.

Plaintiff appealed and the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff's claims against defendant city and defendant police chief, but remanded for further proceedings as to the claims against defendant police officers. The claim against defendant city was properly dismissed because plaintiff failed to present evidence of a municipal policy that was the moving force behind the alleged deprivation of his civil rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of assault, kidnapping, and sexual assault, and was sentenced to 93.5 years. On appeal, he contended that evidence against him should have been suppressed and challenged several other procedures in the trial court. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that (1) the seizure and subsequent search of appellant's vehicle met the requirements of the automobile exception, and probable cause supported the later search at the police impound lot; (2) evidence of sexual assaults committed against two girls approximately two weeks before the charged offenses was properly admitted to show appellant's common plan and identity and was not unfairly prejudicial; (3) identification by one of the victims from a photo lineup was not unduly suggestive; (4) the determination whether there was enhancement was resolved by the jury under the appropriate legal standard and after proper notice to appellant; and (5) the counts were not supported by identical evidence, and did not require concurrent sentences. The court remanded with directions to correct the mittimus to reflect that appellant was sentenced to 91.5 years in prison.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to one count of aggravated robbery with a simulated weapon and one count of theft between $ 400 and $ 15,000. Defendant was sentenced to eight years for the aggravated robbery charge and four years for the theft charge, with the sentences to run consecutively. Defendant appealed an order of the Jefferson County District Court (Colorado) denying his Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that: (1) the trial court erred in sentencing him to mandatory parole for five years in accordance with the mandatory parole statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-105(1)(a)(V)(E) (2000); (2) the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad; and (3) he should have been required to serve only three years of mandatory parole; and (4) he should have been allowed to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. The appellate court upheld the trial court's decision denying defendant's motion for postconviction relief. The statute bore a rational relationship to the legitimate governmental interest of promoting the rehabilitation and reintegration of defendants while recognizing the need for public safety. Thus, the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The trial court properly sentenced defendant to five years of mandatory parole. Because the trial court had previously permitted defendant to proceed in forma pauperis on direct appeal, he only needed to attach a copy of the order granting him leave to proceed in forma pauperis on direct appeal to his notice of appeal so that he could continue to proceed in forma pauperis on the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed. Trial court did not err in sentencing defendant to five years of mandatory parole.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the photographic lineup was not impermissibly suggestive and did not violate defendant's constitutional right to due process. The evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for the second robbery. However, the first information containing two counts of aggravated robbery, one naming the first clerk as a victim of aggravated robbery and the other naming the second clerk as a victim of aggravated robbery, was multiplicitous and therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with assault and harassment. He was released on bond, a condition of which was that he have no contact with his wife. A restraining order was also issued.

Intimidation charge was unrelated to any underlying charge. Pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 18-8-704(1), 18-8-702 (2000), the jury was only required to find that defendant's wife was the victim of any crime. Defendant was not denied due process, as the trial court was not required to specifically advise him that violating bond could result in additional criminal charges. Trial court properly instructed the jury on the definition of &quot;unlawfully&quot; as that term was used in the intimidation instruction.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 18-3-305 (2000). Defendant appealed arguing that the trial court erred in failing to disqualify a venireman because of her difficulty in understanding English. Further, defendant contended that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-401(3.5) was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that a trial court is afforded great deference in determining whether a prospective juror had an adequate understanding of the English language. Also, the appellate court found that a statute was presumed constitutional, and a statute was not unconstitutional for vagueness if a person of ordinary and reasonable intelligence could understand the meaning of the statute. Finally, evidence of prior bad acts was admissible if introduced to show intent and to refute the defense of recent fabrication. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence. As such, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed because defendant failed to demonstrate that the trial court's ruling was unfair or arbitrary.

Defendant appealed the judgment of conviction entered upon a jury verdict finding him guilty of one count of driving after revocation prohibited. Defendant argued that because the jury instruction given at his trial did not include certain elements contained in the model jury instruction, the court should reverse his conviction. The court declined to do so. The jury instruction included each element of the crime, as set forth in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-206.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, as personal representative of decedent's estate, appealed from an order and judgment by the District Court of Larimer County (Colorado), which found that respondent, decedent's former spouse, was the beneficiary of the life insurance policy of decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1988, decedent purchased a life insurance policy from respondent insurer, naming his then wife, respondent ex-spouse, as the beneficiary. Four years later, the marriage of decedent and respondent ex-spouse was dissolved, but the decedent did not name a different beneficiary. The decedent continued to make semi-annual premium payments until his death in 1997. Petitioner, personal representative for the estate, filed a petition for declaratory judgment to determine whether respondent was entitled to receive the life insurance proceeds. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court found in favor of respondent ex-spouse. After agreeing with the trial court that respondent ex-spouse had standing to defend herself on any basis, the appellate court affirmed, holding that even if respondent ex-spouse did not have a vested interest prior to decedent's death, she had an expectancy interest in the life insurance policy which prohibited the retrospective application of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-11-804 (2000), a divorce revocation statute which modified Colorado's probate code in 1995.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed; once petitioner brought respondent ex-spouse into court, she could not challenge respondent's standing. Retroactive application of Colorado's statute would have substantially interfered with respondent's expectancy interest by revoking her rights as a beneficiary.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-110 et seq. (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Brought by ambulance to defendant private hospital, deceased lost consciousness after defendant resident, a public employee provided to hospital under an affiliation agreement, began to treat her. Despite defendants', resident and doctor, attempts, she died. Plaintiffs brought an action asserting claims for negligence against defendants resident, doctor, private and public hospitals. The trial court denied defendants', resident and doctor, motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (GIA), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-110 et seq. (2000), finding a waiver of sovereign immunity under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-106(1) (2000). After consolidating the separate interlocutory appeals, the court affirmed, holding that that the residency program, by furthering the purposes of defendant public hospital, constituted the operation of a public hospital under the GIA. The court further held that the GIA's provision making a public hospital responsible for litigation costs, &sect; 24-10-110(1), effectively did away with any limitation from liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior that a public hospital enjoyed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed; the trial court did not err in finding that governmental immunity had been waived because the actions of defendants, resident and doctor, fell within the operation of a public hospital for purposes of the immunity statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent and appellant were married in 1983. In 1987, they executed life insurance policies covering them both, with decedent naming appellant as his beneficiary. Decedent's will also designated appellant as his personal representative. In 1993, decedent and appellant entered into a separation agreement, which made neither made disposition of the insurance policy nor mentioned any rights under the will. The divorce was finalized in 1994. Appellee, decedent's brother, the contingent beneficiary of decedent's life insurance policy, and the alternate personal representative under the will, filed this action seeking a declaratory judgment that, as a matter of law, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-11-804(2) (2000) revoked appellant's interests. The trial court concluded that the statute applied retroactively. The appellate court affirmed, holding that the retroactive application of &sect; 15-11-804(2) did not violate the impairments of contracts clause under either the federal or the state constitution because appellant's right to recover did not occur until decedent's death, after the effective date of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the District Court of Grand County (Colorado), upon a jury verdict of guilty to sexual assault on a child, for lack of jurisdiction based on the lack of statutory or constitutional authority of the county court judge who entered the conviction to preside as an acting district court judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in district court of sexual assault on a child and asserted that jurisdiction was lacking because the county court judge who accepted the verdict and entered the conviction was not assigned such duties in accordance with statutory or constitutional authority. The court held that, because there was no written, direct order granting the county court judge the authority to preside in defendant's case, defendant's conviction was entered without jurisdiction. Defendant properly raised a nonfrivolous constitutional question and a strong policy regarding the proper administration of judicial business, and the county court judge was thus not a de facto judge. The appointment of the county court judge, which was not in accordance with statutory, constitutional, or chief justice directive provisions, was not a mere technical defect because it concerned the fundamental interest of defendant in ensuring that a qualified county court judge served as the acting district court judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial; defendant had a fundamental constitutional interest in having a qualified county court judge serve as acting district court judge, and the lack of proper constitutional or statutory authority of the county court judge who entered defendant's conviction thus precluded jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief following the adoption and implementation of a performance review for tenured faculty. Appellee sought dismissal and the lower court, after finding that the policy was merely procedural and not retrospective, entered summary judgment in appellee's favor. This judgment was affirmed. The court rejected appellant's argument that reviews under the new policy should have begun only after a five year waiting period. The appellant had improperly relied on alleged statements made by the faculty council, which had advised appellee on the policy. Appellee was the only body that had the statutory authority to change the faculty manual. Immediate implementation was proper. The court also rejected appellant's argument that the policy was applied retrospectively. The policy was retroactive and because the policy was merely procedural, such a change in the policy was permitted. Appellant had always been subject to reviews and discipline under the faculty manual. This was merely a change in remedy and did not constitute the impairment of a vested right, since there was no such thing as a vested right in remedies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pro se plaintiff inmate appealed the judgment and order of the District Court of Lincoln County (Colorado), which denied plaintiff's motion to proceed in forma pauperis under Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate sought to challenge a prison disciplinary action, but plaintiff was precluded from proceeding in forma pauperis by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-17.5-103 because there were sufficient funds in plaintiff's inmate account to pay the filing fee. The court held that denial of in forma pauperis status was mandatory under the statute, and the statute was not vague and did not violate plaintiff's constitutional rights to due process, equal protection, and access to the courts. While the statute may have required plaintiff to forgo outlays in order to keep enough funds in his account to pay the filing fee, that circumstance did not rise to the level of an infringement of his right of access to the courts. No fundamental right was otherwise involved, and neither prisoners nor indigents constituted a suspect class. Thus the statute did not involve any constitutional violations because it was rationally related to the state interest in limiting frivolous inmate lawsuits which unduly burdened the judicial system.</SPAN></P>

The device was found and defendant was eventually convicted of conspiracy to commit eavesdropping. The conviction was affirmed on direct appeal and defendant's Colo. R. Crim.

Defendant did not act to enforce the laws, but instead violated the law. Even if ordered to do so by the sheriff, it did not constitute a public duty because a court order was required for a listening device.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant sought review of the final order issued by the Industrial Claim Appeals Office (Colorado), which upheld denial for workers' compensation benefits on the basis that claimant's participation in weightlifting was a &quot;recreational&quot; activity within the meaning of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-40-201(8) (1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant substitute teacher injured himself while he was weightlifting in the high school weight room. Claimant sought a determination that his injury arose out of and in the course of his employment, and therefore, was compensable. Following a hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) ruled that claimant had been engaged in a voluntary recreational activity and denied him benefits. The Industrial Claim Appeals Office upheld that determination on review. Accepting claimant's argument that weightlifting related to physical fitness, the court affirmed, holding that it was reasonable for the ALJ to have concluded that the accident was a &quot;recreational activity,&quot; and therefore, noncompensable under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-40-201(8) (1999). The court further rejected claimant's contention that the Workers' Compensation Statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-40-101 et seq. (1999), was unconstitutionally vague, concluding that the lack of a definition of &quot;recreational&quot; did not create ambiguity as to the type of activity intended to be excluded from employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order denying workers' compensation benefits was affirmed. Claimant's voluntary participation in weightlifting activities was a &quot;recreational activity&quot; which did not arise out of and in the course of his employment as a teacher. Lack of statutory definition of &quot;recreational&quot; did not create ambiguity, and thus, statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexually assaulting two women and of being an habitual criminal. Defendant challenged, on appeal, the denial of his petition for postconviction relief. Defendant argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-104 (1999) and Colo. R. Crim. P. 24(d) impermissibly distinguished between those defendants facing life in prison as a result of an habitual criminal conviction, and those facing the same consequence as a result of a conviction for a capital offense where the death penalty cannot or would not be imposed. The court, however, perceived no error in the ruling that defendant's equal protection rights were not violated. Defendant maintained that his convictions had to be reversed because the advisement of the right to testify he received was improper. The court found no error in the advisement. The judgment of conviction at issue was not void ab initio and was constitutionally obtained. In light of the correct instructions to the jury outlining all of the elements necessary to an habitual criminal finding, the court was not persuaded that the verdict forms were inadequate. The denial of defendant's motion for postconviction relief was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Vice detective observed a &quot;known prostitute&quot; get into the passenger side of defendant's pickup truck.

The garage, located in an adjacent county, was outside the jurisdiction of detective's municipal police department. Based upon her observations, the detective contacted defendant and asked for identification. Defendant admitted that his driver's license had been revoked as a habitual traffic offender. After the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress, a jury convicted defendant. Although agreeing that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-3-106 did not authorize the detective to pursue defendant outside her jurisdiction, the court affirmed, holding that detective's contact with defendant did not constitute an unconstitutional seizure because she had observed sufficient facts to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in criminal activity with a prostitute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of a disturbance, a tenant called police to remove defendant from a residence.

Before trial, defendant anesthesiologist's motion for summary judgment was granted because the trial court concluded that no duty was owed. The jury awarded plaintiff $ 4,950,730. The trial court then denied plaintiff's request for lump-sum payment, concluding that under the Health Care Availability Act (HCAA), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-64-205(1)(f), plaintiff as a &quot;protected person&quot; with a conservator was ineligible to receive lump-sum payment. The appellate court reversed the dismissal of defendant anesthesiologist, and remanded for a new trial for the sole purpose of allocating fault because more than one proximate cause of injury existed. The appellate court further held that while court did not err in its determination under the HCAA, the statute, as applied, violated equal protection because distinction between incapacitated and capacitated was arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

Among defendant's points of error, he argued that the pattern complicity instruction unconstitutionally lessened the prosecution's burden of proof because the instruction did not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a mental state necessary to establish liability as a complicitor on the aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated robbery crimes. Defendant argued that because his knowledge of the principals' intent to commit the aggravated robberies was disputed at trial, the omission of the &quot;intent to promote or facilitate&quot; language was plain error. According to the court, the jury was correctly instructed that to convict, it had to find that defendant had knowledge that the principals intended to commit aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated robbery. The court held that because the pattern complicity instruction adequately advised the jury of the requisite dual mental state requirements to convict under a complicity theory, the instruction did not unconstitutionally lessen the prosecution's burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

P. 12(b)(1) on the basis that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (GIA), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-101 et seq. Plaintiff contended that the trial court erred in determining that her state law claims were barred under the GIA. Plaintiff failed to timely file a notice of claim and properly serve the notice before filing a complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with several counts of burglary, attempted sexual assault, and criminal mischief arising from an incident in which defendant drilled holes and inserted peeping devices in bathroom floors of two homes in which he had performed maintenance work. Prior to trial, defendant moved to suppress his statements to the investigating officer during the second interrogation as having been involuntary. The motion was denied and defendant was found guilty. The court affirmed the convictions for sexual assault and criminal mischief, but reversed the burglary conviction, holding that the prosecution had failed to prove that defendant unlawfully entered, or unlawfully remained, within the meaning of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-203 (1999). Testimony of the residents of both homes clearly indicated that defendant had permission to enter their homes and that that permission had not been withdrawn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was transferred to a private corrections facility in Texas to serve a portion of his sentence. He was later transferred back to a privately operated corrections facility in Colorado. Defendant asserted that Colo. Rev.

The court held that when &sect;&sect; 30-11-101(1)(h), 16-11-308.5 were read together, they did not limit placement of Colorado inmates to county jails. They had to be read as supplementary to and not as superseding the authority granted to the director of the department of corrections by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-1-105(f) to transfer inmates out of state. Defendant argued that &sect; 17-1-105(1)(f) was unconstitutional as violative of the Compact Clause and the Commerce Clause. Defendant did not establish that &sect; 17-1-105(1)(f) impaired any of his constitutional rights. Defendant had no right to be housed in a particular facility.

At least five mobile home permits were issued to residents. Plaintiff issued a mobile home permit to one defendant, provided that he made a few exterior modifications to the home. Plaintiff was aware of continuous and repeated variances in the application of the restrictive covenants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From 1983 through 1989, the hospital where plaintiff was employed used ethylene oxide sterilizers manufactured by defendant.

After apportioning the liability between defendant, hospital and two non-parties, the jury awarded plaintiff compensatory damages. Defendant appealed on numerous points. The court affirmed, holding that there was evidence to support findings that plaintiff proceeded with reasonable diligence, thus defendant's motion for directed verdict was properly denied under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-80-109 (1999) and that the trial court neither abused its discretion in admitting expert testimony under Colo. R. Evid. 703 nor evidence regarding plaintiff's fear of cancer.

On appeal, the court found that since appellant was served in the state of Colorado, where both mother and the child resided, the trial court had personal jurisdiction to determine the issues of paternity and child support. Further, the court rejected appellant's contention that the child support orders violated his rights under the state and federal ex post facto clauses, since Col. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-14-104(1)(b) was not unconstitutional merely because the facts upon which it operated occurred before the adoption of the statute. Also, since the child support guidelines were applied to appellant's current income, the statute did not implicate due process or equal protection concerns.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgments affirmed; there could be no retroactive application of a law creating child support obligations, since duty of support arose at time of child's birth regardless of appellant's knowledge, and since the child support guidelines were applied to appellant's current income, due process and equal protection concerns were not implicated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order denying his Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) motion without a hearing. The lower court's reasoning was that his motion was both time-barred and substantially meritless. Defendant appealed, arguing his motion was not time-barred because he couldn't file it until a previous court ruling and he filed his motion within three years of the date of that decision. The court found that defendant used an incorrect date for the running of when he could file his motion because the decision defendant cited was not the correct date for when that time began to run. Consequently, since defendant's motion was time-barred under the correct date, there was no error in the lower court denying his motion without a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order was affirmed as the court found defendant used an incorrect date to begin the running of when he could file his motion and, consequently, his motion was time-barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant sought review of a Colorado Industrial Claim Appeals Office order denying her mental impairment workers' compensation claim because she failed to present the live testimony of a physician or psychologist in support of her claim, as required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-41-301(2)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant, a Department of Corrections officer, sought workers' compensation benefits after being told not to return to work after suffering severe chest pains and high blood pressure attributed to a panic attack arising from job stress. Although claimant's medical reports supported her claim, because she presented no live testimony, the administrative law judge ruled that the reports were insufficient to support her claim. The court set aside the order denying her claim and remanded for reconsideration. The court rejected claimant's argument that her physical symptoms constituted a &quot;physical injury&quot; because her own reports concluded that her symptoms resulted only from the mental stress of her job. The court agreed, however, with claimant that the requirement in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-41-301(2)(a) that a mental impairment claimant produce a live witness, even if the reports submitted raised no objection, served no legitimate purpose, and was an unconstitutional equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order was set aside and case was remanded for further consideration; requirement that a mental impairment claimant, unlike a physical impairment claimant, produce a live witness even when medical reports submitted raised no objection, served no legitimate purpose and was an unconstitutional equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>
