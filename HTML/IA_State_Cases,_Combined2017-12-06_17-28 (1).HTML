Her right of compulsory process could not be claimed in a vacuum. She did not claim there were any witnesses whose testimony was denied her because she did not know she could force them to testify. She therefore did not establish any prejudice. Her conclusory claim of prejudice, that she was ready to insist on going to trial, was not a sufficient assertion of prejudice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction and sentence for delivery of methamphetamine, more than five grams, in violation of Iowa Code &sect; 124.401(1)(b)(7). Defendant challenged the rulings of the Iowa District Court for Marshall County (Iowa) that, inter alia, allowed into evidence the methamphetamine he was accused of delivering and a lab report regarding the drug, over his chain-of-custody objection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant also appealed the rulings that: (1) denied his motion for judgment of acquittal based upon insufficiency of the evidence; (2) denied his motion for new trial based on his allegation that the district court failed to act in a neutral and detached manner; and (3) rejected his constitutional challenges to Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 901.10(2) and 907.3(3)(e). The Supreme Court of Iowa preserved for postconviction relief proceedings defendant's claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to raise in district court the application of strict scrutiny to defendant's equal protection claim. The supreme court also held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing into evidence the methamphetamine and lab report regarding it over defendant's chain-of-custody objection. The court correctly refused to grant defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal and did not improperly aid the State on the chain-of-custody issue. Finally, the district court correctly rejected defendant's constitutional challenges to the sentencing statutes in question. The statutes did not violate defendant's Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights or his rights under the Iowa Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa District Court for Clinton County granted summary judgment in favor of defendant manufacturer in plaintiff propane supplier's suit against the manufacturer for contribution or indemnity. The supplier appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An explosion occurred at a residence when a serviceman from the supplier attempted to re-light the pilot light on the furnace. The homeowners sued the supplier, alleging that the supplied failed to check for leaks in the system. The supplier in turn claimed the manufacturer furnished a defective gas valve for the furnace. The supplier argued that the manufacturer was a party whose actual fault caused the defect, and the statute of repose under Iowa Code &sect; 614.1(2A) did not outlaw the supplier's claims for contribution or indemnity against the manufacturer. The appellate court found that by applying Iowa Code &sect; 614.1(11), the act alleged to have been the cause of the injury was the manufacturer's manufacture of the valve, not the installation. More than 15 years had passed since the manufacturer made the valve. Because the case involved a product attached to real estate, it was controlled by &sect; 614.1(11), not &sect; 614.1(2A). The third-party plaintiff's claims of contribution or indemnity were therefore subject to the 15-year statute of repose. Section 614.1(11) did not deny claimants their constitutional right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother challenged the new appellate procedures on appeal from a termination of parental rights on two grounds: equal protection and procedural due process. Specifically the mother complained that she was limited to raising her claims of error in a petition on appeal rather than in a traditional brief. The mother failed to challenge the constitutionality of the governing rules in her petition on appeal. The Iowa Supreme Court found that: (1) the expedited appellate procedure that permitted only a petition on review rather than a full briefing did not violate procedural due process because the procedures that were available substantially minimized any risk of error, (2) the expedited appellate procedure did not violate equal protection because it was narrowly tailored to advance the State's interest in providing a permanent placement for children as soon as reasonably possible, and (3) the mother's counsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to raise the constitutional issues in the petition on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the decision of the ALJ and the trial court and concluded the trust in this case was a MQT. As conservator, the son's parents were acting on behalf the son when they created the trust with his settlement funds. Because the entire trust corpus was available to the son, he was ineligible for Medicaid benefits. Furthermore, the trust was not entitled to an exemption from treatment as a MQT as the home in which the son and his parents lived did not constitute in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded. Finally, the conservators' Due Process and Equal Protection arguments were not considered as the district court did not make any findings on those issues and the conservators did not request the court to enlarge its factual findings and legal conclusions.</SPAN></P>

Appellee executor of the wife's estate requested a determination in the husband's estate that all jointly held property of the couple was property of the wife's estate. Appellant heirs of the husband resisted. The Wapello County District Court (Iowa) held the property passed to the wife's estate pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 633.535 (1999), Iowa's felonious death statute. The heirs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the heirs argued that Iowa Code &sect; 633.535(2) governed the disposition of joint tenancy property, and that under the statute only the husband's rights of survivorship were lost, not his undivided interest in the joint tenancy property. The heirs contended that the statute had the effect of terminating the joint tenancy, causing each tenant's undivided interest to pass through that tenant's estate. The appellate court agreed with the heirs and reversed. The supreme court noted that in &sect; 633.535(2) the legislature expressly eliminated a murderer's right of survivorship, the hallmark characteristic of a joint tenancy; thus, the court held that the legislature intended that one joint tenant's murder of the other joint tenant severed the joint tenancy and created a tenancy in common. Thus, &sect; 633.535(2) meant that the wife's share of the joint tenancy property passed through her estate and the husband's share of the joint tenancy property passed through his estate. Thus, the husband lost his survivorship rights, not his share of the joint tenancy property. The trial court erred in holding that the wife's estate was the owner of all joint tenancy property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee department held that appellant advertiser modified two outdoor signs without first obtaining new permits from the department in violation of Iowa Admin. Code r. 761-117.6(5) (1999) and revoked the advertiser's sign permits. The advertiser appealed, arguing the department exceeded its rulemaking authority by cancelling the permits. The Polk County District Court (Iowa) affirmed the revocation. The advertiser appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the advertiser contended, inter alia, that the department exceeded its statutory authority by promulgating a rule requiring the department to revoke permits granted under Iowa Code ch. 306C when the advertiser modified two nonconforming signs without first seeking a new permit. The appellate court concluded that the department could conclude it was empowered to enact a rule governing the reconstruction or modification of nonconforming signs. Although ch. 306C did not in fact expressly grant rulemaking authority, the court found that several other statutory sections inherently provided the department with sufficient authority to enact regulations controlling the maintenance of nonconforming signs. The court also found that Iowa Admin Code r. 761-117.6(5) was also compatible with federal regulations. After finding the rule was within the department's authority, the court found that the advertiser's two signs were in fact illegally modified. The dimensions, size, and number of posts of both signs increased. The alterations and additions in the case were too extensive to constitute de minimis changes or a mere continuation of the existing sign.</SPAN></P>

Opponents of a tax on racetracks appeal the district court's order granting summary judgment to the Treasurer of the State of Iowa on their constitutional equal protection claim.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant racetracks challenged legislation under Iowa Code &sect; 99F.11 that significantly increased the tax on racetracks, but not on riverboats. The Iowa District Court for Polk County granted summary judgment to appellee, the Treasurer of the State of Iowa, and upheld the unequal taxing scheme, finding the state had a legitimate interest in promoting the riverboat industry and the economy of river towns. The racetracks appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue in this case centered around the differential tax rate for racetracks and riverboats. The legislature adopted a higher wagering tax rate on racetracks under Iowa Code &sect; 99F.11(1). The result was a 36 percent tax on gross receipts for racetracks while riverboats had a twenty-two percent tax on gross receipts. The appellate court found no rational connection between the discriminatory tax and the alleged intent of promoting riverboat history. The appellate court could not justify the tax based on the fact racetracks operated on land whereas riverboats operated on water. The tax was not designed to force the racetracks to make up for past tax breaks. It appeared the purpose behind the discriminatory legislation was simply to allow the state to collect increased revenue from racetrack slots despite the fact they, like the riverboats, derived most of their revenue from slot machines. Where an additional tax based on gross receipts was imposed on only one member of the same class, the tax violated the federal and state equal protection clauses. Consequently, the portion of Iowa Code &sect; 99F.11 that imposed a higher tax rate upon the racetracks was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the state on the racetracks' equal protection claim. However, the appellate court concluded the district court properly denied the state's motion for summary judgment based on the state's assertion the district court did not have authority to grant relief in the case.</SPAN></P>

The court declared that the fees were an illegal tax and enjoined the city from collecting the fees. The court awarded the builders attorney's fees. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by invalidating the fee because it was authorized under the city's home-rule power. The supreme court disagreed. The home rule power, while giving local governments broad authority to promote the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and convenience of its residents, did not bestow such broad powers with respect to the financing of local government activities. The city could charge a fee to cover the cost of regulation or the cost of providing a service, but beyond that the municipality must have had specific authorization from the legislature to raise revenue for general city purposes. The parks fee was a tax because it was a charge to pay the cost of government without regard to the special benefits conferred. The fee was not compensation for a direct service to the developer or homebuilder paying the fee, nor was it intended to cover the administrative costs of the city. To the contrary the fee was a measure to raise revenue for public infrastructure. Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court ruled the powers transferred under the challenged statutes that clearly encroached upon judicial power included those enabling the ALJ's to (1) reconsider defendants sentence in the manner provided in Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 902.4, 903.2 (1999); (2) sentence defendants to a jail term while continuing probation; (3) revoke probation and require defendants to serve a lesser sentence than that imposed by the district court; and (4) revoke probation and place defendants on work release.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant tire company filed a motion to quash an inspection warrant in the Polk County District Court (Iowa). The appellee Iowa Occupational Safety and Health Administration (IOSHA) resisted the motion and filed a petition asking the district court to hold the company in contempt for refusing to allow the inspection. The court denied the motion to quash and found the company in contempt. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued, inter alia, that the district court erred in denying the motion to quash the inspection warrant because there was no probable cause for the inspection warrant. The supreme court disagreed. The application for the warrant signed by the deputy labor commissioner stated, among other things, that the division of labor received a complaint which met the requirements of Iowa Code &sect; 88.6(5). The complaint was from a representative of the company's employees. The signed complaint alleged that at the time of filing, the hazards alleged in the complaint existed at the plant. The labor administrator determined there were reasonable grounds to believe that a violation or violations of safety and health standards existed at the plant, which threatened physical harm to the employees. Therefore, the district court did not err in finding probable cause to issue an administrative search warrant.</SPAN></P>

A mistrial was declared on the first trial date, which was 90 days after the trial information had been filed. Trial was rescheduled for the next day. The Iowa District Court for Marshall County denied defendant's motion for dismissal based on his right to be tried within 90 days from the filing of the trial information.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant reduced $ 25 in court costs to pennies, wrapped them in socks and barbed wire, and sent them to the Marshall County clerk of court in a crudely-taped box. Alarmed over the suspicious-looking box, court officials called in the bomb squad, and the courthouse was evacuated for four hours. Defendant filed several pretrial motions including a demand of the right to a speedy trial. On appeal, the issue was whether the district court properly exercised its discretion under Iowa R. Crim. P. 27(2)(b) in denying defendant's motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds. The supreme court noted it interpreted Rule 27(2)(b) to require dismissal for failure to comply with the rule's 90 day deadline, unless the defendant had waived speedy trial, the delay was attributable to the defendant, or other &quot;good cause&quot; existed for the delay. Moreover, the question was not whether the delay was great or small, but whether the reason given justified departure from the rule at all. Here, although the delay was only for one day, the State could not provide a strong reason for the delay. Therefore, the district court failed to properly exercise its limited discretion under the rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was reversed, and the case was remanded to the district court for dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the property owners argued, inter alia, that the amendment was a violation of the county's comprehensive zoning plan and constituted illegal spot zoning. Because the county board's action was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary or capricious, the court held that the trial court correctly denied the property owners' petition for writ of certiorari. The appellate court found that the amendment did constitute spot zoning, however, there was a reasonable basis for making a distinction between the fairgrounds and the property owners' land. There had been a unique dedication of the fairground property because of the various uses and activities held for nearly 50 years prior to the adoption of the county's first zoning ordinance. The racetrack events were an extension of prior nonconforming arena events at the fair. There was a reasonable basis for treating the fairgrounds differently from the surrounding property based on the character of the fairgrounds and its suitability to fair-time events. Consequently, the amendment did not violate the comprehensive zoning plan.</SPAN></P>

Thus, appellant failed to appeal within 30 days of the district court's ruling on appellant's application to adjudicate law points. The supreme court determined that the appeal was untimely because: (1) the Rule 179(b) motion was not an appropriate challenge to the adjudication of law points ruling, so appellant's filing of the Rule 179(b) motion did not toll the time for appeal; and (2) the time for appeal expired long before the Rule 179(b) ruling.</SPAN></P>

Iowa Code &sect; 123.47 (1999) provided an exemption for beer given or dispensed to a person under legal age within a private home and with the knowledge, presence, and consent of the parent or guardian. The trial court held that the defendant, having attained age 18, the age of majority, was her own guardian, and accordingly, Iowa Code &sect; 123.47(2) (1999) did not prohibit her from drinking alcoholic beverages inside a private home. The appellate court held that Iowa Code &sect; 123.47 (1999) was required to be liberally construed to accomplish the objective of protecting persons under the legal age from the troublesome consequences of alcohol consumption. The legislature had the power to set the age for alcohol consumption differently than the age of majority.

The supreme court held that the trial court had not erred because: (1) the nature of the liberty interest impacted, and the decision by fit, married parents to oppose visitation by third parties outside their nuclear family was one that had historically been protected by the highest level of scrutiny as the right to parent one's children was a fundamental liberty interest; and (2) it placed the best interest of the child decision squarely in the hands of a judge without first according primacy to the parents' own estimation of their child's best interests, and without a threshold finding of unfitness, the statute effectively substituted sentimentality for constitutionality; it exalted the socially desirable goal of grandparent-grandchild bonding over the constitutionally recognized right of parents to decide with whom their children would associate.</SPAN></P>

The employer cross-appealed the trial court's denial of its motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that: (1) the trial court erred in concluding that the award of front pay damages was subject to a damages cap under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1981a; (2) the trial court erred in refusing to allocate compensatory damages under the Iowa Civil Rights Act (ICRA) and punitive damages under Title VII; (3) the damages cap was unconstitutional; and (4) the trial court erred in dismissing her claim of tortious infliction of emotional distress. The instant court held that the trial court erred in concluding that front pay was subject to the damages cap and in concluding that the employee was not entitled to uncapped compensatory damages in the amount of $ 527,872 under the ICRA and an additional $ 300,000 in uncapped punitive damages under Title VII. The trial court correctly awarded $ 14,605 in liquidated damages, and it properly dismissed the employee's claim of tortious infliction of emotional distress. The damages cap was constitutional.

The case was remanded with directions.</SPAN></P>

Although the Board of Professional Ethics and Conduct (board) had also charged a violation of Iowa Code Prof. Resp. DR 1-102(A)(1), (4), and (5), the commission made no findings as to that charge. The supreme court concluded the board did not establish a violation of Iowa Code Prof. Resp. DR 7-107 because a reasonable fact finder would not conclude that the statement in question was reasonably likely to affect the fairness of the proceeding. The court held that the board did establish a violation of Iowa Code Prof. Resp.

Mother challenged the removal, claiming the statute was unconstitutional. The juvenile court rejected the claim, but the Iowa Court of Appeals granted writ of certiorari and found the statute unconstitutional. Both the mother and the agency appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother claimed Iowa Code &sect; 232.78 was unconstitutional because it violated the Warrant Clause of U.S. Const. amend IV and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and the Due Process Clauses of both constitutions. The juvenile court disagreed, but the court of appeals found that emergency removal under the statute was subject to the Warrant Clause, and that the juvenile court acted illegally by not requiring an application for such order to be made on oath or affirmation. The court vacated the court of appeals' decision and annulled the writ of certiorari. The court held that the mother had no standing on Fourth Amendment grounds because the removal order did not result in a search or seizure of her property. The court also found that the statute did not deprive the mother of due process. Given the emergency nature of temporary removal applications, a reasonably prompt post-removal hearing met the twin goals of protecting the child's safety while preserving the mother's liberty interest. The court found no basis to find the statute unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police obtained an arrest warrant for defendant. The police forced their way into defendant's motel room to execute the arrest warrant after coming in contact with the suspect at the door to her room. While inside, police viewed a baggie containing marijuana residue in the trash can in plain view and seized it. Defendant appealed the denial of her motion to suppress the baggie evidence. The arrest warrant did not give police the same authority of access to a suspect's home that a search warrant authorized. The appellate court held that when defendant attempted to comply with the demands of the police and exited her room, police could not force her back inside to make the arrest. The arrest warrant did provide authority to enter when the knock and announce provisions of Iowa Code &sect; 804.15 were met. However, compliance by defendant destroyed that authority unless exigent circumstances existed or some other exception to the search warrant requirement applied. As the greater weight of the testimony did not support any exigency theory, the police entry into defendant's motel room was not constitutionally justified.</SPAN></P>

Fixtures held parts firmly in place with proper clearances so operations such as welding or drilling could be performed on the parts. Appellant acted as a design consultant, using information obtained from its clients, who then used the plans and specifications from appellant to actually built the fixtures. After a contested-case hearing, appellee determined appellant performed professional engineering services for the public within the meaning and broad definition of Iowa Code &sect; 542B.2(8). Appellee concluded the services performed by appellant and offered to the public were creative work which required engineering education, training, and experience in the application of special knowledge of the mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences. This type of fixture design involved the safeguarding of health and property, since inadequate fixture design could result in damage to the part being fabricated, and, in rare cases, injury to the person operating the machine. The supreme court stated that the scope of the statute was a matter of public policy and therefore within the province of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

Code r. 761-117.1 ordered appellant motel to remove a motel sign located within 660 feet of a primary highway on a narrow easement over a neighboring owner's land. The Iowa District Court for Henry County judgment affirmed the order. Appellant requested review of the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant motel owned land next to a restaurant owned by a different entity with a partial overlap of ownership by common shareholders. Appellant obtained a narrow easement over the restaurant land to construct the motel sign. Prior to sign construction, the DOT told appellant the proposed sign would not be permitted under applicable statutes and agency rules prohibiting signs within 660 feet of a highway. Appellant constructed the sign anyway. After notification and a hearing DOT ordered appellant to remove the sign. The DOT determined the sign did not qualify under the exception for an &quot;on premises&quot; sign under &sect; 306C.10, .11 and Iowa Admin. Code r. 761-117.1 because (1) the sign was not on appellant's property; (2) the easement was only large enough to accommodate the sign; and (3) even if the respective properties were part of the same subdivision, they could not be considered &quot;one property&quot; under Rule 761-117.1(1) because they did not share a common access to a public street or highway. The DOT determined these issues as fact issues. Rule 761-117.1(1) was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The DOT's fact findings were supported by substantial evidence. The sign was not an on-premise sign under the exception to the rules prohibiting signs within 660 feet of a highway. An on-premise sign was not to be located on a narrow strip of land that could not reasonably be used for a purpose related to the advertised activity other than signing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of third degree sexual abuse and incarcerated. The State filed a petition under the Sexually Violent Predator Act (Act), Iowa Code ch. 229A. Appellant's motion to dismiss on various constitutional grounds was denied. The Iowa District Court for Polk County held that appellant was a sexually violent predator subject to civil commitment. Appellant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed the Act violated several federal and state constitutional rights. Those rights depended on whether the Act was civil or criminal in nature. The supreme court held that it was civil in nature because, inter alia, (1) the legislature intended to create a civil commitment scheme; (2) Iowa's act was nearly identical to Kansas' Sexually Violent Predator Act, which the United States Supreme Court had upheld as civil; (3) criminal conviction was not a prerequisite for commitment; (4) confinement would end once the inmate was no longer dangerous; and (5) inmates were under the care of the department of human services, not corrections. Thus, what was intended as a civil remedy had not been transformed into a criminal penalty. Since protections against ex post facto laws and double jeopardy only applied to criminal proceedings, they were not implicated. The Act served a compelling state interest to protect the public and was narrowly drawn, so it did not violate appellant's due process or equal protection rights. For a lack of briefing, appellant's claim that the Act was vague as applied to him was waived and he lacked standing to make a facial challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a traffic stop, police officers discovered drugs in appellant's vehicle. The trial court denied appellant's motion to suppress evidence seized during his vehicle's warrantless search, and convicted him. The appellate court reversed appellant's keeping a vehicle for using controlled substances conviction. On appeal, the court reversed appellant's convictions and remanded the case for a new trial, holding that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of appellant's passenger's acquittal. The court held that defendant's relevancy objection to the evidence was sufficient to question the evidence's inadmissibility. The evidence's impact was substantial because the State's case's strength depended largely on whether the jury would believe the passenger's testimony. The court affirmed the reversal of appellant's keeping a vehicle for using controlled substances conviction. Appellant's counsel was ineffective for failing to request an instruction on the requirement that appellant's vehicle was used for the &quot;substantial purpose&quot; of drug activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a college student who downloaded child pornography from the internet for a research paper.

The Iowa Code &sect; 728.7 facial vagueness claim was waived for failure to raise in the district court that defendant's right to possess the pornography was protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. Defendant's ineffective counsel assistance claim for not raising U.S. Const. amend. I rights was preserved. The court disavowed the prior decision in Hunter to the extent that it held that future guilty pleas waived vague-as-applied constitutional challenges.

The word &quot;preparatory&quot; referred to indictable offenses and not preparatory activities. The offenses were limited to those committed for financial gain on a continuing basis that were punishable as an indictable offense. The court analogized to Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act definitions in defining &quot;preparatory&quot; and &quot;continuing.&quot; There was no double jeopardy or merger of the sentences for the specific drug activities of delivering cocaine into the sentence for the ongoing activity, since the legislature intended punishment to be cumulative, as the statutes served differing purposes.

Plaintiff failed to produce substantial evidence that the injury was caused by an instrumentality under defendant's exclusive control, thus res ipsa loquitur doctrine was not applicable. There was sufficient evidence to support a &quot;proper lookout&quot; instruction. Iowa Code &sect; 668.14(1) was not unconstitutional. Defendant's cross-examination of plaintiff's expert witness was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Admission of settlement evidence was reversible error. There was no factual basis to support admitting evidence on the issue of bias or prejudice or as to identity of released party. Trial court did not make any other evidentiary or instructional errors. Case remanded for new trial.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was stopped in her vehicle as she was attempting to leave a known methamphetamine lab house. The vehicle was backing out of the property without its lights on.

The court reversed and remanded for a new trial, concluding that the search violated Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 8. A search incident to a traffic citation was not constitutionally valid, and while appellant's presence in an area of drug dealing and her flight from police gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that she might have been involved in illegal activity, these facts did not rise to the level of probable cause to believe that appellant had actually committed a crime.

The court held plaintiff failed to establish defendants had a public or private way to the land at issue. The court found the creek could not be crossed by farm machinery. There was no evidence that the cost of constructing a bridge or culvert over the creek was reasonable. The court held the state condemnation procedures did not violate plaintiff's due process rights. The application for condemnation contained the information required by Iowa Code &sect; 6B.3.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment and sentence imposed by the district court following his conviction for involuntary manslaughter. He claimed that portion of the sentence which required him to pay $ 150,000 in victim restitution pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 910.3(B) (Supp. 1997) violated his rights under the excessive fines, double jeopardy, and due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions. He also argued the district court failed to exercise its discretion in imposing the restitution award. On appeal, the court stated that the restitution award under Iowa Code &sect; 910.3(B) (Supp. 1997) did not violate the excessive fines clauses of U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The court concluded that the restitution award was not grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense of involuntary manslaughter. The court also stated that it determined a restitution award did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the federal constitution, and that Iowa Code &sect; 910.3(B)(3) (Supp. 1997) did not result in a denial of due process. Further, the award was mandatory once an offender's felonious actions result in the loss of human life. Thus, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the park ranger that stopped defendant had authority to do so under either Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 321.285 or 461A.3, because defendant's speed of driving posed a safety risk to campers, although it was within the posted limits.

V, and prosecutorial misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an attorney, was convicted in a bench trial of first- and second-degree theft, third-degree theft, money laundering, perjury, first- and second-degree fraudulent practice, falsifying a public document, and forgery. Rather than contesting the factual basis of the charges, he asserted the defenses of insanity and diminished capacity. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the rejection of the defenses. Evidence of defendant's character was not dispositive. The principle of judicial estoppel was not applicable to the case, and it was proper to deny defendant's motion to dismiss on that ground. The prohibition on double jeopardy was not violated. Defendant was not denied a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct. The sentences were reversed and remanded because reasons were not provided for the imposition of consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed because there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict, and the prohibition on double jeopardy was not violated. The sentences were vacated and remanded for resentencing because the trial court did not provide reasons for its decision to impose consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Iowa Code &sect; 902.12 (statute) violated constitutional principles of separation of powers, it was an unconstitutional bill of attainder, it constituted cruel and unusual punishment, and it violated her equal protection rights. The 100 percent provision in the statute was clearly part of the legislature's constitutional authority. The parole system was a creature of the legislature. The parole and work-release restrictions did not impinge on any constitutional authority of the executive branch. The statute, which did not impose punishment based on a defendant's status or without trial, was not a bill of attainder. The statute did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because it did not violate the disproportionate punishment prong of the test. The court found there was a rational distinction between second-degree robbery and other forcible felonies not included in the 100 percent provision of Iowa Code &sect; 902.12; the statute passed a rational basis test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged damages awarded for breach of contract when it failed to deliver corn under hedge-to-arrive contracts. Appellant claimed the contracts were illegal under Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1-25, and that appellee had repudiated them by making unreasonable demands for assurances. The contracts between the parties anticipated the actual delivery of corn by appellant to appellee, and so fell within the statutory exemption legalizing cash forward contracts. Inverse market conditions, combined with public statements that HTA contracts were unenforceable, created a jury question whether appellee had a reasonable basis for insecurity about appellant's willingness to perform its obligations. The fact that appellee demanded assurances requiring action beyond contract performance did not render its demand unreasonable. Appellant failed to preserve a parol evidence issue for appeal, so that claim was not considered. The jury properly decided that appellant had breached its contracts by failing to give appellee adequate assurances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment for appellee was affirmed. The evidence raised questions of fact concerning the reasonableness of appellee's demand for assurances of performance on the parties' hedge-to-arrive contracts, so the issue was properly submitted to the jury.

Evid. 5.804(b)(3) did not apply to the paramour's statements in the police report; that he stated that he was the disciplinarian and he believed defendant loved the child did not so far tend to subject him to criminal liability such that a reasonable person would not have made them unless they were true.</SPAN></P>
