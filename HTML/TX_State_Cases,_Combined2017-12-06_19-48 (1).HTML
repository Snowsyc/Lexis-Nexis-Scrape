<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the 272nd District Court, Brazos County, Texas, which convicted him of possession of a prohibited weapon, namely a short-barrel shotgun.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 46.01, 46.05 (Supp. 2008) were unconstitutional. He contended that these provisions failed to explain how a barrel should have been measured, which resulted in an arbitrary enforcement. In this case, the police measured the barrel of the shotgun at issue with a tape measure and found it to be over 15 inches long. A measurement done at trial with a dowel resulted in a length of over 16 inches long. Both lengths fell below the legal 18-inch minimum. Therefore, defendant failed to show that the statutes were unconstitutional as to him in his situation. Next, defendant's motion for a directed verdict was properly denied because there was no fatal variance between the indictment and the evidence at trial based on the differing lengths of the shotgun's barrel. He was charged with possessing a short-barrel shotgun with a barrel length less than 18 inches, and that was what the evidence showed. He was not in any danger of being prosecuted again for the same crime either. As such, the variance was immaterial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The condition of community supervision at issue required a tracking leg monitor, with a 6:00 am to 10:00 pm schedule. This was the only condition which the State alleged defendant violated. Defendant admitted to a community supervision officer that he had violated the electronic monitoring condition of his community supervision in at least two respects. Defendant also conceded in cross-examination that he had violated the electronic monitoring condition of his community supervision. Defendant argued that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.072 was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court ruled that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because the statute incorporated a &quot;reasonable person&quot; standard. The statute prohibited a person from engaging in conduct that would cause a reasonable person to fear bodily injury or death to himself or another or an offense against his property. Also, based on defendant's own testimony and admissions, the appellate court could not say that the circuit court abused its discretion by revoking defendant's community supervision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cross-petitions were filed seeking discretionary review of a judgment from the Third Court of Appeals (Texas), which denied pretrial habeas corpus applications challenging indictments for Texas Election Code violations and money laundering charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictments charged the knowing acceptance of political contributions in excess of contribution limits from several corporations on behalf of a state political action committee and the subsequent transfer of the funds to a national political party committee. The transfer was made by check. The court of appeals concluded that the money laundering statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 34.02(a)(2), did not include checks among the funds defined in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 34.01(2). The court held that the vagueness challenge to the money laundering statute was an as-applied challenge, not a facial challenge; thus, it was not cognizable in a pretrial habeas appeal. The Election Code provisions allegedly violated, Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 253.003, 253.094, which prohibited unauthorized contributions as defined in Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 251.001, were not facially unconstitutional. In light of Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 253.096, specifying the circumstances under which corporations could make contributions on a measure, &sect;&sect; 253.003, 253.094 were neither vague nor overbroad under the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, sufficiently important interest standard applicable to contribution limits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court denied his motion to quash the indictment, appellant pled guilty to felony theft. He claimed that the definition of &quot;deception&quot; in Tex.

Intent was not required in &sect; 31.01 because it was in Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 31.03, and taken as a whole, the statutory scheme required intent. Appellant contended that trans-county aggregation denied him due process because it hindered his ability to prepare a defense, as several complainants and witnesses resided outside the area. Nothing in the record substantiated his position that he was unable to present a defense because of any particular witness's or complainant's unavailability or location.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of owning an adult arcade without a permit in violation of Houston, Tex., Rev. Ordinances ch. 28, art. II, &sect; 91 (1997). The County Criminal Court at Law No. 12, Harris County, Texas, assessed punishment at confinement in county jail for 120 days and a $2,000 fine. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers conducted an on-site investigation of defendant's video rental store and adult arcade. There were adult videos available for rent and numerous private viewing booths in the adult arcade section. Defendant was indicted for operating an adult arcade without a permit. On appeal of his conviction, defendant claimed the trial court erred by granting the State's motion in limine to prevent him from presenting evidence on the primary-business defense and the effect of the 50/50 rule. Defendant's counsel did not seek to elicit testimony regarding the primary business defense or 50/50 rule during cross-examination, nor did he call any witnesses or present any evidence during the defense's case-in-chief. Because defendant did not offer the evidence during trial and made an untimely offer of proof after the jury charge was read, any error in excluding the evidence was not preserved for review under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1; Tex. R. Evid. 103.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the police department's pleas to the jurisdiction and denied the business's temporary injunction. The appellate court held the trial court correctly concluded it lacked jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment or enjoin enforcement of Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his motion to set aside the information was denied, defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere pursuant to a plea-bargain agreement. The trial court deferred finding defendant guilty, placed him on deferred adjudication community supervision for a period of six months, and assessed a fine, court costs, and community service. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to set aside the information because the offense of racing on a highway was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court ruled that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion. The information tracked the language of the racing on a highway statute. Defendant had not explained how the alleged lack of notice prevented him from investigating the offense and preparing a defense, other than to state that the statute was itself too vague. Defendant argued that the racing statute was impermissibly vague as to everyone, and defendant wholly failed to explain how the law was too vague as applied to his particular conduct. In the absence of an &quot;as applied&quot; argument, defendant had failed to show that the racing statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was in the business of storing natural gas liquids in underground salt dome caverns and pumped in brine to displace the gases; when gases had to be pumped into the caverns, brine had to be removed, and the brine ponds were used to retain displaced brine for future reuse. Appellant had previously received the exemption at issue, but appellees issued a negative use determination on the basis that the brine-pond system was not 100% pollution-control property under &sect; 11.31 and 30 Tex. Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 17.1-17.20) (2008). The district court affirmed the TCEQ decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged a decision of the 326th District Court, Taylor County (Texas), which, on a petition filed by appellee Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, terminated the father's parental rights. The father filed a notice of appeal and statement of points, which included the claim that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.405(b), (i) was unconstitutional. The trial court determined this claim was not frivolous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.405 was unconstitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed. In light of the procedural safeguards, including under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 13.003 and Tex. R. Civ. P. 5, the father did not show how the statute always caused an erroneous deprivation of parental rights. If counsel needed a reporter's record to prepare a statement of points, the trial court was authorized to extend the Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.405(b) 15-day deadline. Therefore, the statute did not deprive an indigent parent the ability to prosecute a meaningful appeal. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.405(b) and (i) was not unconstitutional on its face. The father did not present a valid challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence for the trial court's termination order. Because the father did not avail himself of the procedural safeguards in the statute and did not identify any meritorious claim, &sect; 263.405(b), (i) did not operate to violate the father's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The 79th Judicial District Court, Jim Wells County, Texas, denied his writ of habeas corpus, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the phrase &quot;holds himself or herself out as a lawyer&quot; in Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect;38.122(a) (Vernon 1994) was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague on its face. He cited no circumstances under which the statute was overbroad. Where the regulation of the practice of law, was a subject of legitimate and substantial government interest, the mere fact that regulation had an incidental impact on speech was not sufficient to render the statute invalid. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague merely because the words or terms were not defined. The court interpreted undefined terms by their plain meaning and within the context in which they were used. It was relatively simple to conclude that a person who presented himself or herself as a specialist in law who was in the profession of advising as to the prosecution or defense of lawsuits or other legal rights and obligations was in violation of the law, if the person did so with the expectation of being paid and the person was not licensed by a proper authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A man came into a shop and robbed the female shopkeeper at knifepoint. A female customer came in during the robbery. The robber stabbed the customer with the knife as he was forcing her into a bathroom to lock her up with the shopkeeper. In the meantime, the shopkeeper called the police on a cordless telephone. Both the shopkeeper and the customer identified defendant as the robber at trial. On appeal, the appellate court found that the jury instruction did inform the jury that it was not to consider the manner in which the parole law could be applied to defendant. The appellate court assumed that the jury followed that instruction. Further, defendant did not show that the jury discussed, considered, or attempted to apply what it was told about good conduct time and parole. Also, defendant did not show that there was any indication that the jury was confused about the possible application of good conduct time. Thus, the appellate court concluded that there was no demonstration of a violation of due process &quot;as applied&quot; in the jury instruction given by the trial court. Additionally, defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Travis County, 261st Judicial District, Texas, granted in part and denied in part a plea to the jurisdiction asserted by appellant state officials following the appellate court's partial remand. Appellee taxpayers sought declaratory relief challenging the legality of prospective state expenditures on the basis that the underlying appropriations violated Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 22(a). The state officials appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court agreed with the state officials that the expiration of the 06-07 fiscal biennium was fatal to the taxpayers' standing as taxpayers to seek declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent expenditures under 06-07 appropriations. The allegedly illegal expenditures that conferred standing on the taxpayers to challenge 06-07 appropriations had already been spent. The parties agreed that to prevail on their causes of action regarding the legislature's use of state personal income (SPI) to determine the estimated rate of growth of the state's economy, the taxpayers had to plead and prove that such use was arbitrary in light of the requirements of Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 22. The appellate court found that the text of article VIII, &sect; 22(a) did not foreclose the legislature's use of SPI to calculate the estimated rate of growth of the state's economy. The use of SPI was not so lacking in guiding rules and principles related to article VIII, &sect; 22's directives as to be arbitrary and unconstitutional. The legislature's failure to provide a &quot;feedback&quot; mechanism to reconcile estimated SPI growth with actual SPI growth during the biennium did not violate article VIII, &sect; 22.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and rendered dismissing all of the taxpayers' causes of action for want of jurisdiction, with the exception of their claims, added in their second amended petition, based on the yet-unchallenged theory that the specific amount of 08-09 appropriations from non-dedicated state tax revenues had exceeded the 08-09 spending cap.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred because attempted DWI was not a crime because it did not fit within the legislative statutory scheme and was inconsistent with the purposes of the penal code. The State argued that the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion for instructed verdict acquitting her of DWI. The appellate court found that because the State did not file a notice of appeal pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 25.2, its point was not properly before the appellate court. The trial court was put on notice of defendant's complaint that attempted DWI was not a legally cognizable offense. By providing that proof of a culpable mental state was not required for DWI, the legislature made it clear it did not intend for the attempt statute,&nbsp;Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.09(4) (Vernon Supp. 2002), to apply to DWI. Convicting a person with attempted DWI would endanger the public because a defendant convicted of attempted DWI would not face the automatic driver's license suspension as would a defendant convicted of DWI. Applying the attempt statute to DWI would lead to the absurd result of vastly different consequences for essentially the same conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect; 7.177(a)(5). Defendant filed a motion to quash the information, alleging that the provision of the Administrative Code under which he was charged was void because the Texas Legislature unconstitutionally delegated authority to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), an executive-branch agency, in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers. The trial court granted the motion. The State appealed, and the court of appeals reversed. The reviewing court held that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 382.018(a), which delegated to the TCEQ the power to prohibit or control the outdoor burning of waste, was a constitutional delegation of Legislative authority. Since the Legislature had declared a policy and set standards and limitations on the authority delegated to the TCEQ that were capable of reasonable application, provided guidance, and limited discretion, it had not unconstitutionally delegated to the TCEQ authority more properly attached to the Legislature and therefore, there was no violation of the separation of powers principle of Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged on February 21, 2001. A jury trial began on August 7, 2001. The trial court declared a mistrial the following day. The trial court's docket entries indicated defendant decided to go to trial by an order dated October 18, 2002. The case was reset for February 3, 2003. The State sought to amend the indictment on January 17, 2003, the same day defendant moved to dismiss for violation of the act. The court held a hearing to consider defendant's motion, where it acknowledged the unconstitutionality of the act. The trial court's order dismissing the case only mentioned the act, it did not mention the federal or state constitutional guarantees to a speedy trial as a basis for the trial court's decision. On appeal, the State contended the trial court erred by granting the motion based on an unconstitutional statute. Because defendant's motion to dismiss raised only a violation of the act as grounds for setting aside the indictment and the trial court's dismissal was based solely on the act, and the act was invalid and could not provide the basis for relief, the trial court erred in granting the motion to set aside the indictment on this ground.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee contended that the trial court erred in transferring the case to Travis County because it was not a county of proper venue and because under Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 410.252(b)(1), venue was mandatory in Maverick County as the county nearest his residence at the time of his injury. The appellate court noted that the employee presented no affidavits or other evidence establishing Maverick County as his residence. There was no provision in &sect; 410.252 for venue in the Texas county nearest a non-resident's plea of residence. The trial court was required to transfer the suit to a county of proper venue. The Maverick County district court had jurisdiction to transfer the suit and was required to do so. The insurer presented undisputed evidence that its principal place of business was located in Travis County. Therefore, Travis County was a county of proper venue under the general provision and the trial court did not err in transferring the suit to Travis County. The employee was able to pursue remedies under the workers' compensation act comparable to those available under common law and obtain a judgment on his claims. The statute did not deprive the employee of due process.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. A detective testified that defendant was informed he was not under arrest and was &quot;free to leave&quot; about thirty times during the two interviews. The detective personally told defendant he was &quot;free to go&quot; six times during their forty-minute interview. Defendant was never restrained or handcuffed, and he was left alone in the interview room with the door open much of the time, with access to the building exits; he was questioned by only one detective at a time. The detective stated that during the entire time defendant was at the police station he was not under arrest or in custody, and was free to leave any time. Defendant left the room and sat with his brother in the lobby area in between the two interviews. The brother walked outside the police station to smoke several times. Further, defendant was, in fact, not arrested after his confession but was transported home with his brother. Defendant acknowledged several times that he was not under arrest and was free to leave.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the 238th District Court, Midland County, Texas, convicting him of four counts of sexual assault of a child and three counts of indecency with a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After finding all of the enhancement paragraphs true, the jury assessed defendant's punishment in all counts at life imprisonment, to be served concurrently, except that the life sentences in counts IV and V were to be served consecutively with the life sentences in counts I, III, VI, VII, and VIII. The appellate court interpreted defendant's argument as to his first issue as being Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 22.011 and 21.11 (2011) violated his rights to due process and due course of law, because they did not allow for the defense of deception by the victim as to his or her age. The appellate court found that the fact that the statute might be invalid in some situations did not establish that there were no circumstances in which the statute could be held valid. Also, defendant's sentence did not constitute a disproportionate sentence nor one that constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant had previously been convicted of the offense of indecency with a child. Two of the life sentences were to run consecutively with five others that run concurrently.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the survivors of an employee, brought suit against defendant employer in the 11th District Court, Harris County, Texas, alleging that their decedent died of asbestos contracted through workplace exposure. The employer filed a motion to dismiss the survivors' claims for failure to provide an adequate physician report under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 90.003 (2011). The trial denied the motion, and the employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee had severe dementia and lung problems that prevented his treating physician from conducting pulmonary function tests on the employee as required in order to pursue a claim for asbestos injury under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 90.003(a)(2) or 90.010(f)(1)(B), because proceeding under either of those sections required pulmonary function testing. The court held that the survivors could not rely on a pulmonary function test taken by the employer years earlier that showed no impairment and was not used by the treating physician in arriving at his diagnosis. The physician opined that the employee's clinical history and other diagnostic testing, coupled with meticulous postmortem analysis of pulmonary tissue, confirmed his diagnosis of asbestosis. The court held that &sect; 90.010(f)(1)(B)(ii)'s requirement of pulmonary function testing was unconstitutional as applied to the survivors because the requirement, enacted after the employee's death, would retroactively extinguish the survivors' asbestos-related injury claims in violation of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the MDL pretrial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An information alleged that defendant had violated Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07(a)(4) and (7) by making telephone calls and leaving voice messages for his former wife. After he was convicted, defendant contended that &sect; 42.07(a)(4) and (7) were void for vagueness on their face, in violation of U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV. An act was void for vagueness if its prohibitions were not clearly defined. The subsections at issue did implicate U.S. Const. amend. I because what was &quot;annoying,&quot; &quot;embarrassing,&quot; or even &quot;alarming&quot; could have been protected speech; also, &quot;electronic communications&quot; could have encompassed some talk radio and television programming. Next, the offense was not limited to a person with the sole intent to engage in conduct not protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. The requirement that the communication be by telephone, even if combined with the requirement that a person have the intent to annoy, alarm, or embarrass, did not create a sufficient nexus to overcome the vagueness problem. Finally, the term &quot;repeated&quot; was unconstitutionally vague because it did not define how many communications were prohibited or over what time period the communications were not to be made.</SPAN></P>

Whether a dancer had violated the six foot zone or remained, as the trial court noted, 5 feet and 11 and 15/16 inches away from the nearest patron was a matter for the State to prove. The regulation itself is not vague. Further, because &sect; XXII(a)(13) required the owner or enterprise operator to clearly mark the six foot zone, in practice, law enforcement officers were able to make a clear determination as to whether a violation occurred.</SPAN></P>

Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.46 (Supp. 2004-05), repealed by Act of April 30, 2003, ch. 1274, &sect;&nbsp;26(b)(4), 2003 Tex. Gen. Laws 3611, 4139 (effective April 1, 2005), was incorrect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies sought to recover taxes they claimed were unlawfully assessed. The trial court granted the Comptroller summary judgment and the court affirmed on appeal. The court rejected the companies' claim that the Comptroller's interpretation of the retaliatory tax scheme, specifically Tex. Ins.

Laws 3611, 4139 (effective April 1, 2005), required title insurers to remit all of the premium tax to the Comptroller, the statute did not place all of the financial burden on the insurer. The Comptroller's interpretation and rule did not lead to absurd conclusions but protected insurers from being unfairly held liable for taxes they did not pay or owe. The court concluded that the premium tax and retaliatory tax scheme and the Comptroller's application thereof were constitutional and did not violate equal protection considerations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, numerous low-income women, sued defendant, the Texas Commissioner of Health (the State), challenging certain restrictions the State's Medicaid program placed on abortion funding under the Texas Medical Assistance Program (TMAP), codified at Tex. Hum. Res. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 32.001 to -.052. The Court of Appeals for the Third District of Texas ruled in favor of the low-income women. The State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After Congress passed the Hyde Amendment to Medicaid in 1976, the current version of which was the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001, Pub. L. No. 106-554, &sect; 1(a)(1) (enacting H.R. 5656), 114 Stat. 2763, Appendix A, H.R. 5656, Tit. V, &sect;&sect; 508, 509, federal funds could no longer be used for medically necessary abortions, unless the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest or placed the woman in danger of death. Texas participated in the Medicaid program through the Texas Medical Assistance Program (TMAP), Tex. Hum. Res. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 32.001-.052. When federal matching funds became unavailable, the State stopped funding medically necessary abortions that did not comply with the Hyde Amendment. The low-income women claimed that this funding restriction violated the Texas Constitution's Equal Rights Amendment and Equal Protection Clause. The appellate court held that the funding restrictions did not discriminate on the basis of sex and were rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. Thus, they did not violate the Texas Equal Rights Amendment, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3a, the Texas Equal Protection Clause, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, or a constitutional right to privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from an order of the Criminal District Court No. 4, Dallas County (Texas), which granted defendant's motion to quash indictments after finding Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 365.012(j) (Supp. 2004) unconstitutional on its face or as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for three counts of illegal commercial dumping of more than 200 pounds of solid waste. Defendant alleged that &sect; 365.012(j) was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him, because, although the statute expressly provided that &sect; 365.012 did not apply to the temporary storage for future disposal of litter or other solid waste and that the commission by rule should regulate temporary storage, no such rules had been promulgated. The court initially noted that defendant did not contend that his business of recycling wood and composition shingles into mulch and paving materials was constitutionally protected conduct. Thus, defendant had to show that &sect; 365.012(j) was unconstitutional as applied to his conduct. Because defendant declined to put on any evidence in support of his motion to quash, there was no evidence to support his claim on appeal that he was temporarily storing the wood and composition shingles for recycling purposes. The record also contained no evidence that defendant was confused about the meaning of the statute or was unable to comply with it. Defendant thus failed to show that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order quashing the indictments and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought a low-income housing exemption under Tex.

The court determined that the exemption applied only to housing projects constructed after December 31, 2001, as stated in &sect; 11.182(e). The court found no merit in the taxpayers' argument that the word &quot;includes&quot; in &sect; 11.182(e) allowed an exemption to be granted for a building constructed before the stated date. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 311.005 (1998) did not require such an expansive reading of the word &quot;includes,&quot; and such a construction would be contrary to the requirement of Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 311.011(a) (1998) that words be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage. The court also noted that, under Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teacher challenged the 280th District Court, Harris County, Texas' summary judgment ordering that she take nothing against appellee school district. In five issues, the teacher argued that the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine did not bar her causes of action because the 15-day deadline for filing a grievance violated the open courts, due process, and equal protection provisions of the Texas Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 7.057 did not eliminate the exhaustion requirement because the court interpreted the word &quot;may&quot; in Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 7.057(a) to mean that an aggrieved person may appeal, and if an appeal was taken, it had to be to the Commissioner of Education if the matter was one within the scope of the agency's review powers. Thus, the legislature did not intend to allow aggrieved parties to bypass an appeal to the Commissioner or to bypass available administrative remedies as a whole and to permit public school employees to seek immediate access to the courts. The 15-day deadline for filing a grievance did not violate the open courts, due process, and equal protection provisions of the Texas Constitution where there was no common law right to review of a grievance brought against a school district for misapplying the commissioner of education's directives. Therefore, the open courts and due process provisions of the Texas Constitution did not apply to the teacher's claims. Moreover, the 15-day deadline was rationally related to the goal of quickly resolving teacher complaints.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 337th District Court, Harris County (Texas), entered a final judgment of conviction after a jury found appellant guilty of the crime of bribery of a public servant. Appellant challenged that judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant worked for a law office doing legal support. He obtained information about recently-injured persons so the law firm could contact them. Through that work, appellant met a fire department data entry operator. Appellant paid her for information about accident victims who had been transported by the fire department's ambulances. Appellant and the data entry operator always met in public places. The data entry operator was always paid with a money order. Appellant was arrested for bribery of a public servant. The State indicted him under Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 36.02(a)(3) for his action in having the data entry operator violate her duty under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann.  &sect; 773.091(a) to not disclose confidential information. After he was convicted, the appellate court found appellant was given sufficient notice of the legal duty he had the data entry operator violate. Appellant showed some money he paid to her was for legitimate expenses and he offered legal defenses. Also, it found the evidence was legally sufficient and the trial court did not err in excluding materials appellant relied on to support his mistake of law defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Indictment was not defective as it put appellant on notice of legal duty he bribed fire department employee to violate, evidence was legally sufficient to support appellant's conviction, and trial court did not err by excluding various published laws and legal opinions appellant used to conclude his conduct was not criminal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney general challenged a judgment of the 192nd Judicial District Court, Dallas County, Texas, validating appellee city's proposal to pledge the various revenue sources to secure payment of municipal bonds that were to be issued to pay for the expansion of a convention center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by concluding that the state sales, use, and hotel occupancy taxes, and the city's portion of the mixed beverage taxes were not subject to biennial appropriation because Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 52-a applied and the city was not limited by Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 6 when it created an economic development program for qualified hotel projects and authorized the rebate of certain state taxes for 10 years, as the city's purpose was to encourage economic development. However, the trial court erred by concluding that the city was entitled to pledge the State's portion of the mixed beverage taxes to secure payment of the bonds because Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 2303.5055 could not be interpreted to permit one governmental body, such as the city, to make an agreement on behalf of another governmental body, such as the State. There was no evidence in the record that the State agreed to refund its portion of the mixed beverage taxes to the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the judgment validating the State's portion of the mixed beverage taxes as a valid revenue source which the city may pledge to secure payment of the bonds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that the statute was unconstitutionally vague on its face because it did not include as an element of the offense, or otherwise assure, that an individual had been given notice of his duty to report and register before he could be convicted of the offense.

The appellate court held that defendant could raise his specific vagueness claim only in the context of an &quot;as applied&quot; challenge, not a challenge of the basis that the statute was vague on its face.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the judgment of the County Court at Law No. 3 of Bexar County (Texas), reversing defendant's conviction of San Antonio, Tex., Code of Ordinances &sect; 22-140(b) (2002), and holding that &sect; 22-140(b) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with recklessly and unlawfully allowing patrons to queue on or wait for entrance into a cafe on the public right-of-way of the River Walk area, in violation of San Antonio, Tex., Code of Ordinances &sect; 22-140(b). Defendant argued that &sect; 22-140(b) failed to describe with reasonable certainty what actions constituted allowing patrons to queue on the public right-of-way, and that &quot;to allow&quot; was insufficient to establish intent for the purpose of charging a person with a penal offense. The appellate ruled that &sect; 22-140(b) was unconstitutionally vague because it criminalized a failure to act without informing those subject to prosecution that they must perform a duty to avoid punishment. San Antonio, Tex., Code of Ordinances &sect; 22-140(b), did not affirmatively impose on those subject to it the duty to adopt a particular system to prevent the queuing of patrons waiting for tables; indeed, it did not require those subject to the ordinance to adopt any system at all or otherwise inform them how they are to prevent queuing. Instead, &sect; 22-140(b) made an omission, the failure to prevent queuing, an offense merely by stating that the omission was an offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the father's death, conflicts arose between the mother and the paternal grandmother. The trial court rejected the mother's due process arguments and ordered grandparent visitation. The court held that &sect; 153.432 was unconstitutional as applied because there was no evidence that the mother was unfit, no evidence that the child's health or emotional well-being would suffer if the trial court deferred to her decisions, and no evidence that she intended to exclude the grandmother's access completely. The court stated that, so long as a parent adequately cared for his or her children, there normally would be no reason for the state to inject itself into the private realm of the family. Accordingly, the trial court's visitation order was a clear abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department removed the two minor children from the parents' care and custody. The trial court appointed separate counsel for the mother and the father and approved the family service plan proposed by the Department. The jury was instructed that it could terminate the mother's parental rights if they found that the mother engaged in at least one activity described in Tex. Fam. Code &sect; 161.001(1) (D), (E), (O), or (P) and that termination was in the best interests of the children. The court found that the jury could properly consider the mother's violation of the family service plan, as set forth in Tex. Fam. Code &sect; 161.001(1)(O). Section 161.001(1)(O) was facially valid because there was no set of circumstances could the section be valid. The court rejected the mother's assertion that the Department had been impermissibly granted legislative power. The mother had not demonstrated that there was fundamental error affecting her constitutional rights. Further, the mother did not have a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, because counsel's failure to preserve an objection challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 161.001(1)(O) did not amount to a deficient performance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was married to the grandparents' son, and two children were born during the marriage. The couple was divorced, and the father later died. The grandparents attempted to see their grandchildren on several occasions after the funeral, but were prevented from doing so. The mother argued that the grandparent access statute,&nbsp;Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 153.433 (2002), infringed on her fundamental constitutional rights, and the trial judge abused her discretion in granting access because the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support such a determination. The appellate court ruled that courts had previously held that the statute was not unconstitutional on its face, and since the mother failed to brief how the statute was unconstitutional as applied to her, she failed to preserve the issue for review. Also, in light of the mother's testimony that it was in the children's best interest to have a relationship with the grandparents, there was no abuse of discretion in finding that the grandparent's access was in the children's best interest, and the mother acted contrary to their best interest by refusing to allow the grandparents visitation.</SPAN></P>

The Texas Supreme Court affirmed in part, and reversed and remanded in part, holding that respondent need not prove petitioners' subjective knowledge, but that the election code's requirement the petitioners form a political committee and designate a treasurer before making expenditures &quot;in concert&quot; unconstitutionally burdens their associational rights, as husband and wife, under U.S. Const. amend. I. The Texas Supreme Court further held that other provisions under Tex. Elec.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with racing on a highway. He moved to set aside the information on the ground that both the information and the statute were unconstitutionally vague. The trial court denied the motion.

On appeal, the court found that defendant made no specific argument in his brief, or at oral argument, explaining how the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to his particular conduct. Given the absence of an &quot;as applied&quot; argument, the court concluded that defendant failed to show that the highway racing statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. As to defendant's claim that the information was inadequate for failing to adequately notify him of the particular conduct that gave rise to the criminal charges, the court found that he failed to explain how the alleged lack of notice prevented him from investigating the offense and preparing a defense, other than to state that the statute itself was too vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged a judgment of appellee Public Utility Commission (Texas) implementing the state's electric utilities deregulation laws governing who may purchase electricity for resale in 16 Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 25.111 (2001). Appellants complained appellee misinterpreted the statutes and as a result, unconstitutionally limited powers of home-rule municipalities by prohibiting them from purchasing electricity for resale to their citizens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1999, the Texas legislature deregulated the electric utility industry by enacting laws to allow competitive generation of power and retail sale of electricity. The legislature developed certain prerequisites for participating in deregulated retail sale of electricity. The statutory scheme distinguished retail electric providers from aggregators, those who joined electricity customers together to negotiate the purchase of electricity. Generally, aggregators could not purchase electricity for resale. Appellee Utility Commission adopted 16 Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 25.111 (2001), which imparted that municipalities could not purchase electricity for resale to their citizens. Appellant cities challenged this prohibition in court, but lost. Though appellants contended the deregulation statutes permitted home-rule municipalities to take title to electricity when acting as aggregators for their citizens, the court found that appellee Utility Commission's interpretation of the electricity deregulation statutes reflected in &sect; 25.111 was reasonable. The fact that municipalities could purchase electricity only for use in public facilities was a very narrow exception to the general rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of the state jail felony of possession of methamphetamine. The jury assessed his punishment at two years' confinement and a $ 2,500 fine and recommended that he be placed on community supervision. The 54th District Court McLennan County, Texas, suspended imposition of sentence and placed him on community supervision for five years. The trial court set bail for appeal at $ 10,000. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's conviction for felony possession of methamphetamine, the trial court set bail for appeal at $ 10,000. Defendant filed a motion to reduce the amount of bail to $ 500. He argued that the appeal bond statute violated the Equal Protection Clause in that it did not allow a personal bond on appeal even though Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.03 (2005) did for those awaiting trial. He stated that a distinction was made between those charged with a felony and those convicted of a felony, a distinction which had been held constitutional. The appellate court overruled defendant's complaint that the appeal bond statute was unconstitutional. Defendant concentrated on the fact that he had no means of making bail and never previously failed to appear in court. Ability to make bail was only one factor to be considered. Based on the evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting the amount of bail at $ 10,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth District of Texas held that obligor father had a vested right to rely on the time limitations in effect when his support obligation ended and that relator attorney general's administrative writ violated the constitutional ban on retroactive laws. The attorney general petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals concluded that the attorney general's administrative writ violated the Texas Constitution's ban on retroactive laws by characterizing the former four-year limit on wage-withholding as a statute of limitations, rather than a jurisdictional or remedial provision. The appellate court found, however, that the former four-year limitation in Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 14.43 (repealed 1995) was on the court's jurisdiction to order withholding of child-support arrearages, not on the obligation itself. The administrative writ was a remedy for the father's repeated and continuing violation of the divorce decree that ordered him to pay specific amounts for his children's support. An administrative writ of withholding for delinquent child support did not seek to impose a legal liability on the father to support his children. Statutes providing time limits within which enforcement of an existing support liability could be effected concerned the court's continuing jurisdiction and did not affect substantive rights. The administrative withholding statute, being remedial in nature, did not violate the Texas Constitution's ban on retroactive laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the County Criminal Court at Law No. 14, Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of misdemeanor marijuana possession in violation of Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.121(a) (2003). On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the marijuana possession statute on the ground that it interfered with the free exercise of his religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the marijuana possession statute violated the First Amendment by interfering with the free exercise of his religious beliefs. He attacked the statute's constitutionality as applied to him and did not attack the statute's facial constitutionality. Although defendant urged the jury to consider his religious beliefs in determining his guilt, he never argued to the trial court or requested a ruling that the statute was unconstitutional. The court concluded that defendant thereby waived that argument on appeal pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). The court noted that even if defendant had preserved his argument, the court rejected it. The court stated that it presumed that a statute was constitutional, and it was defendant's burden to prove it unconstitutional as applied to his specific conduct. The court determined that an individual's religious beliefs did not excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State was free to regulate. The court concluded that the marijuana possession statute was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant on the basis that it interfered with his free exercise of religion.</SPAN></P>

The State argued that defendant failed to preserve his contention that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. The appellate court ruled that defendant waived the issue on appeal because defendant did not raise the issue in the court below.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, taxpayer groups one and two, sought a judgment that appellee appraisal district court not assess property taxes against the groups' recreational vehicles (&quot;RVs&quot;). The 357th District Court of Cameron County (Texas) found that the RVs were improvements to realty under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 1.04(3), the RVs were not exempt as personal property under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 11.14, and they were subject to taxation. The groups appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The groups claimed the RVs were tangible personal property and exempt from taxation. The trial court ruled that they were subject to taxation. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The RVs were transportable structures. Under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 1.04(3), the RVs could not be improvements and the trial court erred in so deciding. Undisputed evidence showed that groups only used their RVs temporarily and seasonally. By failing to present evidence that their RVs were not constructed before June 15, 1976, group one failed to prove that their RVs were not mobile homes that were included in the definition of manufactured home used by reference in Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 11.14(b). The trial court did not err in failing to exempt from taxation the RVs belonging to this group, for purposes of Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(b). Group two satisfied the burden of proving that their RVs were such as defined by the law and were not manufactured homes. The RVs belonging to this group were tangible personal property and not manufactured homes and the trial court erred in finding that these RVs were not exempt personal property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment as to group one, but the court reversed the judgment as to group two and remanded for a determination of attorney fees related to group two's claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to tampering with a government record by offering to sell a standard proof of liability motor vehicle insurance form with intent to defraud. The trial court placed her on probation and, subsequently, the State sought to proceed with adjudication. She pled true and the trial court revoked her probation. She appealed, arguing the order revoking her probation was void because her underlying conviction was based on an unconstitutionally vague statute. The court initially noted there was a distinction between facial and as-applied constitutional challenges because only facial challenges affected the jurisdiction of a court to render a judgment against a defendant. The court held defendant's argument that Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 37.10(a) was unconstitutionally vague, but only as applied to proof of liability forms and similar documents that were used by the government for information, was an as-applied challenge. The court affirmed, holding even if defendant's argument were sustained as an as-applied challenge, it would not have rendered underlying conviction void, thus her appeal was unpreserved as it was not raised in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). The indictment alleged defendant was convicted of DWI on four previous occasions. Defendant filed a pretrial petition for writ of habeas corpus, asserting that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 49.09(e) (2003) was unconstitutional and an illegal restraint on his liberty. The 399th Judicial District Court, Bexar County (Texas), denied the petition, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not assert that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 49.09(e) was unconstitutional on its face. Instead, defendant argued that the State was improperly attempting to use a prior conviction to elevate the primary offense to a third degree felony. Defendant's assertion amounted to an attack on the charging instrument and an argument that the State would be unable to satisfy its burden of proof at trial, which the appellate court ruled were not proper grounds for habeas corpus relief. With respect to defendant's argument that the indictment failed to provide notice of whether the State must comply with &sect; 49.09, which in turn, deprived him of the ability to decide whether he should stipulate to two of the prior convictions, was not preserved for review, Tex. R. App. P. 33.1. Also, having determined that any complaint related to lack of notice had been waived, defendant's argument that &sect; 49.09 violated the Double Jeopardy Clause was waived, as it was inadequately briefed, Tex. R. App. P. 38.1. It was unclear from defendant's argument on appeal how the Double Jeopardy Clause was violated, although he again raised the issue of lack of notice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant convicted felon filed a petition for the expunction of arrest records in the 333rd District Court, Harris County (Texas). The trial court expunged the felon's 1972 felony arrest records pursuant to the agreement of the parties, but refused to expunge his 1971 marihuana possession arrest records.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The felon argued that the expunction statute,&nbsp;Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 55.01, was unconstitutional under both the United States Constitution and the Texas Constitution when applied to his marihuana possession arrest and petition for expunction. The felon argued in his reply brief that he could properly raise a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the statute for the first time on appeal. The appellate court concluded that the felon made an &quot;as applied&quot; constitutional challenge rather than a facial challenge. The felon did not contend that the statute always operated unconstitutionally. Rather, he stated that the statute was unconstitutional where applied to his 1971 marihuana possession arrest. The appellate court noted that the felon successfully used the same statute to obtain expunction of his 1972 arrest. Thus, the facts of the case demonstrated that a facial challenge was inappropriate. The felon did not raise his constitutional claims at the trial court level in his petition or at the expunction hearing. Accordingly, no error was preserved for review, and the appellate court could not reach the merits of the claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in two separate cases of harassment, a Class B misdemeanor, under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07(a)(7), (c) (2011). In the first case, he was placed on community supervision. In the second case, he was sentenced to 60 days in jail, and the County Court at Law No. 3 of Jefferson County, Texas, revoked his community supervision in the first case and sentenced him to 60 days in jail for that offense. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with harassment based on an allegation that he repeatedly sent text messages to another person. The court held that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07(a)(7) did not implicate the free-speech guarantee of the First Amendment because the conduct to which it was susceptible of application would be, in the usual case, noncommunicative. Moreover, &sect; 42.07(a)(7) gave a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know the prohibited conduct and established definite guidelines for law enforcement to follow when determining whether a person had violated the statute. Accordingly, defendant had not shown that &sect; 42.07(a)(7) was unduly vague as applied to his conduct. Defendant also failed to show that &sect; 42.07(a)(7) was unconstitutional on its face. The statute was not vague or overbroad. The court concluded that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to quash the information because the information tracked the language of &sect; 42.07(a)(7) and, thus, possessed sufficient specificity to provide defendant with notice of the charged offense. The language pertaining to defendant's conduct was not vague or indefinite.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a corporation, was transporting chicken waste when some spilled. Defendant's employees washed the waste into a storm drain. After defendant was convicted of unauthorized discharge under Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect; 7.147 (2000), it sought review. In affirming, the court determined that &sect; 7.147 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied. The definition of &quot;to discharge&quot; in Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect; 26.001 was sufficient to apprise a person of reasonable intelligence of fair notice of what was prohibited. The term &quot;to discharge&quot; adequately conveyed that the legislature intended to criminalize the release of water or pollutants into or near water in Texas. Moreover, the court did not consider a vagueness challenge based on the discretion given to law enforcement because that was merely a hypothetical situation. Next, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction based on the acts of the employees and the evidence that the water was contaminated with the waste. Finally, the trial court did not err by refusing to instruct the jury on causation under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 6.04 since the employees were involved in washing the waste into the drain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Criminal District Court No. 2. Dallas County (Texas), which convicted him of retaliation, a violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 36.06(a) (2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court denied his motion to quash the indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to retaliation. He contended on appeal that the trial court erred by denying his motion to quash because the indictment failed to allege an offense and the retaliation statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. The court held that defendant's arguments were without merit. Because the indictment in defendant's case tracked the retaliation statute, it was not fundamentally defective for failing to state an offense. Moreover, the indictment also alleged the manner and means by which defendant was alleged to have threatened the complainant; it specified that defendant made the threat face to face and in person. Defendant thus received sufficient notice to allow him to prepare a defense. Because the record did not reveal what words defendant allegedly uttered or under what circumstances he allegedly uttered them, the court could not address his claim that the retaliation statute was unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant complained the cause should have been dismissed because of prosecutorial vindictiveness. The appellate court found that it appeared chronologically unlikely that the stalking charge was the product of defendant's refusal to plead guilty to the telephone harassment charge. Defendant waived consideration of her contention that the charging instrument provided insufficient notice of the conduct that allegedly placed the victim in fear of injury or death. Defendant failed to specifically identify any alleged deficiencies in the information, and failed to object to the alleged defect prior to trial. A defect of form or substance in an information was waived if no objection was made before the date trial commenced.  Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 47.072 (Vernon Supp. 1999) specifically prohibited conduct that caused another person to be placed in fear of bodily injury or death. Defendant was not engaged in constitutionally protected conduct because her conduct placed her victim in fear of bodily injury or death on more than one occasion. Pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 27.10 (Vernon Supp. 2001), all motions to set aside an information had to be in writing.</SPAN></P>

The terms &quot;excessive&quot; and &quot;unusual,&quot; although not explicitly based on a reasonable person objective standard, were terms that implied that muffler noise had to be outside normal standards for motor vehicles, which ordinary persons could objectively determine. Section 547.604(a) did not present a standard that depended solely on what an enforcement officer found annoying, irritating, or unsatisfactory. The court also found that the evidence was sufficient to show that there was reasonable suspicion that defendant violated &sect; 547.604(a) and therefore that a stop was justified and suppression of evidence not required under the Fourth Amendment, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, or Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.23.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the County Criminal Court at Law No. 2, Harris County (Texas), which, after denying defendant's motion to quash the information, accepted defendant's nolo contendre plea to allowing the discharge of wastes and pollutants in violation of Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect; 7.147(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The information tracked the language of &sect; 7.147(a) by alleging that defendant, a corporation, allowed the discharge of pollutants. Defendant argued that the information failed to allege a statutory duty to act and that &sect; 7.147 was unconstitutionally vague as applied because it did not define the class of persons who might have such a duty. The court held that the use of the word &quot;allow&quot; created a positive duty as to persons standing in a responsible relation to the prohibited act of unauthorized discharge to act to prevent a violation of &sect; 7.147. Therefore, the State sufficiently alleged a statutory duty to act by tracking the language of &sect; 7.147(a). It was not necessary to allege the means by which the discharge occurred. Because the word &quot;allow&quot; necessarily implied control over the allowed activity, &sect; 7.147 imposed a duty only on those who had a responsible relationship to, or a responsible share in, the prohibited act. There was no indication in the record that defendant was not within the class of persons who stood in a responsible relation to the unlawful discharge. Consequently, defendant's claim of vagueness lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

She argued that she did not need a permit because she was welding within a fenced parking lot area, which was a confined space. The court held that the ordinances were clear and that &quot;confined spaces&quot; had to refer to areas that were not open to flammable materials, subject to air currents, or likely to expose citizens to danger. A parking lot, even a fenced one, did not fit this description. A person of ordinary intelligence would understand that welding in a large outdoor area posed a fire hazard and would have fair notice that it was not a &quot;confined space.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction of possession of a firearm by a felon in the 23rd District Court of Wharton County (Texas), claiming Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 46.04 (1994) was unconstitutionally vague and violated ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In March 1994, appellant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance. In 1996, appellant was found in possession of a firearm, charged, and convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon. The court affirmed the conviction, finding Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 46.04 (1994) constitutional and not a ex post facto violation as applied to appellant. The words &quot;who was convicted of a felony&quot; had a meaning which could have been understood by a person of ordinary intelligence and gave fair notice that any felony offense might have subjected a felon to prosecution under the statute. Appellant's behavior was a criminal offense when it occurred, pursuant to the old form of the statute. Appellant was not deprived of fair warning of what conduct would have given rise to criminal penalties under the statute. Before appellant was charged with possession of a firearm, a court opinion emphasized the statute's central purpose of keeping felons from going about with firearms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction affirmed because statute was not unconstitutionally vague where the words &quot;who was convicted of a felony&quot; had a meaning readily understood by an ordinary person, gave fair notice to a felon such as appellant, and did not violate ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to the charge and received deferred adjudication pursuant to a plea agreement. Defendant admitted the allegations of the State's motion to revoke and was sentenced in accordance with a second plea agreement. Defendant argued on appeal that the original proceeding was void because Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.15 (Vernon Supp. 2002) was facially unconstitutional under both the state and federal constitutions because it deprived defendant of the right to compulsory process. The appellate court dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction. Defendant had not appealed the original order granting deferred adjudication and was, therefore, precluded from appealing unless the judgment in the original proceeding was itself void. As defendant was not challenging the statute under which he was convicted as void, only a procedural statute governing the acceptance of the plea, the void-judgment exception to the rule precluding appeal did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling a Batson challenge. The court was to decide whether the court of appeals erred in holding that race could be a factor co-existing with a non-racial reason as long as race was not the only reason for the strike. The State argued that the fact that a prospective juror was born in Liberia was a race-neutral reason for its use of a peremptory strike and therefore, the court of appeals properly held that there was no evidence in the record that race was the reason for the State's strike. Only if the court held the country of one's birth was not a race-neutral reason for exercising a peremptory strike, would it reach the question of whether its combination with two race-neutral reasons violated Batson. Discrimination based on the country where one was born was not race discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The trial court awarded attorney fees to the widow for the trial and for the fee hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent, who had been taking immunosuppressant drugs following a kidney transplant, injured his knee while at work and developed an infection in his leg. The infection failed to heal, and the decedent's chronic liver disease worsened until he eventually died. Relying on a differential diagnosis, a treating physician opined that the knee injury and resulting infection worsened the liver disease and caused the death. The insurer's expert testified to the contrary. The jury determined that the knee injury was a producing cause of the death. The court held that the differential diagnosis provided a reliable foundation for the treating physician's expert opinion. The evidence was therefore sufficient. The trial court's definition of &quot;producing cause&quot; accurately stated the law and was proper under Tex. R. Civ. P. 277. Neither Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 nor Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 10 guaranteed a jury trial on a request for attorney fees under Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 408.221 (2006), and the fee claim was properly submitted to the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the evidence established that there was group health insurance available to the employer which could be provided by an insurer and that the insurer provided health insurance programs. The evidence was legally insufficient to support the legal significance attributed to the trial court's findings 1, 2, 4, and 5. Under the agreement, the employer recognized that it wanted to keep its employees for more than just a minimum term of employment and as an incentive to keep its employees beyond that minimum term, promised employees who had 15 or more continuous service, the benefit of continued participation, past the employee's retirement, in current or future group health insurance programs. The retirees each continued their employment beyond the minimum number of years required and met the other conditions of the resolution. The retirees accepted the employer's promise by performance. The trial court erred in concluding that requiring the employer to participate in the insurance program so that the retirees could continue would create a debt under Tex. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7. The agreement did not bargain away the employer's ability to appraise property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his first issue, the individual argued that the SVP statute, Tex.

The appellate court had repeatedly held the SVP statute was not punitive, and the Texas Supreme Court had not written on the issue.  Issue one was overruled. The individual's second issue contended that the SVP statute and the concomitant &quot;final judgment and order of commitment&quot; were unconstitutionally vague. The individual's complaints regarding the order of commitment were based upon its conformance with the statute. The appellate court had held the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, and the Texas Supreme Court had not written on the issue. Accordingly, the appellate court declined to find the statute and the attendant judgment were unconstitutionally vague. Issue two was also overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, set fire to a couch at a school with items brought from his home. The fire caused over $100,000 in damages. At a delinquency proceeding, the parents were ordered to pay $25,000 in restitution. They sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that allowing courts to impose restitution on the parents of delinquent children and placing the burden on them to prove good faith efforts to prevent such behavior as a defense to liability did not violate due process. Moreover, because no common law cause of action was being abridged, Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 54.048, 54.041(b) (2002 &amp; Supp. 2005) did not violate Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. There was sufficient evidence to support the award because the parents did not prove that they made reasonable good faith efforts under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;54.041(b); the fire was set from items brought from home, and the evidence showed that defendant had been setting fires there for years. Finally, although Tex. Crim. Code Ann. art. 42.037(c) (Supp. 2005) allowed the trial court to consider other factors, it was not required to consider how the school's actions contributed to the delinquent conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Travis County, Texas, granted in part and denied in part a plea to the jurisdiction filed by defendants, the Texas Youth Commission (TYC) and its executive director, in an action by plaintiffs, current and former employees, for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief that alleged that Tex. Hum. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 61.035(b)&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived them of property rights in their TYC employment. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the district court erred in failing to dismiss two of the former employees' wrongful-termination/due-process claims to the extent that they sought equitable relief from TYC itself, because a suit for equitable relief to restrain official conduct that was ultra vires of an agency's statutory or constitutional powers had to be asserted against a state official, in his official capacity, and sovereign immunity barred such a claim if asserted against the agency itself. The live pleadings fell far short of alleging the facts required to assert a viable due-process claim based on stigmatization. The district court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs' takings claims because the jurisdictional defects were incurable. As to a third former employee who was formally terminated after &sect; 61.035(b) took effect, the district court erred in dismissing his wrongful-termination/due-process claim because he should have been permitted to replead the claim to seek equitable relief against a proper state official. However, the district court properly dismissed his claim to the extent he sought monetary relief or sought any relief from TYC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order to the extent it failed to dismiss the wrongful-termination/due-process claims of two of the former employees against TYC and rendered judgment dismissing those claims. The court also reversed the dismissal of the third former employee's wrongful-termination/due-process claim to the extent it would seek equitable relief against an appropriate state official. The court affirmed the remainder of the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted, the State moved to have his sentences cumulated and served consecutively. The trial court granted the motion, setting the sentence at a total of 24 years. On appeal, defendant argued his 24-year sentence violated his right to fair trial and due process under Apprendi because it was in excess of the statutory maximum sentence allowed by each respective count. The appellate court initially noted the trial court's ruling did not cause any individual sentence to exceed the applicable maximum on any particular count, as each individual sentence was within the statutory limit for the crime charged; therefore, it could not be said, as to any individual count, that the trial court's findings resulted in the imposition of a greater punishment than was authorized by the jury's verdict. The appellate court held there was no constitutionally cognizable right to concurrent rather than consecutive sentences; therefore, defendant failed to establish the unconstitutionality of the sentencing statutes challenged.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been a passenger in the vehicle involved in the DUI, and defendant refused to comply with the officer's instructions and became belligerent.

The officers testified that they told defendant numerous times to wait behind the vehicle and by the patrol car and that defendant kept moving and would not do as the officers asked. Defendant admitted disregarding the officers' repeated orders to stand back and described two occasions when he approached the officers and was told to go back.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his first issue, the individual argued that the SVP statute, Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. tit. 11, ch. 841, was unconstitutional because it was punitive in nature. The appellate court had repeatedly held that the SVP statute was not punitive, and the Texas Supreme Court had not written on this issue; therefore, the individual's first issue was overruled. The individual's second issue contended that the SVP statute and the concomitant &quot;final judgment and order of commitment&quot; were unconstitutionally vague. The individual's complaints regarding the order of commitment were based upon its conformance with the statute. The appellate court had held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, and the Texas Supreme Court had not written on the issue. Accordingly, the appellate court declined to find the statute and the attendant judgment were unconstitutionally vague. Issue two was also overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a workers' compensation case, the trial court did not err by transferring venue from Maverick County to Travis County, Texas. Appellant was a citizen of Mexico and did not contend that he lived in Maverick County at the time of his injury; there was no provision in Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 410.252(c) (Supp. 2012) for venue in the Texas county nearest a non-resident's place of residence. Because Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 410.252(c) did not apply, the general venue statute applied instead. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 15.002(a)(3) provided that venue was proper in the county of a corporate defendant's principal place of business, which was Travis County. The resulting transfer of venue did not violate the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the 208th District Court, Harris County (Texas) of murder. On remand, a jury assessed a life sentence and a $ 10,000 fine. Defendant appealed, challenging his punishment and the constitutionality of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.29(b) (Supp. 2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murdering his seven-month pregnant girlfriend. On remand, he was given a life sentence and a fine. The court affirmed. Presuming defendant did not waive the issue, the trial court did not violate defendant's constitutional right to a jury trial by applying Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.29(b) (Supp. 2007) and instructing the jury to decide punishment only. A sister court had rejected the same challenge to the statute, holding that a defendant held no constitutional right to have the same jury decide guilt and punishment. The court declined to acknowledge constitutional rights that sister courts and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had refused to recognize. Article 44.29(b) was not facially unconstitutional. With respect to testimony regarding the weight and condition of the fetus, defendant failed to preserve error under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Even if defendant had timely objected, any error in admitting the testimony was harmless because the gender of the fetus was shown on the autopsy report, which had been admitted without objection, and testimony was admitted without objection that the victim was pregnant with a boy at the time of her death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the State's evidence was sufficient to allow a rational jury to find defendant participated in a race, i.e., was using his car to outgain or outdistance another car. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for directed verdict. Because defendant did not offer any evidence to raise an inference that his conduct was immediately necessary to avoid any imminent harm, the trial court did not err in refusing to submit his request for an instruction on the statutory defense of necessity. The trial court also did not err in admitting photographs that showed images of high performance additions to defendant's car, including the type of engine and several after-market additions. The arresting officer testified the additions were commonly added to high-performance vehicles owned by racers to enhance a vehicle's overall performance. Based on the officer's testimony, the photographs were relevant under Tex. R. Evid. 401 to the alleged racing charge because the photographs had a tendency to make the determination that defendant was racing more or less probable by showing his car had high performance additions commonly used by racing vehicles.</SPAN></P>

Water Code Ann. &sect; 49.066, as originally enacted in 1995 or as amended in 1999, did not waive the water district's immunity from suit, (4) the water district's general pleadings for judgment and costs and its requests for relief did not waive its immunity, and (5) equitable estoppel did not prevent the water district from asserting its immunity since it acted within its discretion to protect the perceived interests of the public by rejecting the contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Parties filed cross-appeals from an order of the 224th Judicial District Court, Bexar County (Texas) which declared that the San Antonio River was navigable under Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann.  &sect; 21.001 (1978), granted summary judgment in favor of city but denied the city's request for attorney's fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company notified defendant city (City) that it intended offering passenger barge service on the San Antonio River (River). Undaunted by City's refusal to allow such service, plaintiff began operations. Soon after the City impounded plaintiff's barge, plaintiff sought declaratory relief and damages. City counterclaimed. On cross-motions, plaintiff was granted partial summary judgment, but denied all other relief requested. The trial court granted City's motion for summary judgment. The appellate court affirmed, holding that Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann.  &sect; 21.001(3) (1978) rendered the River navigable, although not actually navigable. However, the City was entitled to regulate navigation pursuant to its police power granted to home rule cities under Tex. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5. and the City's charter. The appellate court further held that the City was engaged in a governmental function when it impounded plaintiff's barge, making the City immune from tort liability under the Texas Tort Claims Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment declaring river &quot;navigable&quot; was affirmed because statute so declared, but notwithstanding such declaration, City could regulate navigation pursuant to its police power as home rule city. Furthermore, City was immune from tort liability because it was engaged in statutorily defined governmental functions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Criminal District Court No. 3 of Tarrant County (Texas), which revoked defendant's community supervision and adjudicated defendant guilty of robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the revocation hearing, defendant pled true to several instances of testing positive for illegal drug use. He also testified that he had used cocaine during his deferred adjudication community supervision. On appeal, defendant contended that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b) (Supp. 2006) was unconstitutional because it allowed the trial court unlimited discretion regardless of the evidence to support revocation. The court stated that, to the extent that defendant was complaining that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him, he failed to preserve his complaint under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a) by making an objection or getting a ruling. To the extent that defendant raised a facial challenge, it lacked merit because defendant did not show that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b) (Supp. 2006) was unconstitutionally applied to him. Because defendant pled true to the drug use allegation and testified regarding his use of cocaine, the evidence was sufficient to support the revocation.  Defendant therefore failed to show that the trial court's decision to proceed to adjudication was based on whim rather than sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner utility appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First District of Texas reversing a summary judgment and holding that respondent Harris County was immune from suit on the utility's claim for reimbursement, under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 251.102, and that the utility had no vested property interest to assert a claim for inverse condemnation, under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 17, 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility provided telephone service and maintained underground telecommunications facilities in the public right-of-way along the tollway, pursuant to Tex. Util. Code Ann. &sect; 181.082. When the County began construction on the tollway, the utility was required to relocate its facilities in the right-of-way. Despite a long-standing common law principle that utilities relocated at its own expense, the utility contended that it was entitled to compensation for its relocation expenses under the takings clause, under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, because Tex. Util. Code Ann. &sect; 181.082 granted it a property interest. The court held that the traditional common law rule was unaltered by Tex. Util. Code Ann. &sect; 181.082. The utility was not eligible for relocation costs, under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 251.102. Moreover, the utility's statutory reimbursement claim was barred by governmental immunity, which was not clearly waived by Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 251.102 or by the County. The court held that the legislature did not intend for counties to pay all utility relocation costs for all acquisition projects. The court would not construe the statute beyond its plain meaning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the 385th District Court, Midland County (Texas), which convicted him of burglary of a habitation, a second degree felony in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.02 (2003). Defendant argued that &sect; 30.02 was unconstitutional as applied to him because the punishment provided for in that statute was &quot;wholly disproportionate to the crime&quot; and constituted cruel and unusual punishment in his case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of breaking into the complainant's home at night while it was occupied by the complainant and defendant's former girlfriend, assaulting his former girlfriend by hitting her in the head and back, and then wrestling with the complainant until he threw defendant out of the house. The trial court assessed punishment at confinement for 10 years but suspended the imposition of the sentence and placed defendant on community supervision for eight years. Defendant argued that his conviction for a second degree felony under &sect; 30.02 was unconstitutional because the offense could be broken down into two misdemeanors--criminal trespass and simple assault--whose punishment range combined would not exceed the minimum punishment for a second degree felony. The court held that the trial court did not err in upholding the constitutionality of &sect; 30.02 as applied to defendant. The offense that defendant committed fell directly within the provisions of &sect; 30.02. Defendant did not commit a simple trespass or assault. Defendant's punishment did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment or any other state or federal constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held a pretrial hearing on appellant's writ of habeas corpus, at which appellant presented no evidence other than copies of his indictments and his bail bonds. The court heard arguments of counsel and denied relief. Having only been charged under the statute, appellant had failed to show how the possession with intent to deliver statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. Until a jury actually convicted him based on evidence that falls short of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, his complaint was premature; the court could not address the merits of appellant's complaint because it was premature.</SPAN></P>

The owners also contended that the trial court erred in failing to submit certain issues to the jury regarding their takings claim. Because the relative had a common law right of ingress and egress to reach the cemetery, no taking occurred, and Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 711.041 was constitutional as applied to the facts presented in the instant case. Because the pleadings requested relief on behalf of &quot;any other individual related to the decedents,&quot; Tex. R. Civ. P. 306 did not provide authority for overturning the trial court's judgment in favor of other relatives of the decedents. The trial court's judgment was simply a declaration of the extent of the common law right of ingress and egress created by the dedication of a portion of the land as a private burial ground.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 1st District Court, Jasper County, Texas, granted two temporary injunctions enjoining the appellant law enforcement officials from prosecuting the appellee business owners or initiating forfeiture proceedings against any of their property used legally or operated legally in conformance with Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 47.01(4)(B) (Vernon Supp. 2002). The law enforcement officials appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court first considered whether there was evidence to support the trial court's implied finding that the law enforcement officials had unconstitutionally applied this statute. Evidence showed that previously the law enforcement officials had written a letter to all merchants who had certain machines in their establishments, informing them that the machines were illegal gambling devices. The letter threatened prosecution and seizure of the machines. At the time of the hearing, however, the law enforcement officials indicated they recognized the statutory exclusion and would apply it to machines that operated within the exclusion. Thus, at the time of the hearing, there was no unconstitutional application of the statute. Therefore, there was no justiciable controversy was raised, and the trial court had no civil jurisdiction over the matters alleged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged a decision of the trial court, which, on a petition filed by appellee Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services, terminated the father's parental rights and found that his appeal was frivolous under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.405. The court had reversed and ordered the parties to brief the merits. The issues, having been fully briefed, were now ripe for consideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's rights were terminated to his three children. The court affirmed on appeal. A witness, who was a chief medical examiner for a county and a licensed medical doctor who was board certified in forensic pathology, testified that he found the cause of death of one of the father's children, for which the father was charged with capital murder, was cranial cerebral trauma. The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's finding that the witness was qualified to testify as an expert under Tex. R. Evid. 702. Because the father had not alleged there were other complaints he would have raised but for the restrictions of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.405(b), (i), he had not shown that the statute deprived him of his rights to due process and he failed to demonstrate that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. The court did not need to reach the constitutionality of &sect; 263.405 under the separation-of-powers clause as a father wholly failed to show how he was harmed by its application to his case. Any decision in this regard would have been advisory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the father's death, the grandparents sought a temporary order for visitation pursuant to the Texas Grandparent Access Statute,&nbsp;Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 153.433 (2002). The grandparents did not contend that the mother was not a fit parent. The mother testified that she did not believe it was in the child's best interest to have contact with the grandparents. The mother challenged the constitutionality of the statute under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that the statute was not facially unconstitutional when construed to require a trial court to presume that a fit parent acted in the best interest of his or her child. Thus, a constitutional application of the Texas Grandparent Access Statute required a finding either that the mother was unfit or that the denial of grandparent access would significantly impair the child's physical health or emotional well-being. The trial court could not reasonably have made such findings because there was no evidence to overcome the presumption that the mother's decision was in the child's best interest. The grandparents did not show that they had a bond or relationship with the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court conditionally granted the mother's petition for a writ of mandamus and directed the trial court to vacate the temporary order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to find that he had the intent to arouse or gratify sexual desire. The court disagreed. The evidence was sufficient as to intent to arouse or gratify sexual desire, even though the touching at issue was through clothing, the touching occurred before a statutory amendment defining &quot;sexual contact&quot; to include touching through clothing, and there was no evidence of nakedness, erection, facial gestures, verbalization, or ejaculation. The court also held that: (1) an issue concerning jury charge error was inadequately briefed under Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(g), (h) because the actual argument section of defendant's brief did not address the issue, although the summary did; (2) defendant's motion to be released on bond during the pendency of the appeal was properly denied because Tex.

Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 3g; and (3) the court could not say that it was harmful error to admit videotapes of the complainant's out-of-court statements because defendant did not request that the tapes be included in the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a petition for discretionary review of a decision of the Third Court of Appeals, Williamson County (Texas), which held that it &quot;need not consider&quot; whether the telephone harassment statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07(a)(4), had been unconstitutionally applied to appellant because he had failed to preserve that objection for appellate consideration by raising the issue at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with violation of &sect; 42.07(a)(4). Appellant filed a motion to quash. He argued that &quot;the vagueness&quot; of &sect; 42.07(a)(4) was readily apparent. The trial court denied appellant's motion, and he continued to object at various times. The jury subsequently found appellant guilty. Appellant filed a motion for new trial, in which he argued that &sect; 42.07(a)(4) was unconstitutional as applied to him in his case. The motion for new trial was overruled. In his petition for review, appellant argues that his &quot;as applied&quot; challenges to &sect; 42.07(a)(4) were preserved for appellate review because he filed and obtained a ruling on his motion for new trial, which specified that he was complaining about the application of the statute under which he had been convicted. The court concluded that appellant's motion for new trial was specific enough to put the trial court on notice of his &quot;unconstitutionally vague as applied&quot; challenge, but that it was not specific enough to put the trial court on notice of his &quot;unconstitutionally overbroad as applied&quot; challenge. Finally, the court held that appellant's motion for new trial was timely within the meaning of Tex. R. App. P. 33.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded the case to that court so that it could reconsider appellant's point of error regarding his &quot;vague as applied&quot; challenges to the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, patient's estate and sole wrongful death beneficiary, challenged the judgment of the 350th District Court of Taylor County, Texas, granting summary judgment in favor of appellees, doctor and hospital, on the basis that the wrongful death and survival action was barred by the two-year statute of limitations set forth in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (Vernon Supp. 2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' suit was filed on July 24, 2001, and was based on the mis-diagnosis of the patient's cancer. The patient was first diagnosed with a benign gastric ulcer, and later diagnosed with bone cancer that originated in her stomach. Appellants asserted that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment since the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 prevented the application of the limitations provision of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01, and that the limitations provision was unconstitutional. The appellate court ruled that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01, was not unconstitutional in the instant case because the cause of action was not based in the common law. The summary judgment evidence established that the alleged negligence occurred on April 6, 1998, the date when appellants alleged that the patient was first mis-diagnosed. Under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01, the statute of limitations period expired on April 6, 2000. Appellants had no common-law right to bring an action against appellees, as the sole claim against appellees was based on the wrongful death and survival statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant private adoption agency challenged a decision from the 328th District Court, Fort Bend County, Texas, which made a sua sponte determination that Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mother decided to put a child up for adoption. The agency requested a termination of the father's rights under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 161.002(b) (Supp. 2008). The trial court made a sua sponte determination that the statute was unconstitutional under the federal and state constitutions based on due process and equal protection. This appeal followed. In reversing, the appellate court determined that the evidence established that any notice required by Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 37.006(b) (2008) was given. The trial court had the authority in this case to consider the issue of constitutionality of &sect; 161.002(b) sua sponte. Courts were required to presume the constitutionality of a statute; moreover, a constitutional issue should not have been reached unless it was absolutely required. Here, the father did not automatically have full constitutional parental rights by virtue of his mere biological relationship. He had to take some action to assert those rights early in the child's life. Without evidence of an actual injury before it, the trial court erred in finding &sect; 161.002(b)&nbsp;unconstitutional either as applied or on its face.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another man followed an undercover park ranger to a secluded location, and defendant unbuckled his pants and began massaging himself. The ranger arrested both men for indecent exposure. At trial, the State admitted evidence of defendant's prior conviction for the same crime. The appellate court held that the indecent exposure statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect;21.08 (Vernon 1994), was constitutional. It was not void for vagueness, as it gave individuals of ordinary intelligence fair notice of the forbidden conduct. It did not violate equal protection guarantees, as no suspect class was involved (sexual orientation not being recognized as a suspect classification), and the statute was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. However, the trial court erred in admitting evidence of defendant's prior conviction. This evidence was not necessary or relevant to prove defendant's intent, which could have been inferred from his statements and conduct. The error was not harmless, as the prior offense tended to show that defendant had a propensity to expose himself in public places, and the prosecutor emphasized this evidence in his closing argument.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.12 (Supp. 2006). The individual sought habeas corpus relief. The trial court denied the individual relief and the court affirmed on appeal, finding that the statute was not unconstitutional as claimed. The individual presented no evidence to show that the statute reached a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, nor did he show that there was a realistic danger that the statute itself compromised recognized protections under the First Amendment of parties not before the court. Moreover, the State had a legitimate and compelling interest in protecting students. Thus, the individual's overbreadth challenge failed. Due process claims were generally not recognizable by pretrial habeas corpus, and furthermore, the void for vagueness complaint failed on the merits because the statute was not vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 213th District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, adjudicated defendant's guilt for possession of child pornography, revoked his community supervision, and sentenced him to eight years' confinement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to possession of child pornography. The trial court placed him on deferred adjudication community supervision for ten years. The State later filed a petition to proceed to adjudication, alleging that he violated the terms of his community supervision. Defendant testified at the hearing, and entered a plea of true to the State's allegations. Defendant claimed that his due process rights under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 19, 29 were violated when his probation was revoked under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b). To the extent defendant was complaining that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him, he failed to preserve his complaint in the trial court by making an objection. Defendant also failed to show that the trial court's decision to proceed to adjudication was based on anything other than sufficient evidence. By failing to show that the statute was unconstitutionally applied to him, he failed to establish standing to raise a facial challenge to the statute.</SPAN></P>

The officers gave the individual money, who handed the money over to the bartender. The individual took the officers outside of the bar and handed them the cocaine. A search of defendant's truck ensued, and more cocaine was discovered. The trial court determined that the search was a valid warrantless search authorized by Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 101.04 and 101.71. The appellate court noted that there was some evidence that defendant did not consent to the search. The appellate court did conclude, however, that the time, place, and scope of the search were limited. Therefore, &sect;&sect; 101.04 and 101.71 were not unconstitutional as applied to defendant. Finally, defendant claimed that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Because the record lacked evidence, however, as to his counsel's reasons for his actions, the appellate court could not conclude counsel's performance was deficient.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he asserted defects in both the indictment and the statute under which he was convicted and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The indictment alleged he knowingly disposed of used oil on land. The indictment implicitly negated both exceptions set forth in Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect; 7.176. By alleging defendant acted &quot;knowingly,&quot; the State negated the first exception, which stated the statute did not apply to one who unknowingly disposed of certain products into the environment. The indictment also alleged he disposed of used oil &quot;on land.&quot; The second exception provided that &sect; 7.176(a)(2) did not apply if the mixing or commingling of used oil with solid waste that was to be disposed of in landfills was incident to and the unavoidable result of the mechanical shredding of motor vehicles, appliances, or other items of scrap, used, or obsolete metals. The indictment used sufficient language to apprise defendant of the act he committed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The trial court denied his application for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, appellant contended that the trial court erred because he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel, he was entitled to file an out-of-time appeal, and the statute under which he was convicted was applied ex post facto and was otherwise void for vagueness. The court held there was no ex post facto application of the statute because appellant was convicted under a version of the statute in effect at the time of the offense. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to not challenge the indictment or jury charge regarding guilt/innocence because the statute was not vague and the results at trial would not have been different had counsel made such challenges. Appellant never manifested his desire to the trial court to appeal his conviction so as to appoint appellate counsel.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was not entitled to habeas corpus relief because the results would not have been different had appellant's trial counsel challenged the applicable statute on ex post facto or vagueness grounds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The County Criminal Court of Appeals, Dallas County, Texas, cited appellant resident for violating appellee city's high grass and weeds ordinance. The resident appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident claimed that the city violated his due process rights by not properly putting him on notice of a high grass and weeds violation and by allowing an arbitrary enforcement of an unconstitutionally vague ordinance. The appellate court noted that to preserve an issue on appeal from a municipal court, the resident had to raise the identical point in his motion for new trial. He did not specifically argue in his motion for new trial that his due process rights were violated because the &quot;High Grass and Weeds Notification&quot; did not provide him proper notice. The resident failed to properly preserve his issue for review. The notice established that the resident's property was violating the ordinance at the time of the letter and further provided him a time frame for correcting the problem. If he failed to do so, the notice explicitly stated the possible consequences. The ordinance's plain language was not unconstitutionally vague. It provided explicit standards for its application. The resident did not cite any evidence that the officer singled him out for violating the ordinance or that code enforcement officers differed in their application of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The dentist pleaded the affirmative defense of the limitations provision set forth in Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.251 (2003), which the trial court granted. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents argued that the trial court erred in granting the dentist's motion for summary judgment because the limitations period set forth in Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.251 (2003) violated the open courts provision contained in Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 as applied to minors. The appellate court initially noted that Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.251 (2003) was virtually identical to its predecessor, former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01. The appellate court found that former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 was unconstitutional when applied to a minor because it violated the open courts provision set forth in Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The appellate court held that while there was a legitimate purpose of restraining the escalating cost of liability insurance for health care providers, the means used to achieve that purpose was not reasonable when they were weighed against the effective abrogation of a child's right to redress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a citizen of Mexico. A grand jury approved four counts against defendant, including murder. Defendant was adjudicated delinquent and received a 30-year determinate sentence, with a possible transfer. The trial court later set a date for a transfer hearing and ultimately ordered defendant transferred. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because the record did not indicated that defendant presented the specific complaint to the trial court, defendant failed to preserve the issue for review under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1), and thus the court did not need to consider whether Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 54.11 was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. Defendant improperly briefed the issue of whether Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 54.11 was unconstitutional on its face. Assuming that the issue was properly preserved under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1), the order that transferred defendant to another institutional division recited that due notice had been issued under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 54.11(b), (d), and the court was free to presume the regularity of recitations like this, given that the record supported the recitation in the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was performing court ordered community service at a TPWD operated park, and was assigned to trash collection. A TPWD employee drove the claimant around in a pickup truck so that he could empty trash barrels and remove litter from the roadside. The claimant rode in the bed of the pickup. While the pickup was moving, the claimant fell from the back of the truck, suffering significant injuries. The claimant sued the TPWD, alleging that the TPWD driver had negligently operated the truck, resulting in his fall and injuries. The TPWD filed a plea to the jurisdiction, alleging that sovereign immunity barred the suit. The appellate court ruled that the trial court erred in denying the TPWD's plea to the jurisdiction. The claimant's pleadings affirmatively negated the existence of subject matter jurisdiction. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.20(b) stated that the Texas Tort Claims Act did not apply to a claim based on an act by a state employee related to a community service program. The plain language of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.20(b) supported the TPWD's assertion that the Texas Tort Claims Act was inapplicable to the claims asserted by the claimant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was placed on deferred adjudication community supervision, the State filed a motion to revoke and sought an adjudication of guilt. Defendant answered &quot;true&quot; to 16 out of 20 of the allegations presented by the State in support of its motions. The trial court revoked community supervision and imposed 8-year concurrent sentences. Defendant appealed, alleging that the sentences imposed were disproportionate to the offenses, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. In affirming, the appellate court determined that defendant failed to properly preserve the complaint for appellate review. Defendant was required to present a timely objection to the trial court, and constitutional errors were subject to waiver due to a failure to object. Here, defendant did not object to the sentence during the hearing. The sentences imposed were not illegal, and they fell within the permissible range of punishment. The Lovejoy case did not apply to these circumstances. Defendant's rights asserted for the first time on appeal were not so fundamental as to have relieved her of the necessity of a timely and specific objection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When responding to a complaint of a prowler, a police officer discovered defendant videotaping into a house. He was arrested for disorderly conduct, and the video camera was seized during a search incident to arrest. While defendant was in custody, the tape inside the camera was viewed without a warrant. Defendant admitted that he taped females through their bedroom windows for purposes of sexual gratification. After he was convicted of improper videotaping, defendant sought review. In affirming, the appellate court rejected defendant's assertion that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.15(b)(1) (Supp. 2006) was unconstitutional as overbroad under the First Amendment. Even if defendant had cited several examples to the trial court, they were insufficient to meet the burden of showing that the statute met a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. Moreover, the plain language of the statute narrowed the proscribed conduct. Next, his motion to suppress was properly denied. Defendant did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment and Tex. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who was 16 years old, was charged with capital murder. He was tried as an adult. The State presented evidence that he murdered two individuals during a single criminal transaction and then tried to cover up his crime by burning the victims' bodies in a house fire. The jury found him guilty as charged. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The court of appeals upheld the judgment. On review, the court found that appellant failed to establish that there was a national consensus against imposing life without parole on a juvenile for the offense of capital murder. A juvenile capital offender's moral culpability, even if diminished as compared to that of an adult capital offender, was still great. Life without parole for juvenile capital offenders found justification in the penological goals of retribution and incapacitation but not in the goals of deterrence or rehabilitation. Appellant did not carry his burden of showing that, according to contemporary national standards of decency, punishment of life without parole for juvenile offenders was grossly disproportionate to the offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the 79th Judicial District Court, Brooks County, Texas, convicting her of failing to stop and render aid in violation of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 550.023, sentencing her to one year in county jail, and fining her $ 5,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for leaving the scene after her vehicle struck and killed the victim. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contentions that &sect; 550.023 was unconstitutional because: (1) &sect; 550.023 did not implicate any rights that the United States Supreme Court had classified as fundamental; (2) there was no dispute that the conduct defendant allegedly committed was prohibited by &sect; 550.023(3), and therefore the statute was not void for vagueness, because defendant was driving, hit someone, did not stop, and did not provide any assistance; and (3) the statute did not violate the Establishment Clause just because it was allegedly consistent with religious views that all drivers be good Samaritans. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because: (1) it was undisputed that the victim was hit by a vehicle that did not stop; (2) scientific evidence proved that the blood on defendant's vehicle matched that of the victim; and (3) after defendant reported her car stolen, she spoke to a 911 dispatcher and stated that she had hit a boy, although she ultimately testified that it was a different boy than the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee citizens sued appellant city in a Dallas County, Texas, trial court claiming that an ordinance in which the city required that owners and others exercising control of nonexempt commercial buildings obtain a certificate of registration was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the citizens summary judgment. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed the ordinance in question on September 28, 1994, but rescinded the fee requirement in 1995, but it did not make the rescission retroactive. The citizens were issued citations for failure to comply with the ordinance, but they paid the registration fee in exchange for the dismissal of the citations. On October 19, 1998, over four years after the city passed the ordinance, the citizens filed their lawsuit. On appeal, the city argued that it conclusively established all of the elements of its limitations claim. The appellate court noted that a two-year statute of limitations applied to a challenge to the constitutionality of a taking, and that limitations began to run when a cause of action accrued. The appellate court held that even though the citizens designated their challenge an &quot;as applied&quot; challenge, they actually presented a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the ordinance. The appellate court concluded that it was not a particular application that gave rise to the fee, it was solely the passage of the ordinance that gave rise to the fee; thus, the two-year statute of limitations applied and summary judgment should have been entered for the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and judgment was rendered that the citizens take nothing from the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents appealed from a take-nothing judgment entered by the 101st Judicial District Court, Dallas County, Texas, in a medical malpractice action for injuries to their child who received emergency medical care at appellee medical center. They claimed that the heightened standard of proof required by Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.153 (2011) violated the equal protection clauses of the Texas and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After settling with or dismissing all other defendants, the parents proceeded to a jury trial against the medical center. At the close of evidence, the jury was charged with the heightened standard of proof required by Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.153 (2011) for cases involving emergency medical care in certain facilities. The jury found that the emergency medical care rendered by the medical center was not performed with willful or wanton negligence. The appellate court held that the classification made by &sect; 74.153--between those who receive emergency medical care in certain facilities (i.e., a hospital emergency department), who must meet the heightened standard of proof, and those who receive emergency medical care in non-covered facilities, who must meet only the traditional standard of proof--did not violate the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 or Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 because the classification was rationally related to the State's legitimate interest in ensuring the provision and availability of emergency medical care for its citizens.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the conclusion that he made telephonic communications to the victim with criminal intent. He also asserted that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The appellate court found that the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence where the State was not required to disprove alternative reasonable hypotheses concerning an accused's intent. Defendant's assertion that there were other explanations for his conduct did not negate the evidence indicating that his actions were intended to annoy and harass the victim. It was not necessary for defendant to speak directly to the victim in order to communicate with her. The jury's verdict was based on the calls and messages that occurred after the victim first made a complaint to the police and before the date the information was filed. There was no authority for the proposition that making repeated telephone calls with the intent to annoy or harass another was protected by the First Amendment. The telephone harassment statute was not unconstitutionally vague in its application as it prohibited only a narrowly defined scope of activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged their respective convictions for failing to report child abuse, arguing the trial court erred in denying their motion to quash their information. They both argued the statute under which they were charged was facially unconstitutional and vague. First appellant's motion for immunity under Tex. Fam. Code &sect; 261.106 was also denied. The appeals court affirmed both orders. First, it held the statute was not vague as applied to appellants, because it was sufficiently clear, stating what conduct was proscribed. Appellant's conduct fell within this proscription, despite the fact that appellants failed to witness a particular instance of abuse. The court further upheld denial of immunity, reasoning that first appellant lied, telling police officers that the complainant did not live in her home. Thus, she failed to assist in the investigation in good faith, and not entitled to protection.</SPAN></P>

After pleading true to the enhancement paragraph of the indictment alleging a prior felony theft conviction, defendant was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 481.123(b)(2) was vague as applied to him. The appellate court found that defendant waived the &quot;as applied&quot; issue as he failed to raise it at trial. Even if he had not waived the issue, he failed to show that in its operation the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him; that it might be unconstitutional as to others was not sufficient. Appellant also raised a facial challenge to the statute by claiming the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it did not define the words &quot;designed&quot; and effect.&quot; Given the common, plain definitions of the words, and given that the statute targeted a specific induced &quot;effect,&quot; the appellate court could not say that the statute failed to give a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited. As such, the failure to statutorily define &quot;designed&quot; and &quot;effect&quot; did not render &sect; 481.123(b)(2)&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague on its face. Contrary to defendant's complaint, the fact that the state statute did not correspond with its federal counterpart did not render it unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his plea of not guilty, defendant was convicted by a jury of aggravated robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After engaging a street prostitute, the victim was assaulted and robbed by defendant when he entered an abandoned house at the direction of the prostitute. Among other things, according to the evidence, defendant brandished a gun and then inflicted a three inch cut on the victim's elbow with a knife as the victim was attempting to defend himself. On appeal, defendant contended his conviction for aggravated robbery was obtained via a combination of statutes which were unconstitutionally facially vague. He argued the statutes--particularly Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 29.03--elevating robbery to aggravated robbery via the use or exhibition of a &quot;deadly weapon&quot; did not give the person of ordinary intelligence sufficient information to determine what the aggravated robbery provision prohibited. The appellate court disagreed. It held that &sect; 29.03 was not unconstitutionally vague considering the evidence in the case. Defendant's argument that there was conflicting testimony regarding the manner in which he used the knife. Whether the thrust of the knife that caused a three-inch wound was best described as a jab, stab, or swing of the arm and hand was not controlling as the effect was the same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose out of a gang-related drive-by shooting.

Defendant was acquitted of the murder and attempted murder charges but was convicted of tampering with evidence. Although the State failed to file written notice of the action not less than 30 days before trial, pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 3.02(b) the court concluded that the error was harmless under Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b) because defendant received adequate notice of the joinder. The denial of defendant's motion to sever offenses under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 3.04 was also harmless error. Because defendant was acquitted of the murder and attempted murder charges, she could not complain of the denial of her motions under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 36.09 (1981) to sever defendants. The evidence was sufficient. Defendant's self-incrimination argument under the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the 337th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which, in an aggravated assault case, denied defendant's motion for post-conviction DNA testing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the punishment phase of trial, the State produced evidence that the victim had been sexually assaulted. Pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 64.03(a) (Supp. 2004-2005), defendant filed a motion for post-conviction DNA testing. The motion did not challenge the constitutionality of art. 64.03(a). After a hearing, the trial court, finding that identity had never been an issue in the case, denied the motion. On appeal, defendant argued that art. 64.03(a) was unconstitutional. The court, in affirming, stated that an as applied constitutional challenge to a statute was waived under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1) when it was not asserted at the trial court level. Thus, defendant could assert only a facial constitutional challenge, in which he argued that permitting post-conviction DNA testing only when the evidence was relevant to the guilt phase did not give convicted persons a meaningful remedy to challenge their punishments. The court found no merit in defendant's facial challenge because neither the United States Constitution nor the Texas Constitution contained a requirement to provide post-conviction DNA testing to any convicted person.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the County Criminal Court at Law No. 2, Harris County, Texas, for violating a municipal ordinance prohibiting persons from riding a bicycle on the street when a bicycle path was available and fined $ 100. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance that provided if a bicycle path was available, a cyclist could not ride his or her bicycle on a public street. A police officer warned defendant to ride her bicycle on the adjacent pathway instead of in the street and when she did not comply, the officer issued her a ticket. On appeal, defendant argued the ordinance was unconstitutional in that it was impermissibly vague. The State responded defendant waived her challenge to the constitutionality of the statute as applied to her. The appellate court initially noted a statute was vague if a person of ordinary intelligence was required to guess at its meaning. The appellate court held the city ordinance was perfectly comprehensible based upon its plain language in that a bicyclist could not ride on a public road if there was a usable bicycle path next to the road. The appellate court concluded the ordinance was not a violation of equal protection because bicyclists could not be considered a suspect class and the ordinance did not impinge on constitutionally-guaranteed interstate travel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, the buyers, filed suit in the 298th Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas) seeking to prevent appellant, the district, from removing the exemptions from the buyers' property. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the buyers' motion for summary judgment, and denied the district's motion for summary judgment. The district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prior owner of the buyers' home claimed and received exemptions from the appraised value of the property available under the tax code to owners of a residence homestead over 65 years of age. After the prior owner died, the buyers purchased the property. The buyers' title company acquired from a private business a certificate showing no taxes were due on the property. The district later determined that the property was not qualified for the residence homestead and over-65 exemptions after the prior owner's death. The district removed the exemption, generated additional ad valorem property taxes against the property, and alleged there was a tax lien on the property for the additional amount of taxes owed. The buyers sued the district and won. The court of appeals held that the Texas Tax Code imposed a tax lien on real property based on a back-appraisal to remove erroneously claimed exemptions regardless of whether the property was sold by the party who benefitted from the exemptions. Also, the Texas Constitution did not prohibit such a lien.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment granting the buyers' motion for summary judgment and denying the district's motion for summary judgment was reversed. Judgment was rendered for the district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant student sought review of an order from the 352nd District Court of Tarrant County (Texas), which awarded a take-nothing judgment to appellee school district in an action for violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an anonymous tip, school officials found a thimble-full of a substance that smelled like alcohol in a water bottle in the student's vehicle while it was parked on school property. Based on the finding, the school district's zero tolerance policy required the student's removal from the high school and placement in an alternative school. The student brought an action against the district for violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court signed a take-nothing judgment in favor of the district. On appeal, the court found that the student failed to show that the district's zero tolerance policy operated unconstitutionally as applied to him. The student suffered no deprivation of procedural due process or substantive due process because there was a way for him to obtain consideration of his mens rea, to present evidence that he lacked knowledge of the water bottle and its contents, and to thereby circumvent continued application of the zero tolerance policy. The student received hearings before the vice principal, the principal, an administrative appeal panel, and the superintendent. No evidence was presented by the student to escape application of the zero tolerance policy.</SPAN></P>
