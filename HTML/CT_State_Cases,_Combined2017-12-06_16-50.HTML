</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a local redevelopment commission, initiated a condemnation proceeding against defendant property owners. The property owners filed a separate action seeking a permanent injunction against the commission's condemnation proceeding. Following the trial court's denial of their request for injunctive relief, the owners filed an appeal that led to a reversal. Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 48-17a, the owners moved for attorneys fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission argued that the property owners were limited to fees incurred in connection with the condemnation action only, and were not entitled to fees associated with their action for injunctive relief. The commission further argued that the property owners were not required to commence a separate action to challenge the validity of a taking. The trial court found that although the property owners were initially denied such relief at the trial court level, the appellate court subsequently reversed the trial court's decision, and remanded the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment granting the property owners' claim for a permanent injunction. The appellate court decision allowed the property owners to seek, among other things, attorneys fees actually incurred because of the condemnation proceedings. Finally, the trial court found that, in accordance with the appellate court's order, the motion for attorneys fees was not filed late.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father sued defendants, the State, the Department of Children and Families (DCF), the Commissioner of the DCF, and several employees of the DCF. The father sought a declaratory judgment that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-101g was unconstitutional under the United Stated and Connecticut Constitutions. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The father filed objections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that they were entitled to summary judgment because (1) the father's claim for declaratory relief was not justiciable, (2) the claims for declaratory relief were insufficient as a matter of law, in that defendants acted, at all times, in accordance with constitutional statutory authority, (3) the issue raised by the father--the taking of a minor child without a pre-deprivation hearing--had already been resolved in their favor by the courts, and (4) the statutes at issue were all constitutional under the Connecticut Constitution. The court held that the claims presented by the father were justiciable because the father had alleged sufficient facts to establish that he had standing. Specifically, the father alleged that the DCF, through defendants, violated his due process rights, thus causing him injury. However, defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the statutory provisions at issue were constitutional. The Connecticut Supreme Court had passed upon the language of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-101g and found the predecessor statute, when read together with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-129, to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sued defendant supervisors and coworker, alleging defamation by the coworker and violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 by the supervisors. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction based on sovereign and statutory immunity. The motion was granted. The employee's motion to reconsider was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were employed at a state correctional institution. The coworker provided a supervisor with a written memorandum that contained defamatory and untrue statements about the employee. The employee alleged that as a result of the supervisors' failure to investigate her complaint, she suffered adverse employment actions. Defendants claimed that the employee's claims against defendants in their official capacity were prohibited by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and that the claims against them individually were barred by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165. The superior court concluded that the statements made by the coworker and the failure of the supervisors to investigate were actions in excess of their statutory authority; thus, they were not shielded from suit by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. As for &sect; 4-165, the superior court concluded that the coworkers' filing of a false report and making false statements might rise to the level of reckless disregard of rights or safety of others, and that the supervisors' failures to comply with an order to investigate reports of violence in the workplace was wanton, reckless, wilful, intentional, and malicious.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 52-584, -595.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents and minor filed their action against the obstetrician and defendant hospital, alleging that the minor suffered from multiple injuries as a result of the care and treatment before, during, and after the inducement of labor. The trial court granted summary judgment previously to the hospital. The obstetrician filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations contained in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584 because the minor was born over five and a half years prior to the time the complaint was served. Plaintiffs contended that the three-year limitations period was tolled until they saw the extent of the minor's injuries and that the obstetrician fraudulently concealed any cause of action, which also tolled the period. The court granted the obstetrician's motion, holding that the limitations period was not tolled because plaintiffs had failed to show any fraudulent concealment by the obstetrician. Additionally, there was no continuing course of conduct or special relationship between the obstetrician and the minor that caused the limitations period to be tolled, where she did not treat the minor or mother after delivery.</SPAN></P>

The attorney moved to dismiss pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super.

The client suffered no prejudice or harm due to his allegations that the attorney rendered pre-trial ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, there was no allegation by the client that any of the attorney's actions resulted in any conviction of the client or that any conviction had been invalidated prior to the instant action's filing. The attorney also moved to dismiss based on the client's failure to exhaust the administrative remedy under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165.

The truck drivers claimed that the accident occurred because of the negligence of the off-duty state policemen responsible for safety of a highway construction project. The court determined that since the policemen were engaged in extra activity that was specifically authorized by statute, and were not acting in abuse of their authority, both they and the highway agency that employed them were immune from liability. The truck drivers and truck owners could not bring an apportionment complaint against the administrator alleging the decedent's own responsibility, but they could raise her contributory negligence as a special defense. The administrator could not seek an award of multiple damages from the truck owners, because the terms of the authorizing statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295, referred only to awards against an actual driver. Finally, the administrator's complaint was insufficient to allege a recklessness count against one of the drivers, where it only alleged that he was paying insufficient attention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant proposed to develop six lots. The six lots in question all had the requisite road frontage, and each would have had a septic system and well. The court ruled that where the record did not contain sufficient substantial evidence to support the findings of an administrative agency, the court was to reject them. Where a court determined that an agency's interpretation of a statute was not plausible or reasonable, the court should not defer to such interpretation. The court found that the zoning commission did act unreasonably, arbitrarily and abused its discretion and sustained the appeal. The record failed to disclose any basis for the zoning commission's decision other than the condition of the road on which the proposed lots fronted. However, the applicant should not have been put into a position of not being able to subdivide its property. The property was properly zoned and the requisite frontage was available. Further, the construction of two residences across the roadway from the subject property had been allowed and permitted upon receipt from the property owners of waivers of future requests to improve the road.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-148 required claims against the State to be filed within a year, even though the general medical malpractice limitations period set by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-584 was two years. The executrix did not decide to pursue a medical malpractice action until several years had passed, claiming she had no idea that the treatment rendered amounted to malpractice, so she sought relief from the one-year filing period, as permitted by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-148(b), by means of a private bill, 1996 Conn. Spec. Acts 16. The court held, however, that the special legislation violated the public emoluments clause of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, because its sole objective was to grant the executrix a special advantage. This was not a situation in which the State had contributed to the delay--the executrix had been familiar with the facts surrounding the patient's death from the very beginning. Thus, the special act would have excused the commencement of the running of the admittedly shorter limitations period in a manner that was not available to other potential plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

The mother and the child alleged that the father sexually abused the child. The mother interfered with the paternal grandparents' visitation rights to the child. The child at times refused to see the paternal grandparents. The court determined that it had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the action. The court found that the only harm to the child was the ongoing pursuit of visitation and/or custody by the paternal grandparents. Therefore, the court would be doing irreparable damage to the child by removing her from the care and custody of her mother and the only family she had ever known. Not only would the change of custody be devastating to the child, but the child would be moved from Connecticut where the mother resided to Florida where the paternal grandparents resided. This would make frequent contact with the child's mother, half-brother, and maternal grandmother impossible. Further, it was not in the child's best interest to transfer custody to the father because the child did not have a relationship with her father and the father seemed indifferent to having custody.</SPAN></P>

The court ordered the property to be given to the mother, but, when the mother went to the father's home, the only property that could be found was a washer and a dryer. The mother then asked for a monetary award compensating her for the value of her property that was improperly disposed of by the father in violation of what was claimed to be an operative and valid court order. The court found that the court did have jurisdiction to decide the contempt matter on the merits. Further, the father had no right, under the circumstances, to violate court orders regarding the property and to thwart the court's inherent power to review the correctness of its judgment upon the filing of a motion for articulation. Accordingly, the court entered a monetary award for the missing property on behalf of the mother.</SPAN></P>

The landlord sued one council member for violation of due process, sued the other council member for refusal to release a lien, sued the town for the acts done by the town council members in their official capacities, and sought injunctive relief ordering the town to release a lien.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town relocated tenants of the landlord's property because the property was uninhabitable. Without notice, the town filed a relocation lien on the property. When the landlord sold the property, funds to pay for the relocation expenses were placed in escrow. The court found that, because fundamental tenets of procedural due process were not followed, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-270 was unconstitutionally applied and that the landlord was deprived of a constitutionally protected property interest without due process. Further, the allegations against the town council members in their official capacities and the town were proved. However, compensatory damages were not proved. Additionally, the landlord was entitled to injunctive relief returning the escrowed funds, because no notice was provided. However, the town was entitled to a setoff for the relocation expenses at the statutory cap amount under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 37-3a. Finally, the landlord was entitled to a consideration of attorneys fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a city and a city building inspector, sought summary judgment on plaintiff building owners' complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inspector declared the owners' building unsafe and served notice that it would be demolished unless repairs were made. The owners did not comply and the building was destroyed. The owners asserted that the city induced them to believe that it would forbear from demolition while investigating restitution, a claim that was denied by the city and the inspector. The owners instituted suit and the court granted summary judgment for the city and the inspector on all counts except for the IIED claim. The court held that the owners' negligence claim was barred by the qualified immunity conferred on the inspector and the city by the common law and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-557n(a)(2)(B). The owners' equitable estoppel claim failed because they failed to demonstrate that they were induced not to act by the official with authority over the demolition of buildings. The city and the inspector did not demonstrate what the facts were with respect to the IIED claim, thereby precluding summary judgment. Finally, as a matter of law, the city was entitled to summary judgment on the owners' claim that it was required to indemnify the inspector for what the owners alleged to be intentional misconduct.</SPAN></P>

The complaint, against the official and the social worker in both their official and their individual capacities, was in two counts: one based on Conn. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father had ongoing conversations with child welfare officials about his concerns about the custodial mother's parenting abilities, but the child was still living with her mother when the mother killed her. The court held that since there was no showing that the state employees acted in excess of their statutory authority or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute, there could be no action against them in an official capacity. There was no showing of reckless or malicious conduct as required for individual liability. Furthermore, Connecticut's high court had explicitly refused to recognize a private cause of action based on deprivation of fundamental rights under the state constitution in situations where the normal process for making claims against the state provided a possible remedy. The father's federal civil rights claim, alleging denial of substantive due process, also failed, because there was no special relationship or state-created danger giving rise to liability in a situation where the state did not have custody of the child.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 41-9 did not bar defendant's motion to dismiss, as he had not been arrested by a warrant. However, the State proffered sufficient evidence to avoid dismissal. Defendant argued that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-181(a)(1), -182(a)(2) were overbroad and vague. The court ruled that the Connecticut Supreme Court had saved the statutes from facial vagueness and overbreadth by applying judicial gloss. The mens rea language of both statutes indicated the predominant intent was to cause what a reasonable person operating under contemporary community standards would consider a disturbance to or impediment of a lawful activity, a deep feeling of vexation or provocation, or a feeling of anxiety prompted by threatened danger or harm. Since defendant's actions were not an exercise of free speech or assembly, the statutes were not unconstitutional as applied. Defendant's arrest was not illegal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an employee, brought an application against defendant, the owner and lessor of the building where she worked, seeking to conduct air quality testing in the leased area where she worked. The State of Connecticut and two of its departments were also named as defendants. The State moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee contended that continued daily exposure to the ambient air in the building was hazardous to her and all other persons in the building. The State's motion to dismiss was based on (1) sovereign immunity, (2) failure to exhaust administrative remedies and (3) lack of standing. The court first determined that the nature of the proceeding was a bill of discovery. The central issue was, thus, whether a bill of discovery directed against the State was subject to sovereign immunity. It was necessary to determine whether there was probable cause that the employee would ultimately be entitled to relief from any other party, specifically the owner. The court answered yes because the owner, as landlord, retained a duty to maintain the premises. Next, it concluded that because the bill of discovery no longer contained a claim for damages, the application was not defeated by sovereign immunity. As to exhaustion, the court held that the State had not met its burden of persuasion that the employee was obliged to invoke the grievance and arbitration procedure of the then-expired collective bargaining agreement. Finally, the court rejected the State's standing argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Treating the employee's complaint as a bill of discovery, the motion to dismiss was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff abutting owner (abutter) asked for a temporary injunction to restrain conveyances and challenged a decision of defendants department of transportation (DOT) and its commissioner canceling the auction of a parcel of defendant state's land three days before bids were scheduled to be opened. The DOT, commissioner, state, and defendant department of environmental protection moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motions were based upon the: (1) trial court lacking subject matter jurisdiction by virtue of the doctrine of sovereign immunity; (2) abutter lacking standing; and (3) the abutter failing to state a substantial claim that would entitle it to the relief sought. The trial court, in granting the motions, found the facts supported all grounds. The DOT offered abutting property owners the opportunity to submit sealed bids for the purchase of the parcel in a town. The bid form reserved to the state the right to unilaterally and without cause accept or reject any or all bids, to withdraw the invitation to bid at any time before or after bids were opened, and stated that the bidder agreed its proposal was to be tendered subject to all of the bid form's conditions. The commissioner cancelled the bid process before the bids were opened for a legislative bill to allow the property to be transferred to the town (it declined to buy the parcel under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;3-14b) for open space preservation.  Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 3-14b and 13a-80 did not make the bid process irreversible. Defendants were doing what was proper and expected under a democratic form of government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court, after finding that sovereign immunity exempted defendants from suit in this case and that reservation of the right to reject all bids: (1) was not in excess of the defendants' statutory authority; (2) did not undermine the integrity of the competitive bidding process; and (3) was not fraudulent, granted the motions to dismiss and dismissed the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners sued defendant town. Their claims arose from the town's alleged failure to maintain an access road to their homes in a passable condition as a public road. The town moved to strike the second, third, and eighteenth counts of the complaint on the ground that they failed to state legally sufficient claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The second count was stricken because there was no authority to support the landowners' argument that Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect;1, could apply where the plaintiff did not claim improper legislative action, and no appellate court or trial court had recognized a cause of action for monetary damages under that provision. Also, had the landowners sought subdivision approval, or any other permit or license necessary to develop their land, there were adequate statutory remedies available in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8. Also, the third count (a nuisance claim) was stricken because the facts as alleged did not describe an inherently dangerous condition with a natural tendency to inflict injury upon person or property, and the landowners did not allege that the obstruction in and of itself constituted a continuing dangerous condition, only that it prevented them from accessing their property. Finally, the 18th count (alleging a claim under Conn. Const. art. XXI) was stricken because the landowners' claim of being improperly taxed could, if true, be redressed through Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-111 and 12-117a.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, state board of trustees, state, and commissioner of education, filed a motion to dismiss in plaintiff parents' action that challenged the constitutionality of a specific act terminating the board of trustees' oversight of the city public school system. The parents also sought an injunction preventing the transfer of oversight power to a new city board of education.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a 1996 decision, the Connecticut Supreme Court rendered declaratory relief in favor of the 18 school children who sought the relief. While the supreme court retained jurisdiction in the case, it stayed the action to allow the legislature to formulate a remedial measure in the case. The legislature passed 1997 Conn. Acts 4 (Spec. Sess.), which dissolved the city board of education and created the state board of trustees to oversee the city public school system. 2001 Conn. Acts 7 (Spec. Sess.) extended the board of trustees' oversight. On the last day of this extension, the board of trustees' duties were to be transferred to a new city board of education. The supreme court remanded the children's case, and the issues were under review in the remand court. The prior pending action doctrine required dismissal of the parents' action. The parents in the instant case and the children in the prior pending action were similar parties. The same issues were presented in both actions, as the parents and children sought declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy educational inequities in the public school system. These issues were already under consideration by the remand court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner minor child filed a motion seeking to invalidate or open a prior paternity acknowledgement which was filed by the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS) pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-172. Alternatively, the child sought an independent de novo adjudication of paternity by the court in an action commenced by plaintiff mother in which defendant father had acknowledged his paternity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and father had previously executed an acknowledgment of paternity at the DSS. Thereafter, the parties had twins which were acknowledged by the father, and all three children and the parents lived together. However, the child, through her guardian ad litem, sought to invalidate the acknowledgement of paternity. The court initially found that the child had standing to bring the motion, although no fraud was found. The fact that the father had stated that he was not the father was found to have been said in anger, and there was support for the proposition that he believed he was the father when he signed the acknowledgement, as did the mother. The court found that duress and mistake also were not available grounds to open the judgment. The court held that opening the acknowledgement would render it meaningless and declined to do so. It was also noted that there was no constitutional right of the child to a biological paternity determination. Although the court indicated that it would like to impose such a right, it found that it was within the legislature's genre to enact that type of right. The court ordered no child support, but directed payment of arrears.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the child's motion and directed payment of child support arrears.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 46b-59 action for visitation with two minor children borne to defendant birth mother after artificial insemination when the parties were living together in a lesbian relationship.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court, in granting the motion, summarized how the non-birth mother acted as a parent to the children, including (1) their emotional ties, (2) sharing the costs and experiences of the planning, insemination, birthing, and raising of the children. The breakdown of their relationship was not related to care of the children. The trial court distinguished the Roth v. Weston case where the Connecticut Supreme Court determined that, under &sect; 46b-59, the decision of a natural parent concerning visitation with third parties (there blood relations) was controlling and that, absent the essential facts, forced intervention by a third party seeking visitation was an unwarranted intrusion into family autonomy and that &sect; 46b-59, in light of the United States Supreme Court's Troxel decision, the Roth lower court had unconstitutionally applied &sect; 46b-59 to allow visitation. The trial court found its &sect; 46b-59 jurisdictional, and also visitation, requirements were met by clear and convincing evidence: the non-birth mother (1) had a parent-child relationship, and (2) denial of her visitation would cause Conn.

She received a variance from the board and began construction. The neighbors successfully appealed and the zoning officer revoked the building permit. A second variance was received and the addition was completed. The neighbors successfully appealed again causing the zoning officer to order removal of the addition. The landowner's motion to strike was premised on the ground that the neighbors, as intervenors, could not raise special defenses, and the defense of waiver and estoppel could not be raised in an administrative appeal. The superior court held that the neighbors could assert as special defenses the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata. The superior court reasoned that party's are granted intervenor status to protect their interests; thus, they should be permitted to do so. As for the waiver and estoppel defense, the superior court noted that said defenses are permitted during an administrative appeal. The defenses merely attempted to prevent the landowner from litigating a right which had been litigated more than once before.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate sued defendants, the commissioner of the department of correction and eight of its officers. Defendants moves to dismiss on the grounds that (1) the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the case was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity, (2) the inmate failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and (3) the court lacked personal jurisdiction because of insufficiency process and service of process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate sought money damages, court costs, and any other reasonable and proper relief for defendants' alleged actions in (1) the use of unnecessary force, (2) wrongfully giving him a disciplinary report for assaulting an officer, and (3) erring in his hearing procedures. The inmate sufficiently pled facts to indicate that defendants used unnecessary (more than required by their statutory duty) force to move him between cells while he was subdued by handcuffs and leg restraints. The doctrine of sovereign immunity did not, therefore, deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. The inmate sufficiently pled that he exhausted his administrative remedies by pleading that defendants or their representatives refused to allow him further appeals. The trial court had personal jurisdiction over defendants by (1) by personal service on Connecticut's Assistant Attorney General accomplishing personal service on defendants under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-57, and by (2) giving the inmate 30 days under the trial court's Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 8-5(b) discretion to submit an affidavit of his financial status to pay, as Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-185(a) required, costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant's license was suspended for a year following a drunk driving conviction. The applicant was a veteran and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and vision loss in his left eye. He was totally disabled. The applicant filed with the department of motor vehicles, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-37a, an application for a special operator's permit. The Commissioner denied the application, because the applicant was not employed, and work permits were issued for work purposes only. The applicant then filed the instant action. The reviewing court found that the applicant's claim was not justiciable, because a ruling that &sect; 14-37a was unconstitutional would not have resulted in practical relief to the applicant. Because the applicant did not work, &sect; 14-37a was inapplicable to him. The applicant lacked standing to challenge &sect; 14-37a, because he had no specific legal interest in the constitutionality of &sect; 14-37a and was not aggrieved. The applicant had no legally protected interest in the subject matter of &sect; 14-37a. He was neither directly nor indirectly harmed by the Commissioner's power to grant a special driving permit to working persons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State moved to strike the 16 special defenses raised by defendant inmate in response to the State's attempts, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-85a, to obtain reimbursement of its costs of incarcerating him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several years after the inmate pled guilty to a crime and began serving his prison term, the legislature enacted Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-185a, which permitted the State to sue those prison inmates who had financial resources and recover the costs of incarceration. A while after that, the inmate was awarded a large sum in a personal injury action, and the State sued to recover incarceration costs. The court rejected outright most of the inmate's constitutional challenges to the statute as applied to him, because it was a civil matter and because it bore a rational relationship to the State's interest in encouraging responsibility. Thus, it dismissed for failure to state a claim arguments based on concepts such as bills of attainder, ex post facto laws, double jeopardy, uncompensated takings, equal protection, deprivation of wages, and substantive due process. Several claims survived the State's motion to strike for failure to state a claim, particularly those alleging retroactive application of the statute, the adoption of regulations thereunder, and the manner in which the inmate's obligation was calculated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court struck 10 of the special defenses but denied the State's motion as to the remaining defenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner applied to conduct certain regulated activities within a designated wetlands area. The landowner sought to fill a portion of her land for a residential home. Defendant Conservation Commission of the Town of Waterford (Connecticut) denied the application. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's lot was nearly all wetlands. The court ruled that, on appeal, a reviewing court needed to uphold an agency action unless such action was arbitrary, illegal, or not reasonably supported by the evidence. The plaintiff had the burden of showing that the record did not support the agency action. There was evidence that the proposed activities would have had a deleterious effect on wildlife that existed in the wetlands on the landowner's lot. The thrust of the landowner's evidence was that the wetlands on the lot were of low quality and regulated activities had been allowed on other property in the area. The landowner was given the chance to submit mitigating alternative plans but elected not to do so. There was nothing to indicate that the Commission would not have accepted such a proposal. The landowner also argued that the denial was an unconstitutional taking of her property. For an unconstitutional taking, it needed to be proven that the landowner was finally deprived of the reasonable and proper use of her property. The landowner failed to show this. She was at liberty to file a revised application, which might have been accepted by the Commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parcels were to be sold to the retailer who received permission from the city to develop the property with a 510,000 square-foot, six-story structure. The company subleased space to various subtenants. The proposed store would partially obstruct some views. The company was not obligated to pay and did not pay any federal or Connecticut state income tax. Its income flowed through to its partners who would or would not be taxed depending upon their income from the limited partnership and other sources. The company did pay real estate taxes to the city. The court held the company was not the owner of the property which would be affected and thus could not claim standing on that basis. The company failed to show the requisite injury necessary to establish standing because it had not demonstrated a direct injury as a taxpayer or that a settlement agreement, to which it was not a party, caused a net economic detriment to the city. There was no direct injury, as the sale of the parcels had no impact on city funds. Nor did the company have standing as a redeveloper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company's counts were dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as the company had no standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party filed a complaint against defendants, the Superior Court and the Appellate Court of Connecticut. He alleged that after a conviction in a criminal case, the superior court refused to waive the appellate filing fee, and that the appellate court denied his motion for a hearing and dismissed his appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought a dismissal based on the doctrine of judicial immunity. They argued that judges had absolute immunity from suit for all actions taken in the course of their judicial duties. The instant court granted defendants' motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction because defendants, as judges, were entitled to absolute judicial immunity. Further, the injured party failed to allege the necessary facts to invoke a waiver of sovereign immunity.

The trial court (1) rejected defendant's argument that his conviction for larceny could not be used because defendant committed the larceny before he was 18 years old; (2) held that defendant was entitled to challenge his prior conviction on grounds that it was based on a plea that was constitutionally invalid and entered without effective assistance of counsel; but (3) rejected defendant's challenge to his prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Department of Children and Families (DCF) brought an action against respondent biological father, seeking to terminate his parental rights (TPR) to his 12-year old daughter. DCF alleged that there was a failure by the father to rehabilitate and further, that there was a lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was in DCF custody for six years based upon a finding of neglect. Previously, it was found that reunification efforts between her and her father were inappropriate. The court noted that father had spent much of his adult life incarcerated and did not make efforts towards the court-ordered rehabilitation. The few visits that the child made to his prison proved extremely traumatic for her. She and her half-sister were happily living with a foster mother. The court concluded that DCF had proved by clear and convincing evidence that reasonable efforts towards reunification had been made pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-112(j)(1), that the father had not achieved statutory rehabilitation, and that there was no ongoing parent-child relationship. Viewing the matter in the context of the child's best interests, the court determined that TPR was appropriate in the circumstances. The court found it reasonable for DCF to propose a reunification plan and to also propose TPR as part of a permanency plan because the father had at least three more years of incarceration. The court also indicated that attacks on the constitutionality of &sect; 17a-112(j)(3)(B) lacked merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the father's parental rights be terminated, that the Commissioner of DCF be appointed the statutory parent, and that a permanency plan for the child be submitted, which would include an offer of adoption to her current foster mother.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, city and its personnel manager, moved for summary judgment on all five counts of plaintiff employee's complaint seeking damages for invasion of privacy and violation of constitutional and federal civil rights, as well as infliction of emotional distress, after the personnel manager allowed a reporter access to her personnel file under the Connecticut Freedom of Information Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-200 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Connecticut's freedom of information statute permitted the release of employee information to requesters, but only after a manager determined that release would not violate the employee's privacy and the employee had a right to appeal the decision to release. A city's personnel manager allowed a newspaper reporter unlimited access to the employee's file, which contained some embarrassing material, before she had a chance to try to prevent release. The court held that while this violated the statute, the violation did not give rise to a private cause of action for damages, and invasion of privacy was not a historic cause of action incorporated into Connecticut's common law by Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Furthermore, the employee had not suffered any physical harm normally required to recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress and the conduct was not outrageous enough to constitute intentional infliction. Although the city could not be liable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because there was no evidence that the release was in furtherance of a governmental policy or custom, further proceedings were required to determine whether the manager enjoyed qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion on the counts seeking damages under the governmental information statute and pursuant to Connecticut public policy, as well as on the counts for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, but it denied the motion as to the employee's count alleging constitutional and federal civil rights violations as against the personnel manager, as opposed to the city.</SPAN></P>

He had his girlfriend call police immediately, and had her call them again as he saw police exit the neighboring building with defendant in custody, to positively identify him. Police then conducted a show-up before they took defendant to the station. Defendant made various statements that evening, first admitting to the presence of drugs in his jacket, and, later, after executing a Miranda waiver, discussing the shootings. The court denied defendant's motion to suppress these items of evidence. Defendant's statement regarding the drugs was a spontaneous statement in response to the officer's inquiry regarding whether he wanted to wear a coat, so there was no interrogation. Once defendant had executed a waiver, police were not required to seek a second waiver to ask him about the murders. There was no state action involved in the witness's first identification, and, while the show-up was suggestive, it was necessary under the circumstances and bore strong indicia of reliability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The protestors were handing out literature at a circus being held on the state university grounds. The literature discussed the treatment of circus animals. The one supervising university police officer set up a protest area 300 feet away from the grounds where the circus was being held. The two university police officers arrested the protesters. The two university police officers eventually charged the protesters with a violation of Conn. Gen.

Two of the claims directed at the one supervising university police officer alleged that their free speech rights were violated regarding the protest area. The officers moved to dismiss counts two through seven.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent warden filed a motion to dismiss petitioner inmate's petition for habeas corpus on the grounds that the inmate failed to state grounds upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The warden asserted that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction of the petition because the proper place in which to litigate a matter that did not attack the legality of the confinement (commonly referred to as &quot;conditions of confinement&quot;) was through the use of a proceeding in the federal courts under the auspices of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Further, the warden asserted that allegations of unlawful restraints during exercise periods, such as the subject of this petition, did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The major thrust of the warden's argument was that the use of a writ of habeas corpus was not the appropriate mechanism by which to resolve &quot;conditions of confinement&quot; cases. After reviewing the history of writs of habeas corpus, the court concluded that the writ of habeas corpus was an appropriate vehicle by which a person in custody could contest the conditions of his or her confinement. Incarcerated persons had to have access to a post-conviction proceeding that permitted them to make a claim of nonjudgmental illegality of confinement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission adopted certain amended subdivision regulations. The land owner was the joint owner with his wife of some 35 acres of land, upon which they subsequently built a single-family residence.

The trial court denied the motion without prejudice to allow the land owner to prove on the trial date that he was an aggrieved party. Thereupon, the trial court found that there was no evidence that the land owner's property was specifically targeted by these amendments nor had he filed any application for his property under the subdivision regulations, as amended.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 21a-252(a), 21a-277(b), 21a-278(b) had been improperly combined to create a hybrid crime; and (4) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278(b) was vague and overbroad. The court concluded that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 21a-278(b), 21a-277(b) invoked the provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-252.  Conn. Gen. Stat.&nbsp;&sect; 21a-252(a) clearly set forth the conditions under which a physician could prescribe, administer, and dispense. It was only physicians who did not prescribe in good faith, for a demonstrable physical or mental disorder, and in the course of their professional practice, who were in violation of the statute. The statutes were clear and unambiguous.  Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-252(a) was sufficiently definite to enable a person of common intelligence to know what conduct was prohibited. Finally, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278(b) was a valid exercise of the legislature's police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Connecticut's water pollution statute, a remedial statute, gave the commissioner broad powers to regulate all kinds of discharges of water, in order to achieve the legislative goal of eliminating water pollution. The Commissioner argued in an enforcement action that at many of its store sites, the discount retailer failed to comply with the permits issued to it with respect to the discharge of storm water. The retailer argued that the water pollution statute was vague and overbroad and that, furthermore, it did not apply to storm water, which was not necessarily polluted. The court held that the legislation contained ample guidance for the Commissioner in regulating water discharges, so it was not unconstitutional. Furthermore, it was clear, construing the statute as a whole, that it regulated all kinds of discharges of water, which necessarily included storm water, which was also specifically identified in the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court had denied his motions and extended his commitment pending its decision. The acquittee claimed Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-593(c) violated Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8, 20 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The acquittee had been acquitted of assault by reason of mental disease or defect. The maximum punishment for assault was five years in prison. The court found the State had proven by clear and convincing evidence that the acquittee had a mental illness and would be a danger to others were he discharged from confinement. The court denied his motion to strike the board's report from consideration. The acquittee had a real and substantial liberty interest as to being re-committed. The fact that the acquittee was not entitled to periodic judicial review of his status resulted in a substantial risk of an erroneous and substantial deprivation of his liberty interest. The government's interest in existing procedures was outweighed by the acquittee's risk of an erroneous deprivation of his liberty interest. Accordingly, the court held Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-593(c) violated the acquittee's due process rights under Conn. Const. art I, &sect; 8. As there was no rational basis ground to support the disparate treatment of the acquittee, &sect; 17a-593(c) also violated his right to equal protection of the law under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF), brought an action to terminate the parental rights (TPR) of respondent parents in their infant son and to adjudicate the child uncared for and neglected based upon a bruise on the child's leg and the later discovery of broken leg bones.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court, in finding the son neglected and in denying the TPR petition, stated that the evidence clearly and convincingly established that the son's injuries were caused by an underlying bone condition with a substantive medical explanation, which adversely affected him in the absence of any act, acts, omissions, or commissions of any person. The son was more susceptible to bone breakage because of his low bone density. The son even broke another bone after being placed with caring foster parents. The evidence indicated the son's condition may have been inherited from the father. The expert upon which the court primarily relied was a pediatric orthopedic physician and surgeon, whose testimony related to bone density was supported by a radiologist. The parents were found to have neglected their son under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-120 since they did not get timely medical treatment for the son. The DCF did not prove Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-112(j)(1) failure to reunify by clear and convincing evidence. The DCF's efforts to reunify were described as too little. The parents had complied with offered services, and were loving and fit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court (1) adjudicated the son neglected because the parents failed to get the son timely medical treatment; (2) denied the TPR petition, as the DCF did not make sufficient efforts to reunify and because the parents did not commit statutory act, acts, or omissions adversely affecting the son; (3) found the parents to be fit and reunification to be in the son's best interest; and (4) established reunification requirements and schedules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, plaintiffs' main issue was the propriety of the department's decision to treat the combined gains from the sale of the company and the affiliate properties as &quot;regulated property gain,&quot; rather than treat the affiliate's gain from the sale as that of a separate unregulated entity that should not be credited to ratepayers. The appellate court concluded that the affiliate was unregulated in name only. The single purpose of the affiliate was to facilitate 100 percent financing for the benefit of ratepayers as opposed to a less aggressive financing technique that would be available to the public utility. Because the affiliate was created for the benefit of the ratepayers, it only made sense that ratepayers benefit from the affiliate's gain. Similarly, although the affiliate's property was not in the company's rate base, the company's lease payments, which funded all of the affiliate's principal repayments for that property, as well as the interest, depreciation, plant additions, and capital improvements, were included in the company's rate requirements.</SPAN></P>

The officers moved to dismiss the citizen's complaint on the ground that they were entitled to sovereign immunity and statutory immunity under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officers arrested the citizen without a warrant on a charge of criminal possession of a weapon. The issue was whether the citizen's complaint should be dismissed on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The citizen asserted that immunity was not available to the officers because the complaint alleged conduct clearly outside the scope of authority of the officers, with a culpable state of mind, which rendered immunity unavailable. The court concluded that the citizen had not alleged any facts that suggested that the officers' conduct was either outside the scope of their employment or that it was wanton, reckless or malicious. Therefore, the citizen's claims as alleged in the complaint were barred by the statutory immunity provided for in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165. There were no allegations of a misuse of governmental authority for the officers' personal gain nor were there any allegations that the officers acted with self-serving motives.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The planning commission held a public hearing to consider amendments to its subdivision regulations. Legal notice of the public hearing was published. It adopted the amendments to the subdivision regulations including certain contested amendments. The property owner owned 790 acres of property, approximately 600 of which were subject to the regulations. Thus, the property owner had standing. The decision as to whether more than 20 lots might be permitted in a particular subdivision was to be determined by the planning commission by reviewing the facts before it. Thus there was no justifiable claim before the court. However, certain regulations requiring off-site improvements exceeded the authority of the enabling statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-25. No statutory authority existed vesting the planning commission with the power to require bonds for private subdivision improvements or requiring a subdivision applicant to provide public access over subdivision land. The regulation regarding required open space was not a taking, as there had been no application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Rhode Island dissolution judgment granted the mother sole custody of the parties' minor child and visitation to the father, to be supervised by the paternal grandmother. The grandparents joined in the dissolution action and were granted reasonable rights of visitation. The instant motion to modify custody alleged that the mother was an unfit parent. She had been found in contempt for not allowing the father his visitation, and he claimed he had almost no contact with his daughter since she was very young. The mother argued that the court lacked jurisdiction under Roth v. Weston, which required a third party, such as the grandparents, who sought visitation under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 456b-59 to allege and establish a parent-like relationship as a jurisdictional threshold. The court held that Roth applied whether a non-parent sought visitation or custody. However, its standards applied only when parental fitness was not an issue, and defendants challenged the mother's fitness. Further, defendants pled facts which, if proven, would sufficiently demonstrate that there had been a substantial change in circumstances -- the mother's refusal to comply with visitation orders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant commissioner of consumer protection, in his official capacity, sued plaintiffs, an adoption agency and its director. After a court dismissed part of the case for lack of proof, the commissioner withdrew the whole case. Plaintiffs then sued the commissioner in his individual capacity for vexatious litigation. The commissioner moved for summary judgment, claiming that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that sovereign immunity did not apply since they sued the commissioner in his individual capacity. The court found that sovereign immunity applied if the suit was, in effect, against the State under the four Spring criteria. The first two criteria were met because a state official was being sued concerning a matter in which he represented the State. The third criteria was met because the State was the real party from which relief was sought since the alleged injury occurred while the commissioner was carrying out a duty entrusted to him by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110m of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA) as commissioner of a state agency. The fourth criteria was met because the judgment would control state activities by affecting how the consumer protection office would bring future unfair trade practices lawsuits against businesses. Thus, sovereign immunity applied. The commissioner did not act in excess of his statutory authority so as to lose his immunity because, even if he lacked probable cause for the CUTPA lawsuit, he did not continue to pursue it after the preliminary case was dismissed. Thus, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retired firefighters sued, among others, defendant city, claiming that the city violated applicable collective bargaining agreements regarding the retired firefighters' health care insurance plan. The retired firefighters sought injunctive relief to have the city reinstate them to indemnity health care plans previously in force and for money damages. The case was tried to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city decided to convert the retired firefighters from an indemnity style health plan to a managed care health plan. The court found that each of the retired firefighters who retired while he was covered by a collective bargaining agreement had a vested contract right to the specific health care plan to which that agreement referred. The city was not entitled to substantially modify the benefits or substitute a significantly different plan without the retiree's consent unless it was impossible to continue to provide the current plan. No legislation barred the city from providing vested health benefits to retirees. The rights of the retired firefighters to any particular health plan were governed by the collective bargaining agreements and contract law principles. The collective bargaining agreements were enforceable and obligated the city to provide to each retiree the health plan he elected on his retirement date. The parties intended to create a vested right to those health benefits. The retired firefighters would have suffered imminent and irreparable harm if compelled to switch health care plans and had no adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found for the retired firefighters and issued an order enjoining the city from involuntarily terminating any of the retired firefighters from the health care plan that was elected at the time of retirement, or otherwise involuntarily transferring, or enrolling any of the retired firefighters in managed health care plans. The court retained jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action for dissolution of marriage brought by plaintiff husband against defendant wife, intervenor primary caregivers sought to intervene by amended motion for the purpose of obtaining visitation with the minor child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The caregivers alleged that they were the primary caregivers to the minor child from January 1998 to December 2000. The child came into their care due to reports that the wife was getting out of an abusive marriage. The caregivers argued that they were the psychological parents to the child for all of the child's functional memory, and that the child had suffered and would continue to suffer severe emotional trauma in the sudden removal of the child from their care, especially in the absence of any other periodic contact, and that such emotional trauma was a real, actual, and significant harm to the child that could only be remedied by the requested visitation. Also, the child had reported to the caregivers that she had been touched in an improper way while staying overnight at the wife's house, by someone other than the wife. The court concluded that the caregivers' allegations, which were very specific, met the Roth test and entitled the caregivers to an evidentiary hearing. Proof of the allegations would satisfy the requirement of a finding of real and substantial harm to the child if visitation was not allowed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The court denies the motion to dismiss as to the first count, grants the motion as to the second count, and denies the dismissal of the defendants Bruckmann and the Public Defenders Services Commission from the action.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff client sued defendants, the Connecticut Public Defenders Services Commission and an attorney, alleging that (1) the attorney negligently failed to arrange an in-person identification, and (2) the claims commissioner's nine-and-a-half-year delay in considering his claim violated his civil rights and his state and federal due process and equal protection guarantees. Defendants moved to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client was incarcerated for 10 1/2 months because the attorney failed to arrange an in-person identification. The Connecticut General Assembly enacted a resolution allowing the client to sue defendants. Defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that the resolution was unconstitutional and violated the express provisions of the claims commissioner statutes. The court found that the special act at issue did not need to state a public purpose, did not create a preference or grant a personal advantage, and did not constitute an exclusive public emolument. Thus, it did not violate Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. In addition, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-159 did not set forth a jurisdictional standard, and the fact that the legislature passed the resolution necessarily implied that the legislature deemed it just and equitable, and believed the claim to present an issue of law or fact under which the state could be liable. Also, there was no inconsistency between Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4-148(c), 4-159. Finally, the second count was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity because sovereign immunity had not been waived with regard to the causes of action in the second count.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to dismiss as to the first count, granted the motion as to the second count, and denied the dismissal of defendants from the action.</SPAN></P>

The firefighters chose to have their pension benefits calculated under option one in the agreement. The firefighters thereafter applied for, and received, retirement and disability benefits.

The city indicated that it neglected to apply the base pay cap, as defined in the agreement, to the firefighters' disability pension plans. The firefighters argued, inter alia the record did not support the board's decision. The court held that the agreement was not definitive, as it was unclear whether the base pay cap applied to both service of years plans and disability plans. Additionally, the record did not contain any evidence relating to the formation of the collective bargaining agreement. Because the agreement was ambiguous, and there was a dearth of evidence regarding the formation of the agreement, the court could not affirm the board's decision to recalculate the firefighters' pension benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted petitioner prisoner of murder. On appeal, the appellate court found the evidence insufficient to prove murder and remanded with direction to modify the judgment to reflect a conviction of first-degree manslaughter. The prisoner was sentenced, and the sentence was affirmed on appeal. Thereafter, the prisoner filed a petition against respondent warden seeking habeas corpus relief, and the warden moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner argued that his conviction was unlawful, as the jury never considered an element of the offense of which he was convicted, that the appellate court was without authority to direct the conviction on an offense never considered by the jury, or to convict based on the sufficiency of the evidence to prove an element of the offense not considered by the jury, and that the manslaughter conviction was unconstitutional. The warden raised the defense of procedural default. In response, the prisoner claimed that the issues were not raised on appeal due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The court ruled that a claim already decided on direct appeal was not appropriate for re-litigation via a habeas corpus petition. A trial court was bound by supreme court precedent and was not at liberty to overrule or discard the decisions of the Connecticut Supreme Court. The prisoner's appeal from the murder conviction resulted in the manslaughter conviction. The court held that it had no authority to review the appellate court's decision to remand with direction to enter the manslaughter conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff special deputy sued defendant sheriffs and State for wrongful retaliation and violation of his rights to free speech, equal protection, and due process under the Connecticut Constitution. Defendants asserted special defenses including lack of subject matter jurisdiction, sovereign immunity, failure to exhaust administrative remedies, failure to mitigate damages, and statutory immunity. Defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The special deputy refused to sign a witness statement that he believed was false and an attempt to discipline another deputy. The deputy was then reassigned to a lower-paying position, and his applications for other positions were denied, in retaliation for his failure to sign the statement. In support of their motion to dismiss, defendants argued that, in the absence of allegations that the sheriffs acted in excess of their statutory authority or in excess of an unconstitutional statute, the doctrine of sovereign immunity applied. The deputy argued that the officials were not acting within the scope of their employment and, therefore, could not claim immunity. The superior court held that defendants were not entitled to sovereign immunity as a matter of law, because the allegations of the complaint supported a conclusion that defendants were acting solely to further an illegal or improper scheme of their own and not to carry out government policy. The court also held that defendants were not entitled to statutory immunity, as the alleged facts, if proven, could support a finding of reckless disregard for the just rights of the deputy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner served 1968 days of a non-suspended portion of his sentence, which was discharged. Petitioner admitted to violating his probation and the Superior Court, Hartford (Connecticut), imposed a two-year sentence to serve on the suspended portion of his sentence. Later, he was convicted again in New Britain and was sentenced three years to serve concurrent to the other sentence. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that petitioner was not entitled to the relief requested in his petition for habeas corpus. Respondent warden properly calculated petitioner's release date and, further, properly calculated his sentence. The August 6, 2002 release date was proper with respect to the violation of probation sentence. The warden determined that date by making adjustments for time already served on the original eight-year sentence, as well as any debits or credits from the original sentence. Since the three-year sentence had the longest term to run, the warden properly used that date as the controlling sentence. Based on the facts, the one continuous term principle was not the determinative rule, because the post October 1, 1994 sentence was controlling. Further, since the petitioner was convicted of some offenses occurring after October 1, 1994, the application of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-100d was not ex post facto as applied to those offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With only a few complications, the parties' post-divorce child support relationship had worked smoothly, and the father had remained generous and involved. When the mother decided that she no longer wanted to receive his payments directly, she sought a redirection of payments to the Connecticut Child Support Enforcement Bureau (bureau), pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17b-179. The father argued that such compulsion should not be necessary in a situation where he had not been delinquent and the children were not receiving public benefits. He was humiliated by receiving menacing official communications at home and work. The court held that once the process had begun, it had no discretion. Neither the Connecticut statute nor 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 654 and related provisions, which had compelled the state to enact its statute, allowed for any exercise of discretion by family court magistrates once the bureau had been invoked. Once it had been sought, redirection of payments was mandatory, and it would not be stopped by the absence of a delinquency or public benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff power company appealed the final decision of defendant Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC), which ordered the company to reduce nuclear stranded costs by the net proceeds from the sale of two parcels of land and disallowed $ 593,497 of expenses incurred in connection with that sale, in determining net proceeds available to offset stranded costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issues were whether: (1) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-245e(h)(4)(C) abrogated the common law rule that customers had no right to share in the gain from the sale of non-utility property; (2) the DPUC erred in denying the company recovery expenses of sale incurred in prior sale attempts; and (3) the DPUC erred in disallowing $ 88,415 of the company's internal labor costs. The court concluded that, based on the unambiguous language of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-245e(h)(4)(C) and the legislative history and purpose, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-245e abrogated the common law rule for the purpose of reducing an electric company's nuclear stranded costs. There was nothing ambiguous about the meaning of the word &quot;any&quot; in the context of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-245e(h)(4)(C)--it meant &quot;all.&quot; In addition, substantial evidence existed in the record to support the DPUC's finding that the expenses incurred by the company in its prior efforts to sell the parcels of land were not expenses of the present sale. Finally, there was substantial evidence in the record to support the DPUC's finding that the internal labor costs incurred in the present transaction were recovered by the company in rates.</SPAN></P>

The court held that as a result of his conviction for a capital felony, the prisoner could not earn or forfeit statutory good time. While a forfeiture of good time as a result of disciplinary violations triggered minimal due process requirements, the prisoner's interests in retaining his non-Security Risk Group/Security Risk Group Safety Threat Member classification, expunging from his record the disciplinary reports relating to his classifications of Security Risk Group/Security Risk Group Safety Threat Member, and restoration of all lost privileges were not legally recognized liberty interests that invoked due process protection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner appealed the property tax assessments made by defendant city. The property owner filed an offer of judgment. The city filed a motion to strike on the grounds that offers of judgment, in the tax appeal context, were legally insufficient and because the application of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-117a would constitute a denial of the city's equal protection and due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that (1) an offer of judgment was not permissible in a tax appeal seeking relief pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-117a; (2) tax appeals were essentially equitable in nature and thus, outside the scope of the offer of judgment statute; and (3) to the extent that the procedures that applied to the offer of judgment statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-192a, were deemed applicable to tax appeals, they created a significant disparity between the position of defendants and plaintiffs which violated the city's right to equal protection and substantive due process. Following guidance from the Connecticut Supreme Court, the court found that tax appeals pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-117a were civil actions and thus amenable to the offer of judgment statute and its procedures. Also, the equitable nature of tax appeals plus the money damages sought placed the case squarely within the type of case for which offer of judgments were utilized. Finally, the court found that offers of judgment were not unconstitutional, but did not find that the difference in the offer of judgment process in a tax appeal context amounted to a constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a tax appeal case, plaintiff taxpayer filed an offer of judgment pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 17-14 and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-192a(a). Defendant city moved to strike the offer of judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued an offer of judgment was not permissible in a tax appeal seeking relief pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-117a. Under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 14-6, administrative appeals were civil actions, and tax appeals fell within the Connecticut General Practice Book's definition of administrative appeals. Therefore, tax appeals pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-117a were civil actions amenable to the offer of judgment statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-192a(a). Offers of judgment were not covered by Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 10-39, as to motions to strike. The equitable nature of tax appeals plus the money damages the taxpayer sought placed the case within the type of case for which offers of judgment were utilized. Tax appeals' equitable nature did not exclude them from offers of judgment.  Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-192a(a) did not violate the city's equal protection right because the taxpayer and the city were not similarly situated and the judicial economy served by the statute met the rational basis test. There was no authority for the claim that the city's bargaining position, under &sect; 52-192a(a), violated equal protection or due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following her termination from the department of children and families, plaintiff employee filed a complaint against defendants commissioner, personnel officer, and supervisors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee claimed that pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-290a, she was wrongfully terminated after she filed for and received benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act. The court held that the factual scenario satisfied the four-part test for determining that defendants were being sued in their official capacities as they were state officials, and the claims involved actions made while representing the state. The liability for damages sought was that of the state, and any judgment against defendants would control the activities of the state, that is, the agency's relations with its employees. Next, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-51q waived sovereign immunity by its expressed terms. Further, the employee did not file her ADA claim with the claims commissioner. Thus, the court had no jurisdiction to hear her monetary claim. Finally, the employee did not sufficiently allege that defendants acted outside their statutory authority, nor did she allege the specific statutory authority. Also, the legislature did not statutorily waive the state's sovereign immunity as to claims for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.</SPAN></P>

No detainer was filed with the federal correctional authorities. Petitioner was released from federal custody and then retried and again convicted on the state charges. The court held that although the IAD expressed a policy favoring detainers, the State had no legal duty to file a detainer. Nor did petitioner reasonably claim a right to a speedy trial. Petitioner was not allowed to receive credit for the time spent in federal custody. His claim of prosecutorial misconduct did not afford any basis for a writ of habeas corpus. Nor was he entitled to relief on the basis of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant commissioner of the department of social services (DSS) placed a withholding order on assets owned by plaintiff father, a child support obligor, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-362d(d), (e). The father appealed. The primary issue was whether procedural due process required notice and a hearing before the placement of the withholding order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1990, a court ordered the father to pay child support. The father had not paid $ 135 per week for the 218 weeks between July 1, 1992, and August 31, 1996. The DSS had recovered $ 3,332 of the $ 29,430 gross delinquency and issued the &sect; 52-362d(d) withholding order for the $ 26,098 overdue balance. Four days thereafter, the DSS gave the father the required Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-362d(e) notice that the father could have an administrative hearing. The court, in dismissing the appeal, determined that it had plenary power to consider whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-362d(d), (e) was constitutional, but that the father did not carry his burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 52-362d(d), (e) was unconstitutional as a violation of procedural due process. The court applied a test balancing the father's private interests against public interest. The public interest in providing for a child's support was compelling. The father had in fact been ordered by a court to pay the support. Requiring the DSS to give notice to the father prior to the withholding order could frustrate its collection of sums due since financial institution balances could be easily moved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that procedural due process did not require notice and a hearing before placement of the withholding order and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus alleged that respondent warden illegally lengthened his term of imprisonment by not crediting him with statutory good time credits in violation of his due process rights and of Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-100d rendered all good time statutes inapplicable as to crimes committed after October 1, 1994. Petitioner's sentence in one case was for an offense that was committed after October 1, 1994, and the other five sentences were for crimes committed before &sect; 18-100d's effective date. The court noted that, in light of the multiple concurrent sentences, the warden had to determine which sentence had the longest to run. Applying good time credits earned by petitioner on his good time earning sentences to his non-good time earning sentence would violate the legislative intention that sentences imposed for offenses committed on or after October 1, 1994, would not earn good time. Further, petitioner's ex post facto argument failed because &sect; 18-100d did not apply to the his five good time earning sentences; instead, &sect; 18-100d applied to his non-good time earning sentence, which was imposed for an offense committed on or after October 1, 1994.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a child and his parents, sued defendants, a doctor and a hospital, alleging, inter alia, negligence involving the circumstances of the child's birth, his post-natal care, and fraudulent concealment of their claims against defendants. The hospital moved for summary judgment, alleging that the claims were filed after the three-year repose period of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584 and that there was no evidence of fraudulent concealment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the &sect; 52-584 period of repose, a medical malpractice action could not be brought more than three years after the negligent conduct occurred. The complaint was served beyond this three-year period. Plaintiffs argued that the period of repose was tolled by: (1) the continuing course of conduct doctrine, as the hospital had a special relationship to newborns and, thus, a continuing duty after the child left the hospital to inform his parents about his risks of permanent injury; or (2) by the hospital's fraudulent concealment of plaintiffs' causes of action. The superior court held that the continuing course of conduct doctrine did not save the action, as there was no basis to conclude that a special relationship existed giving rise to a continuing duty owed by the hospital to every newborn like the child and because there was no evidence that the hospital was aware of the risks of which it was supposed to have warned. Plaintiffs also failed to show fraudulent concealment, absent proof that the hospital knew that the child suffered, or would suffer, permanent injuries. Contrary to plaintiffs' final argument, &sect; 52-584 did not violate Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 or equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner sought a building permit to place a residence on a vacant lot, which was one of two adjacent lots she owned in trust. A zoning enforcement officer denied the application. Defendant, the Zoning Board of Appeals of the Town of Greenwich (Connecticut) (ZBA), denied the landowner's appeal as well as her alternative application for a variance of the minimum lot size requirement for the lot at issue. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lots were rezoned in 1969 to allow a single-family residence per 20,000-square-foot lot. Each lot had insufficient footage. The second lot had a residence. The ZBA denied the appeal based on the permit application being incomplete and denied the variance for failure to show, inter alia, undue hardship. The landowner argued on appeal that the nonconforming use was allowed and that denial of the variance was unsupported by the record and was an unconstitutional taking. The superior court held that the incompleteness of the permit application failed as the basis for denying the appeal, but that the denial was still proper. The nonconforming use was not allowed because, under Town of Greenwich, Conn., Bldg. Zone Regs. &sect; 6-9, the two lots merged in 1969 when they were rezoned while under common ownership and while having sufficient combined footage to meet the size requirements. Next, the record supported denial of the variance, as the landowner's claims of disappointment in the use of the property and economic loss or potential financial gain did not show undue hardship. Finally, the landowner failed to meet the finality requirement for judicial review of her takings claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mobile home seller brought a claim alleging that defendants discriminated in the terms and conditions of the sale of the mobile home based on the familial status of the prospective buyer by refusing to approve the sale. Defendants moved to implead a party, or, in the alternative, join an interested party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought to include a town as a party, and argued that the town may have been liable for all or part of the mobile home seller's claim based on the town's zoning regulations and building code. The court held that since Connecticut did not recognize the concept of contribution among joint tortfeasors, one tortfeasor generally was not allowed to implead another. The third-party complaint needed to allege that the third-party defendant was liable to the third-party plaintiff, not to the original plaintiff. The fact that the town may have been liable did not provide a reason to permit the town to be impleaded. Defendants also argued that the town was a necessary party. The court held that a party was required to be joined if in its absence complete relief could not have been accorded among those already parties. When persons were aware of an action but chose not to claim an interest by failing to join in the action, they were not considered necessary parties. The court presumed that the town was aware of the litigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner filed a lawsuit to void a municipal ordinance regulated by defendant town's health department. The issue was whether the portion of Fairfield, Conn., Pub. Health Code &sect; 3.3 which required landlords to file an application for a certificate of rental occupancy (CRO) containing certain tenant information was void or in violation of the federal and/or state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There were two pages to the CRO application form. The property owner would not provide the information requested on the second page, including the tenant's name, vehicle license plate number, and other personal information. Each tenant was also required to sign a certification clause. The health department had threatened the property owner with monetary fines and prison. The court held that no state statute authorized the health department to imprison the property owner for six months or to imprison the property owner for each day the code was in violation. The enactment of Fairfield, Conn., Pub. Health Code &sect; 3.3 was illegal in that it exceeded the power granted to it by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19a-207 when it required tenants' information as to tenants' names, ages, relationships, and automobile information. The information did not relate to sanitary or health issues. The exhaustion doctrine did not apply since the property owner was attacking the validity and constitutionality of the regulation itself. The court further found that the town, through its department of health, had prepared an illegal form in page two of the CRO application form.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and legal guardian of a mentally impaired adult who was in the custody of the Connecticut Department of Mental Retardation filed an action, pro se, against the Executive Director of the Connecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy, alleging that her son had been denied the right to attend religious services and to celebrate his birthday and certain holidays, that he had not received proper care or medical treatment, and that the director had conducted meetings and hearings concerning her son without notifying her that those meetings or hearings would be held. The mother claimed that these actions violated her rights and her son's rights and she sought punitive damages. The superior court held that because the mother's complaint did not allege that the director exercised authority conferred upon him by a statute that was unconstitutional or that he acted in excess of the authority granted him, the court could not conclude that the action was not barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity or that the director was not protected by the personal immunity which he was afforded under Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State of Connecticut moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction the tort claim of plaintiff dentist, seeking to recover damages caused by the state's negligent failure to inform him of a disease carried by a ward of the state whom he had treated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Some years after the dentist treated a ward of the state, he discovered that he had contracted hepatitis B from him, and had passed it on to other patients. The dentist was financially ruined by the resulting license suspension and lawsuits by infected patients. He sued the state, alleging that it knew or should have known of the condition and failed to warn him. Since he had not timely filed his claim with the Connecticut claims commissioner within the statutory time limit, believing that he had identified the patient as the source of infection too late, he sought relief from the limitations period through private legislation, as permitted by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-148(b) in situations implicating a public purpose. The court held that the special law in question did not violate Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1's prohibition against special emoluments because it served a public purpose of assuring that health care providers would not have to fear treating wards of the state. Once he had filed, the dentist did not have to file a new claim with the commissioner after a constitutionally valid special law was passed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was working as a taxicab driver when he picked up a passenger, who subsequently attempted to rob him and stabbed him in the neck. Defendant shot and killed the assailant. The court held that a person who had a proprietary or controlling interest in the place of business in question had an interest in protecting that property. When such a person was within his place of business, he was not in the public sphere. Therefore, his interest in protecting his property outweighed the public interest in gun control. In addition, any statutory ambiguity had to be construed in favor of defendant. Thus, a taxicab could be a place of business for purposes of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-35(a). Defendant was not an employee of the cab company. To the contrary, he was an independent contractor who had a proprietary interest in the taxicab. Therefore, defendant's taxicab was his place of business for purposes of &sect; 29-35(a). However, it was premature to grant defendant's motion to dismiss, as a material question of fact remained as to whether defendant carried the handgun solely inside his taxicab within the relevant time frame.</SPAN></P>

Their fourth revised complaint alleged, in nine counts, several causes of action and a request for injunctive relief. The town moved to strike all nine counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents contended the town knew of the odors, was warned by the state to correct the situation (which was in violation of Conn.

Stat. &sect; 22a-184 breach of statutory duty. The residents adequately pled causes of action for: (1) private nuisance, as such an action could lie against a town and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-557n(b)(8) specifically provided for liability for a town's failure to detect or prevent environmental pollution; (2) negligence, as duty, breach of duty, causation, and injury were pled and governmental immunity was not a defense; (3) recklessness, as the residents pled specific additional factual allegations of reckless and wanton misconduct; (4) trespass, as they pled the requisite elements and governmental immunity was not a defense; (5) intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, as they pled specific facts to support both causes; (6) injunction, as they pled they had no adequate legal remedy; and (7) unconstitutional taking, as they pled a trespass that was a taking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion with respect to the count alleging breach of statutory duty prohibiting polluting the air since that statute did not afford the residents a private cause of action but rather explicitly stated that enforcement of that statute was a function of the state's attorney general, and denied the motion with respect to all the other counts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The innkeeper operated a licensed rooming house. The innkeeper was arrested after locking two persons out of a room and keeping the personal possessions. He alleged the police department had a 90-day policy which determined whether an occupant was a tenant or a transient. The innkeeper was asking the court to find that in every situation he was exempt from summary process and any arrest resulting from an investigation of a complaint of lockout was per se illegal. The court held there was an adequate remedy if the innkeeper prevailed which negated the need for an injunction. The circumstances of the transaction between the innkeeper and the occupant would determine whether the occupant was a transient. The innkeeper had not proved the constitutional violations alleged or that without the injunction he would suffer irreparable harm. The innkeeper failed to show there was a 90-day policy. The innkeeper was unlikely to prevail on the merits. Based on the evidence presented and an assessment of the credibility of the witnesses the court found that the innkeeper failed to meet the standard of proof as to the four part test for the issuance of an injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The application for the temporary injunction was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a &quot;friend&quot; and the probate court, jointly filed an application seeking to remove respondent parents as guardians of their minor child. On the same date, the probate court also filed an application for court-initiated removal of guardianship. Petitioners filed their applications in the Bristol Probate Court (Connecticut). The case was subsequently transferred to the superior court. The parents filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents argued that the applications were governed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-614 and that the motion to dismiss should be granted because neither petitioner had standing and the statute was unconstitutional. The superior court concluded that, pursuant to the plain language of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-614, the probate court did have standing to bring an application for removal of the parents as guardian of their minor child, but the &quot;friend&quot; did not. The statute did not expressly limit the probate court's power to initiate an application to cases that were already pending before it. In addition, the parents had not shown that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-614 was unconstitutional.  Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-614 was narrowly tailored because it required that the parents be given notice and a hearing and only permitted the probate court to grant such an application if it found by clear and convincing evidence that the parent had abandoned or consented to the abandonment of the child; the parent's conduct had jeopardized the physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being of the child; or the child had been found to be neglected or uncared for.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' motion to dismiss the joint application for removal of guardian as it pertained to the &quot;friend&quot; was granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petition filed by the commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families to terminate the parental rights of the respondent mother and the father, whose identity was unknown, was granted. The mother filed an application for a waiver of fees, costs, security and expenses of appeal pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. App. P. &sect; 63-6. The mother also sought appointment of counsel at state expense to prosecute her appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the mother's request, the Department argued that the mother's appeal was without merit, and therefore, the application should be denied. The mother argued that the termination of parental rights statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-112, was unconstitutional, and that the trial court based its termination of parental rights on insufficient evidence. The superior court held that the proposed appeal was without merit, and thus, the mother was not entitled to a waiver of fees, costs, security, and expenses. The superior court noted that the claimed constitutional issues did not provide a sufficient bases to justify the appeal. In addition, the superior court found that the alleged ground for the termination of parental rights, the failure to achieve rehabilitation, had been proven by clear and convincing evidence. Finally, the superior court noted that the evidence was more than sufficient to support a finding that termination of the mother's parental rights was in the child's best interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several robberies were committed in various local businesses in neighboring towns. From the pictures of the car taken from a surveillance tape, the police were able to determine the make, model, color, and range of model years of the car. The police departments from the adjoining towns of Vernon and Manchester worked together to solve these crimes. They formed an opinion that the robberies were being performed by one individual based on the clothing, physical description of the robber, the way the crime was committed, the description of the weapon, types of businesses targeted, and the vehicle used. A police officer on patrol saw a vehicle matching the description of the vehicle used in the robberies parked awkwardly outside of a gas station, and ultimately stopped and arrested defendant. In reviewing the motion to suppress, the trial court found that, based on the facts, it was clear that the police officer and the other members of the police department had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was the perpetrator of the robbery at the convenience store as well as the other robberies, and that he was about to commit another robbery until he saw the officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PZC proposed to amend the floor area ratios in certain zones. A notice of a hearing on the amendment was published in a newspaper twice, but under the second notice was a notice of change of location of the hearing. Three of the individual homeowners testified that they were affected by the amendment. The court found that these three individual homeowners met the test for classical aggrievement, as they showed specific personal and legal interests regarding the amendment and that the amendment decreased their property values. The other individual homeowners, however, provided no proof of aggrievement. To bring suit, an association needed to show that at least one of its members would have had standing to sue. However, the association failed to show this, and thus it had no standing. The notice procedures required that the time of a public hearing have been published at least twice, and were prerequisites to valid zoning actions. The changed location of the hearing was published only once. The failure of the PZC to publish proper notice according to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-3(a) was a jurisdictional defect and the amendment was null and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the administrative appeal and declared that the amendment of the regulations by the PZC was null and void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant transportation department denied plaintiff limousine corporation's application for certain permits to operate intrastate livery service on the ground that the corporation had not established the requisite &quot;public convenience and necessity,&quot; pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13b-103. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hearing officer denied the corporation's request for an additional 60 intrastate licenses and granted 5. The court held that because the corporation had obtained permits and sought to obtain additional ones under &sect; 13b-103 in the proceeding, it could not attack the statute's constitutionality. The inclusion of the &quot;public convenience and necessity&quot; standard in the language of the permit confirmed that the standard was a necessary (although not sufficient) condition of obtaining a permit. The hearing officer thus did not err in denying the corporation's application solely on the basis that it had not established public convenience and necessity. Further, the hearing officer properly examined the convenience and necessity of public consumers, not the private livery service. The hearing officer could reasonably have found that the public need for more intrastate livery service from the corporation was limited. Finally, the hearing officer quite logically concluded that the public had a need for five additional intrastate vehicles to meet the excess demand. Accordingly, the corporation's challenge to the hearing officer's conclusions could not prevail.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Defendant further contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague on its face in that it failed to set forth a standard of proof for the court to follow in determining whether he should be released or civilly committed and failed to set forth a burden of persuasion. The court concluded that the plain language of the statute did not provide the trier of fact with any standards or guidance for deciding whether defendant should be released or retained in custody. Further, the statute provided no standards or guidance as to how a court was to determine, if defendant was to be detained, as to which commissioner should be entrusted with the care of defendant. The statute was unconstitutionally vague in providing standards for the trial judge to use in selecting the choice or implementing the choice of remedy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After their property was demolished, plaintiff owners sued defendants, city, city official, and building official, alleging, inter alia, misconduct, trespass, and an illegal denial of the use of their property (count one); an unconstitutional demolition and inadequate notice (count four); and a due process violation under the Connecticut Constitution and trespass (count six). Defendants moved to dismiss counts one, four, and six.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the owners' house was allegedly damaged during a police search, the city notified the owners that the property was unsafe and would be demolished by the city within 30 days if the owners did not repair the damage or demolish the house. The notice informed the owners of their right to appeal. Instead of filing a Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-405 appeal within 10 days of the notice, the owners filed a civil suit months later. Defendants asserted that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims in the three counts because the owners failed to exhaust the statutory appeal remedy. Of the claims included in the various counts, the trial court found that the mandatory statutory appeal remedy applied to (1) the claims of count one that the demolition constituted misconduct, (2) all the claims of count four, and (3) the claim of count six that the demolition violated the due process provisions of the Connecticut Constitution. The other claims, such as trespass, were not subject to the statutory appeal remedy and did not have to be dismissed. None of the owners' factual allegations supported their claim that defendants were estopped from raising the exhaustion defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court (1) granted the motion to dismiss with respect to (a) the claim in count one that the demolition constituted misconduct, (b) all of count four, and (c) the claim in count six that the demolition violated the due process provisions of the Connecticut Constitution, and (2) denied the motion to dismiss as to the remaining claims in count one and count six.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being acquitted by reason of mental defect of sexual assault and unlawful restraint, defendant filed a motion to strike a report by the psychiatric review board (PRB) to which he had been committed for a period not to exceed six years. The report recommended continued commitment. Defendant also moved to dismiss the recommitment process. The State moved to recommit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In asserting his motions, defendant argued that the recommitment report prepared by the PRB should not be considered as evidence at the hearing. Further, he contended in his motion to dismiss that the entire recommitment process was unconstitutional. The hearing court found that he failed to convince the hearing court that his constitutional rights would have been violated if the proceeding was not treated as a civil commitment proceeding. To the contrary, the PRB effectively and convincingly argued that all of the attendant due process and equal protection rights appended to this class of acquittees. The hearing court found further that defendant was not entitled to the same panoply of rights provided in the civil commitment process. Moreover, in addressing the State's motion for recommitment, all the experts agreed that defendant had a chronic mental illness which was currently asymptomatic because he was taking his psychiatric medications in a supervised setting. His own expert agreed that the only way he would stay asymptomatic was if he continued to take his medications, and continued with therapy and regular psychiatric monitoring.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motions were denied. The State's motion was granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city approved a 90-acre development plan (MDP) and gave defendant development agency (NLDC) certain authority under Conn. Gen. Stat. chs. 130, 132, 135, inter alia, to take certain properties for public use, including plaintiff homeowners' homes in parcels 3 and 4A, by eminent domain.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed Connecticut's Redevelopment, Municipal Development, and Uniform Relocation Assistance Acts, respectively, Conn.

The tenant's poor housekeeping, damages to the premises, and her lifestyle did not excuse the landlords' discriminatory conduct in their housing practices. The landlords were to cease and desist from refusing to negotiate to rent, or from refusing to make timely repairs to the premises.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to escape in the first degree and was given a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison to run consecutive to other sentences he was serving. In an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, defendant alleged that his conviction was illegal because his plea was not entered knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. Respondent warden raised a special defense of procedural default to one of defendant's arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that (1) his counsel gave false assurances about the maximum sentence defendant would receive, and (2) and the prosecutor committed misconduct by requesting a maximum sentence at sentencing. The habeas court believed defense counsel's testimony as to the advice and negotiations that occurred and disbelieved defendant's testimony that his counsel advised him that he faced 10 years if went to trial and faced less than 10 years if he pleaded guilty. Defendant's argument overlooked that he risked a sentence much longer than 10 years if he went to trial because the State would have pursued a conspiracy to escape charge and a persistent felony offender count which defendant avoided by pleading guilty. The warden asserted that defendant's 2nd argument was not reviewable due to the failure to raise it at trial or on direct appeal. To be reviewable, defendant had to show, inter alia, prejudice from the alleged prosecutorial misconduct. Defendant failed to show any misconduct or prejudice, as defendant and the State had no agreement regarding the sentence and defendant had acknowledged at the plea hearing that the State could argue for the maximum penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners claimed that the gross inadequacy of the compensation of $ 6,100 was conceded by the State's appraiser in her valuation of $ 15,100, and this was reached by her arbitrary discount of 50% for the slope rights. No consideration was given to loss of frontage, loss of access, nor limitation or impairment of access in her appraisal. The owners also claimed that the State has not adequately reserved any right of way for the use and benefit of the subject property along a discontinued road. The failure to include the reservation of such a right in fact left the property landlocked, with no marketable means of ingress or egress. The State maintained that the premise of the owner's appraisal was incorrect and misleading. The trial court found that the portions of two roads formerly abutting the subject property on the north and east, respectively, had been discontinued by their relocation away from the owners' borders. Further, after viewing the site of the subject property, and after giving due consideration to the opinions of expert witnesses and to a knowledge of the elements that establish value, the court adjusted the amount of damages the owners were entitled to receive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was entered for the owners in the amount of $ 111,000.</SPAN></P>

The superior court found that the bidders made no claim that there was a statutory waiver, failed to allege a substantial violation of their constitutional rights, and failed to allege a substantial claim that a state official had violated the bidders' rights by acting in excess of the official's statutory authority. Defendants also claimed that the bidders lacked standing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner sued, inter alia, defendant town because it was unable to develop its property due to a change in the 100-year flood elevation. The town sought summary judgment as to three counts of the complaint that alleged absolute private nuisance and violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the owners bought its building, the flood insurance rate map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) indicated that the 100-year flood elevation near the property was 180 feet. Later, FEMA re-defined the 100-year flood elevation as 188.7 feet. As the first floor of the building was below this elevation, federal and local regulations forbade any residential development of the building. Count four of the owner's complaint alleged that a bridge the town built was a nuisance, as it caused the 100-year flood elevation to increase near the property. As the owner's expert testified that the bridge had little or no impact on the 100-year flood elevation, the owner could not show the bridge was a proximate cause of any injury. Count six alleged, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, intentional or reckless misrepresentations by the town that deprived the owner of property without due process of law. The owner did not allege any policy or custom of the town that deprived it of a constitutional right; the town simply was enforcing federal law. However, Count seven sufficiently alleged a taking of property without just compensation under &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment was denied as to count seven, alleging an unconstitutional taking of property under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Summary judgment was granted as to count four, alleging absolute private nuisance, and count six, alleging intentional or reckless misrepresentations by the town under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence pursuant to his conviction on guilty plea of sexual assault included a probation component. The order of probation required him to submit to the supervision of probation officers and to undergo sex offender treatment. The treatment program included periodic polygraph testing. Although he had previously been tested while on parole, defendant refused to sign a waiver that was a condition of the test being performed, the test was not performed, and an information charging defendant with probation violation was issued. The court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-30(b) authorized the probation department to add conditions of probation that were within the power of the sentencing court to impose if they were not inconsistent with other conditions. There was nothing illegal about using polygraphs, so long as their results were not introduced in court, and their use reasonably related to the purpose of monitoring defendant's behavior. As a person already convicted of the crime for which probation was imposed, defendant had no self-incrimination privilege. Other determinations would have to wait the actual revocation hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant, the Town of Guilford Planning and Zoning Commission, Connecticut, adopted several amendments to the town's zoning regulations and zoning map, including creating a shopping center zone district and establishing special permit criteria for certain expansions, plaintiffs, landowners, and others, challenged the commission's decision through an administrative appeal, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that the commission acted beyond its authority in enacting the amendments and that the special permit criteria were overly broad and vague. The commission responded that plaintiffs lacked standing to assert their vagueness and overbreadth claims, that the commission acted within its authority, and that the special permit criteria were not overly vague or broad. The superior court held that 6 of the 7 landowners established statutory aggrievement as to the amendments regarding the shopping center zone district by proof that their property was within 100 feet of that district. However, aggrievement was not shown by any plaintiffs as to the other amendments. Furthermore, since plaintiffs combined a general attack on the amendments based on constitutional vagueness grounds with nonconstitutional arguments for attacking the amendments' validity, it served judicial economy to require the constitutional claims to be presented to the court in the same action as the other claims. Since a declaratory judgment action, unlike the statutory appeal, could accommodate both types of claims, a declaratory judgment action was the proper vehicle for the claims.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the language of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-100d was clear and unequivocal. That statute eliminated good time credit for inmates who committed crimes subsequent to the effective date of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-100d, October 1, 1994.  Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-100d was controlling over all prior statutes, including Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-7a.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found the property owners received compensation for their properties through the condemnation process. The owners chose not to contest these amounts of compensation by arguing the value of their properties or the devaluation of their properties during the condemnation process. There was no inverse condemnation claim where the properties have been taken by eminent domain.  Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 48-17b. An inverse condemnation proceeding was a remedy to be used only when the government had not exercised its right to eminent domain. The owners admitted that defendants, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-126, properly filed certificates of compensation. There was nothing to support the owners' claims that the taking of their properties by defendants was not justified or that they were not justly compensated. There was no claim that defendants discriminated against the owners due to their ethnicity or that a racial intent was present.

The owner alleged that defendants violated her due process rights by assessing her a second time without notice or a public hearing. Defendants asserted that the owner failed to exhaust all administrative remedies.

The company did not meet its burden of showing that any error by the department hearing officer affected its substantial rights. The company failed to show the hearing officer actually relied on allegedly inaccurate information or that the company was harmed by any such reliance. The company claimed the department made an improper ex parte communication with the commissioner to request the orders at issue were not briefed adequately.

A doctor stated that it was very difficult to determine when this infection started. The prisoner was treated appropriately for the latent infection and was to be continually monitored throughout his incarceration. The doctor testified that although the prisoner would continue to test positive in any skin test, he had acquired a limited immunity to the disease and should remain free of any further symptoms. The facility in which the prisoner was confined was determined to be not detrimental to his health and adequate medical attention was being provided for him. The prisoner did not submit evidence to support his claim that his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced by the warden's application of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-39a.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's lot was part of a subdivision. Notes on the subdivision map reflected that a parcel was to be transferred such that the landowner's lot was to consist of two specific parcels. The transfer did not take place. The board argued that the transfer of the parcel was a condition of the subdivision approval and that the lot was not a valid building lot since it did not meet minimum width dimensions. The court held that on appeal, the record before the board was reviewed to determine if it acted fairly or with proper motives or upon valid reasons. The court needed to determine if the record contained substantial evidence from which the finding could be inferred. The court found that the board's decision to deny the landowner's appeal was not supported by substantial evidence, as the record was devoid of any evidence to support a finding that the lot was not a buildable lot. Further, the record did not support a finding that the notes written on the subdivision map regarding the exchanges of the parcels of property were mandatory. The record revealed that the lot was part of an approved subdivision and thus the lot was protected as a nonconforming lot.</SPAN></P>

The daughter applied for a prejudgment remedy to secure the sum of $ 1.2 million.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adoptive father objected to the prejudgment remedy requested, arguing that the case was governed by New York law, barred by the statutes of limitations, and that the statute of repose of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-577d was unconstitutional given the health conditions which compromised his ability to defend himself. The court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-278d(a) required the court to determine if there was probable cause that a judgment would be rendered in the amount of the prejudgment remedy sought or greater. Both the medical records and the photographs supported the claims and the court found probable cause that judgment would be rendered in the amount of the prejudgment remedy requested. The general rule was that social and economic legislation generally violated the Equal Protection Clause only if the classification drawn by the statute was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest. There was a compelling state interest involved and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-577(d) was as narrowly drawn as possible to protect the compelling state interest which it was meant to advance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former member sued defendants, society and agents, for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) and negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) for their alleged failure to respond appropriately or adequately to her requests for help in escaping abuse from her husband. The society, which was religious in nature, and the agents, who were elders in the society, moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former member alleged that society members were invited to approach elders whenever they needed help, and that, when she did so, they failed to help her and advised her to remain in the abusive relationship. In seeking summary judgment, defendants asserted that the IIED claim failed because their conduct was not extreme or outrageous, the NIED claim failed because they provided only spiritual counseling and owed the former member no duty, and U.S. Const. amend. I barred both claims due to the need to avoid &quot;excessive entanglement&quot; of church and state. The trial court held that, although defendants' counseling suggestions may have been ill advised and insensitive, they did not meet the threshold of extreme outrageous conduct required for the IIED claim. Although the court was not able to say as a matter of law that defendants did not owe the former member a duty of reasonable care in their counseling, the NIED claim nevertheless failed because a judicial review of it would have required evaluating the society's religious tenets and the discharge of defendants' pastoral responsibilities, which would have led to an unconstitutional excessive entanglement with religion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagee was the mortgagee of two properties that were destroyed by fire. The mortgagee owned fire insurance policies insuring its interest in the properties, and it recovered the proceeds under the policy. The bank owned the real property tax lien assessed against the properties. The city owned the water liens assessed against one of the properties. The city owned a demolition lien on one of the properties. The court found that the city could recover its demolition expenses against the insurance proceeds. The city gave the mortgagee timely constructive notice of its interest in the insurance proceeds, and the mortgagee's attack on the validity of the demolition lien was without merit. The court found that the bank's tax liens were superior to and took priority over the mortgagee's insurance proceeds. Under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-73a, the city's water use lien did not have priority over the mortgagee's insurance policy. Under &sect; 49-73a, the municipal tax lien had priority over the mortgagee's insurance proceeds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Court finds cause to set aside the paternity acknowledgment. Court finds paternity is at issue and grants defendant's motion for genetic testing.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged father moved for genetic testing in a pending action instituted by plaintiff commissioner of social services which was petitioning for the support of a minor child on behalf of the plaintiff mother. The mother objected, claiming the court had no authority to rule on the motion prior to granting a motion to open and set aside the judgment of paternity. No motion to open and set aside was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged father argued there was no judgment and that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-172(a)(1), (3) violated the separation of powers and was unconstitutional. He also argued that &sect; 46b-172(a)(3) unlawfully granted judicial powers to the executive branch. The alleged father had an IQ of 67 and was willing to sign anything. The court held &sect; 46b-172(a)(1) allowed the legislature to assume a judicial power in violation of Conn. Const. amend. art. II. The congressional mandate did not save &sect; 46b-172(a)(1) from its constitutional infirmity. The custodial duties granted to the public health department were not exclusive functions of the judiciary, nor was there any basis for finding a significant interference with the administration of justice because such documents were filed with the department. The court's revised version of &sect; 46b-172 set forth a viable process for obtaining an acknowledgment of paternity and seeking support orders in court. The alleged father did not have the mental capability to understand his rights, and therefore his waiver of rights to counsel, genetic testing, and a trial, pursuant to the oral and written notice, was not valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found cause to set aside the paternity acknowledgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DHSS condemned all dwelling units at the property owners' premises as unfit for human habitation as a result of damage caused by two fires. As a result, the DSS provided relocation assistance payments to numerous tenants and also made a demand upon the property owners for reimbursement. The DHSS and/or DSS filed a series of liens against the premises and claimed a right of reimbursement from the property owners for all relocation assistance payments made to the tenants of the premises. The property owners filed an appeal with the DECD. By final decision the commissioner, on behalf of the DECD, dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The property owners alleged, inter alia, that the final decision of the DECD violated state and federal constitutional principles. The court held that the motion to strike could not be granted on the ground that comity precluded the pursuit of mirror image claims under the constitutions of Connecticut and the United States, in the absence of allegations that Connecticut's constitutional provisions were inadequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state defendants' motion was denied. The court also held that if the property owners prevailed in their appeal, the court could, in its discretion, award reasonable fees to the property owners if the court determined that the state defendants acted without any substantial justification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with, inter alia, felony murder and larceny in the second and third degrees, in connection with an incident that culminated in the shooting death of a police officer, making defendant eligible for the death penalty. Defendant moved to dismiss the felony and pecuniary gain aggravants and to bar the use of a predicate and previous felony committed before defendant was 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties stipulated to, but did not admit, certain facts for motion purposes. The court had jurisdiction under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-56. Resolution of the issues was in the best interests of judicial economy, case handling, and human factors. Defendant had the burden of proof. The Ex Post Facto Clause barred use of murder of a police officer as an aggravant, since even though it was a capital felony under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54(b)(1) it was not made an aggravant under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-46a(i) until after the case was instituted. The court used a summary judgment standard. The court construed &sect; 53a-46a(i) to determine that the same felony (meaning having the same classification) aggravant was allowed. The Blockburger double jeopardy analysis was not used. The pecuniary gain aggravant did not apply since defendant was not hired to kill the officer. The State was not barred from using the before-age-18 same felony larceny offense although defendant had pled guilty, claimed &sect; 53a-46a(i) was void for vagueness, and could not have been sentenced to death for a crime before age 18. A court was not required to inform a defendant of every consequence of a guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion with respect to the same felony aggravator and use of the same felony committed prior to age 18 as a predicate felony, and granted the motion with respect to the pecuniary gain aggravator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An information charged defendant with the murder of a female victim on or about October 30-31, 1975, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54a. Defendant moved to dismiss the information claiming that the statute of limitations in effect at the time of the offense, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-193 (Rev. to 1975), barred his prosecution after five years from the date of the offense. The prosecution of defendant commenced after this period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties did not disagree that &sect; 54-193 (Rev. to 1975) was the statute of limitations that applied to the case. However, they differed over its meaning as applied to defendant. The parties disputed the correct interpretation of a series of Connecticut Supreme Court decisions that bore on the issue of whether the prosecution of defendant was time-barred. Those case were State v. Paradise, State v. Ellis, and State v. Golino. The court concluded that &sect; 54-193 did not bar prosecution even though murder was not a capital offense at the time under the United States Supreme Court's Furman decision and the Connecticut Supreme Court's State v. Allion decision. The court reasoned the statute of limitations was to be interpreted using a broader policy goal related to the seriousness of the offense that historically had been linked to the prescribed punishment for the class of offense, whether or not the punishment could be legally imposed. The legislature used the phrase &quot;punishable by death&quot; as a shorthand reference to a category of crimes which, because of their atrocious nature, would always be amenable to prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner's habeas corpus petition against respondent prison warden claimed that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-125a(b), as amended by 1995 Conn. Acts 255, &sect; 1, was unconstitutional as ex post facto. The prisoner sought to be considered eligible for parole after serving 50 percent of his sentences imposed for crimes committed on November 17, 1994, as set forth in a mittimus, instead of the &sect; 54-125a(b) required 85 percent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that the mittimus stated that the prisoner's original dates of offense were in 1994, prior to the effective date of &sect; 1 (for offenses occurring before July 1, 1996). The court found that &sect; 54-125a(b), as amended by &sect; 1, as applied to the prisoner was a violation of the U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 Ex Post Facto Clause. Section 1 was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt as applied to the prisoner, as to his sentences imposed on November 7, 1997, for crimes committed in 1994. The prisoner's sentence was to be calculated for the purpose of parole eligibility under the law in effect in 1994. The court also gave the prisoner full credit for all 1,085 pre-sentence jail days, restoring 364 days that the trial court ordered to be credited in the mittimus but were not so restored.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the prisoner's writ of habeas corpus, ordered the warden to recalculate the prisoner's parole eligibility date in accordance with the statute as it existed at the time the offenses occurred, with respect to each sentence, and ordered the board of parole not to restrict itself to a mandatory minimum service of 85 percent of the prisoner's sentences as provided by the statute in determining his eligibility for parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the prosecution's decision to proceed with the death penalty hearing was an abuse of prosecutorial discretion because that decision was based on the race of the victims. The court advised that in order for defendant to prevail on his motion, he was required to show unconstitutional discrimination in the Fourteenth Amendment context, or he must show irrationality, arbitrariness, and capriciousness under Eighth Amendment analysis. The court advised that recognition by a prosecutor that the victims of a capital felony were from a minority group and the individual charged with capital felony for the murder of those victims was white and that those facts would rebut previous claims of racial unfairness in the imposition of the death penalty was not purposeful racial discrimination. In addition, the court noted the evidence did not exist to show any discriminatory intent. Neither were the prosecution's decisions irrational, arbitrary, or capricious. Accordingly, the court concluded defendant's claims, even if uncontradicted, were not sufficient to bar the death penalty phase of the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owners owned properties containing inland wetlands. Defendants included Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Commission of the Town of New Milford (Connecticut), which, acting under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-42a, had amended its regulations based upon advice from the Department of Environmental Protection. The owners appealed the amendments pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-43.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court's decision was withheld until, and based upon, the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision in the Queach Corporation v. Inland Wetlands Commission of Branford, which involved similar issues. The court first found that the owners were statutorily aggrieved under &sect; 22a-43, based upon a analogous analysis used for Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(a)(1), since they owned land within a 90-foot radius of wetlands. The court then determined that, since the owners had not filed an application with the commission and the regulations had not yet been applied, it would address the merits of the appeal but limit its review to the facial validity of the regulations. The court then determined that the regulations were facially valid under &sect; 22a-42a. The owners' concerns affecting their use of their land, inter alia, involved regulation (1) of groundwater and groundwater levels, or wells, (2) in excess of the defined area, (3) in excess of defined activities, (4) establishing a 100-foot buffer zone, and (5) improperly requiring submission of alternatives where there was no impact of an activity on wetlands and watercourses. The regulations effectively mirrored the language of &sect; 22a-42a.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sheriffs brought a declaratory judgment action against defendants, executor, comptroller and attorney general, seeking a declaration that the estate was entitled to indemnification. The sheriffs also sought a writ of mandamus ordering the comptroller to settle the judgment against the estate. The executor filed a cross claim for indemnification. The attorney general and the comptroller filed motions to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued the sheriffs lacked standing, sovereign immunity barred their claims, and they failed to pursue remedies under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-141 et seq. Defendants also argued the executor's cross claim was barred by sovereign immunity as well as failure to pursue remedies under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-141 et seq. The superior court found the sheriffs failed to cite a case or point to legislative history supporting a conclusion that their interests were protected or contemplated under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-141d(a). Thus, they failed to establish their interests were within the zone of interests or defendants violated a duty owed to them. The court also found the allegations in the complaint fell short of those required under the exception to sovereign immunity. Finally, the court held that because indemnification was available to the estate if the deceased was acting in the discharge of his duties or within the scope of his employment, or where the act or omission was not wanton, reckless or malicious, and the deceased's actions did not fall within these parameters, the indemnity claims did not fall under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-141d(a) and were barred by sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

Most of his claims had already been rejected by the state's high court, but the instant court considered, in particular, his argument that an amendment to the statute that permitted imposition of a death sentence in appropriate cases despite a finding of mitigating factors improperly prevented the factfinder from considering factors in mitigation and that the process did not meet the requirement for determination of sentence by a single human agency. The court held that the statute clearly still required the factfinder to consider mitigating factors; they could simply be outweighed by sufficient aggravating factors. The statute also required factfinders to take individual responsibility for grave decisions.</SPAN></P>

The organization did not have a specific, personal, and legal interest in the rights provided for in statutes exempted from the Enabling Act so as to give it standing. There was no substantive criteria imbedded into the statutes exempted from the Enabling Act and the organization's claim of deprivation of procedural rights under the exempted statutes did not give rise to a property right. Accordingly the organization lacked standing to bring the claim. The Enabling Act set forth legislative findings as to the public benefit to be derived from the Adriaen's Landing project. The findings clearly established a public purpose for the Enabling Act.

They also asserted misconduct by the opposing attorneys in issuing subpoenas and requesting costs. The court held the injured parties failed to pursue their cause of action with due diligence and therefore, their complaint was dismissed in its entirety against all the defendants. Further, their causes of action against the attorneys were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Their claims against one judge were barred due to the doctrine of judicial immunity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a habeas corpus petition in a Connecticut trial court after being incarcerated for almost 11 years. The inmate sought consideration for parole eligibility after serving 50 percent of his sentences, rather than the 85 percent mandated by a subsequent amendment to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-125a(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed the act that amended Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-125a(b) was an ex post facto law and, therefore, unconstitutional. The relief he sought was that he be considered eligible for parole after serving 50 percent of his sentence, rather than having to wait until he had served 85 percent of his sentence. The trial court found that the amended statute, as applied to the inmate, was a violation of the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10. The amended act was a criminal and penal statute that applied to offenses occurring before its effective date, and operated to create a significant risk of increased punishment for those offenses. Although the trial court considered requiring prisoners to serve 85 percent of their sentence to be a laudable goal, State laws had to function within the bounds of the United States Constitution. The statute was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt as it applied to the inmate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's writ of habeas corpus was granted. The trial court ordered respondent warden to recalculate the inmate's parole eligibility date as it existed at the time the offenses occurred. Further, the parole board was ordered not to restrict itself to a mandatory minimum service of 85 percent of his sentences in determining his parole eligibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The change of zone impacted properties previously located in one-half acre zones and one-acre zones. All of the parcels subject to the re-zoning were in either a two-acre or one-acre zone. A substantial portion of the re-zoned area was located within an aquifer protection district (APD) established by the town. The APD was created for the purpose of protecting ground water quality and guaranteeing a supply of safe drinking water. The area within the APD required a single-family dwelling to be constructed on parcels of two acres or more. The court held that since all of the landowners were statutorily aggrieved, they had standing. However, they failed to show that the procedures employed by the zoning commission in adopting the zone changes did not comply with the demands of due process or violated concepts of natural justice. The conduct of the hearings was fair, and interested persons were not denied the right to be heard or the right to submit evidence to the commission. There was no effort to prevent the introduction of any evidence by the landowners. The record provided ample and abundant support for the two-acre zone within the APD.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, town and intervenor solid waste disposal site operators, appealed from a decision of respondent Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection granting permits to the town to operate a solid waste transfer station on land leased from the operators, subject to conditions that the operators have no involvement in the facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A local solid waste disposal operation had a history of noncompliance with Connecticut's environmental standards. Their application to build a new transfer facility had already been rejected by the state environmental protection agency, so the town applied for a permit to build such a facility on the former operators' land. The agency approved the permit, but attached many conditions that the town and the operators considered burdensome, aimed at precluding any involvement by the operators except as lessors. The court to which they appealed held that it lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of their appeal.  Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-166(3)(A) provided a right to appeal only from a final decision in a contested case, and that meant only proceedings in which a hearing was mandatory. In the instant case, the hearing had been discretionary, and an untimely filing of petitions demanding a hearing did not make it mandatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state retirement plan (plan) member sued defendants, individually and as plan officers, for a temporary injunction and for damages. The plan had paid 100 percent of his benefits to an alternate payee, a former spouse, pursuant to a Michigan court order not filed in Connecticut courts. Defendants moved to dismiss for sovereign immunity, lack of jurisdiction for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and mootness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that though the member's claim was not barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the member had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies through the state employees retirement commission. The court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his prospective claim. The member's monetary damage claim was not moot. The alternate payee did not meet the Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-70, -71, -72 requirements. The payee did not appear, did not file, and got execution before the requisite filing and proof of service of the filing. Defendants paid the payee, nevertheless, claiming they were required to under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. The court found defendants acted outside their statutory authority and were not protected by sovereign immunity so as to bar the member's suit. However, the member still had administrative review remedies to exhaust under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-155a. The member primarily sought injunctive relief, to require defendants to provide a remedy. Since the member sought injunctive relief, he could not avoid exhaustion, as he normally could, by alleging 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners acquired the property in question by fiduciary deed. The tax assessor's records indicated that a residential structure, the major portion of which was constructed in 1934, existed on the land at the time the property owners acquired it. In 1988, an office and warehouse was erected on the property. On June 28, 1990, a 0.78 acre lot which contained a residential structure was conveyed by plaintiffs to themselves as trustees. The effect of this conveyance was to divide the original parcel into two lots. In the year 2000, the property owners applied to the zoning commission for authority to subdivide the original parcel acquired in 1984 into three lots. The commission did not approve the application. Subsequently, the owners applied for a variance, which the board denied. The trial court found that the property owners were aggrieved, and had standing to prosecute the appeal. However, the appellate court found that the problem which the property owners presented did not arise out of the regulations, but out of the manner in which the property owners elected to divide the tract of land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the board was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 46b-231(n), the Connecticut Department of Social Services, which was the subrogee of the child support rights of petitioner mother in the case due to her status as an active temporary assistance to needy families (TANF) recipient, appealed the decision of the Family Support Magistrate in the Judicial District of Danbury at Danbury (Connecticut) which dismissed the support petition filed by the mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A hearing was held on the support petition which claimed the child was the recipient of TANF benefits and that the respondent father was legally responsible for the child's support because the child was allegedly the issue of the marriage of the parties. Neither party was in attendance at the hearing. In support of the mother's allegation, the State offered &quot;certified&quot; copies of the parties' marriage certificate and the birth certificate of the child. Neither social services nor support enforcement were the departments responsible for preparation and maintenance of marriage or birth certificates. The court held the magistrate erred in not admitting the birth certificate since it was certified. However, although the marriage certificate was considered &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence, it was a copy and no testimony was offered to prove the mother was married. Thus, the decision of the magistrate denying the offer of the marriage certificate in evidence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The magistrate's decision regarding the birth certificate was reversed. However, the decision regarding the marriage certificate was affirmed. The decision to dismiss without prejudice was affirmed as the birth certificate alone would not have been sufficient to enter an order of support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-63f provided that Connecticut offenders were not eligible for post-conviction bail if they had been convicted of offenses involving physical harm or threats of physical harm to others. After his conviction of assaulting a correctional officer, defendant sought bail pending appeal arguing that the law violated separation of powers principles by regulating a subject that fell exclusively within judicial control and significantly interfered with the orderly functioning of the inherent judicial role of a Connecticut trial court. The court held, to the contrary, that bail had always been a matter over which legislative and judicial authorities exercised joint control in Connecticut, and it did not interfere with the court's functioning. Therefore, defendant failed to sustain his heavy burden to show that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife fell in her home and injured her leg. When the emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and the fire departments arrived, they manually carried her from the spot where she fell to an ambulance.

The trial court held, first, that the EMTs and the fire departments were granted immunity under the Connecticut Good Samaritan Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-557b(b), for any acts which constituted ordinary negligence. Second, the governmental immunity defense was inapplicable to the fire departments, because the town exercised little or no control over them or the ambulance services. Third, since &sect; 52-557b(b) was applicable, a gross negligence claim could be made. Fourth, the EMTs and the fire departments, even if negligent in the manner in which they lifted the wife, did not have any realization or consciousness that they were thereby causing her, or running the risk of causing her, serious physical injury. Finally, emotional shock, compensation for which was the linchpin of a bystander emotional distress claim, did not foreseeably accrue to the husband at the time he saw the wife being carried.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed: (1) the negligence claims and the claims derivative of them; (2) all the claims under any theory based on bystander emotional distress; (3) all the claims based on willful and wanton conduct; and (4) all the claims based on willful and wanton negligence. The trial court did not dismiss the negligent supervision claims and the claims derivative of them, except for those based on bystander emotional distress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the version of the DUI statute on which his conviction was based, gave him an expectation that his exposure to repeat offender punishment would end after five years of good behavior. Defendant further asserted that this expectation or pseudo probation was a legally enforceable right that could not be changed by a statutory amendment. The court found that the application of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227a's subsequent offender provisions to defendant was not an ex post facto violation. The statute stiffened the penalties for the new conviction because of defendant's prior offense but did not impose addition punishment directly for the prior offense. Defendant's equal protection/due process claim was that a second offender DUI defendant faced a more severe penalty than persons convicted of manslaughter second degree with a motor vehicle, or assault second with a motor vehicle. The court noted defendant's claim was based on statute's containing lesser included offenses which was not the case here.</SPAN></P>

The employer had not contested the wages, but used them as a setoff for other unrelated monies allegedly owed to the company by the victim.

The affiant had not intentionally or recklessly misled the issuing judge. Scrivener's errors in the warrant did not necessarily invalidate it.

Further, the court finds that custody of the defendant, reasonably to assure his appearance at any future assignment of the case, is unnecessary.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary and sexual assault and sentenced to six years' confinement. The State moved that defendant be denied bail pending his appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that defendant should have been denied bail because he was convicted of crimes involving the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against his victim. The State relied on 2000 Conn. Acts 200(5), an amendment to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-63f. The superior court held that the amended statute was unconstitutional. The amendment violated the separation of powers doctrine by allowing the legislature to intrude upon the powers of the judiciary. The superior court noted that the statute, as amended, was in direct contravention of a Connecticut rule of criminal procedure which provided that the power to admit to bail after conviction was not a statutory but a common-law power, that bail was a matter of absolute discretion, and that the power to admit to bail was inherent in the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In September 2000, the firefighters and the city entered into binding arbitration pursuant to the Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA), Conn.

The firefighters sought to preclude the board from also sitting as an arbitrator in the process. The trial court found that because the firefighters failed to demonstrate that they would suffer irreparable injury, and the likelihood of success on the merits, the court declined to grant the firefighters' application. The trial court also concluded that the firefighters had an adequate remedy at law. Finally, because testimony indicated that there were contingency funds available to pay for any increase in wages resulting from arbitration, the firefighters could not prevail on their claim that the board predetermined the question of wage increases for their membership.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that plaintiffs had established that defendants had not done what they were required to do under the consent order. Specifically, defendants failed to take necessary steps toward the closure and capping of a water impoundment, failed to submit an approval plan for the stabilization of a dike, and failed to remediate a wetland on the site. Defendants operated solid waste disposal areas, a volume reduction plant, and a transfer station on their parcels of land without permits from the commissioner. The violation of the consent order was also a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22a-208a(b), 22a-208c. The activities on certain parcels also violation water pollution laws.  Conn. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their motion for summary judgment, defendants argued that the doctrine of sovereign immunity precluded the prison employee from maintaining a cause of action against them. The employee could not pierce the defendants' sovereign immunity. There was no allegation that the defendants' alleged misconduct exceeded their statutory authority or that an applicable statute was unconstitutional. Further, even if the employee had specifically alleged that defendants exceeded their statutory authority, the acts and omissions complained of, even if true, were not in the nature of the actions found to be sufficient to avoid sovereign immunity. Defendants' conduct, assuming it resulted in the employee's injuries, was neither illegal, in violation of public policy, nor sufficiently egregious as to warrant a finding that they acted in excess of their statutory authority. Accordingly, the court concluded that sovereign immunity precluded the employee from maintaining his action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff health club member, both individually and as the representative for a class of persons similarly situated, filed an action against defendant health clubs. One club was no longer a defendant, and one remained. The remaining club moved to dismiss the action for mootness and lack of jurisdiction. The member moved for summary judgment and for class certification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The member sought punitive damages and injunctive relief which were available under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110a et seq. The club argued that the member's claims were moot, due to an offer of settlement the member rejected. The club's offer of settlement did not include injunctive relief or punitive damages.  Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-222(b) made any violation of the Health Club Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-216 et seq., a per se violation of CUTPA. Dismissal of the action would have deprived the member of access to CUTPA's remedies. If the member was precluded from seeking additional relief under CUTPA, &sect; 21-222(b) would have been rendered meaningless. While the member had no absolute right to either CUTPA punitive damages or injunctive relief, she had the right to have a court decide whether such relief was warranted. Therefore, on the basis that the settlement offer provided only partial relief, it did not extinguish the member's claims. Even if the member's individual claims were moot, her claims were capable of repetition yet evading review, and as such brought her under the mantle of the class action mootness exception doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A sheriff's department employee alleged that after he reported misconduct within the department, the sheriff and certain officials retaliated against him, committing acts that caused him to sue them in their official capacities.

Defamation and false arrest were torts for which sheriffs and deputies were specifically required to carry liability insurance under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 6-30a (1999), indicating the legislative understanding that the State might be held liable for such torts. The claim of civil conspiracy was not barred by sovereign immunity because it arose out of alleged acts in excess of the officials' performance of their duties, and the civil rights claim was not barred because it related to the false arrest claim. The claims in question were specifically exempted from the exhaustion of remedies otherwise required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-142.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a prisoner, sued defendants, correctional officials, in their official capacities for injunctive relief. The complaint was amended to add more defendants, correctional officials, in both their official and individual capacities, and to claim injunctive relief, and money and punitive damages. The original officials filed a motion to dismiss claiming, inter alia, sovereign immunity and immunity under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the allegations of a campaign to terrorize, intimidate, and threaten the prisoner were, if proven, sufficient to establish that the officials' conduct was egregious and in excess of their statutory authority. Thus, the intentional infliction of emotional distress claims were not barred by the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity. Similarly, the conduct complained of could lead a fact-finder to conclude that the officials acted wantonly, recklessly, or maliciously outside their official authority. Accordingly, the statutory immunity defense failed. Thus, the court had subject matter jurisdiction over the intentional infliction of emotional distress claims. The prisoner did not pursue his available remedies for money damages, and the court refused to recognize damages actions under the Connecticut and United States constitutions. Claims brought under the Connecticut penal statutes were improperly before the court. The prisoner lacked standing under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1997a(c) et seq. The newly added officials were not successfully added as parties by the amended complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original officials' motion to dismiss the prisoner's claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress was denied. The original officials' motion to dismiss the remainder of the prisoner's claims was granted. The officials purportedly added by virtue of the prisoner's amended complaint were dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As grounds for its petitions, the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF) alleged that: (1) neither the mother nor the father had an ongoing parent-child relationship with any of the children, and they had failed to rehabilitate themselves; and (2) the father had abandoned the children. The trial court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the mother's mental capacity resulting from her schizophrenia and mental retardation, and compounded by her continuing substance abuse, would prevent her from meeting the children's intellectual, emotional, or developmental needs, if they were placed in her care. Similarly, the trial court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the DCF had made reasonable efforts to locate the father, and that it had in fact located the father. However, after agreeing to meet with a social worker, the father moved to another state to look for work without leaving an address or telephone number at which he could be reached. Finally, neither Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-112(j)(1) nor Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff individual sued defendants sheriff and deputy for negligence, false arrest, and other claims. The sheriff filed the present motion to dismiss counts four and six of the revised amended complaint on the grounds that the claims against him were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The revised amended complaint stated the individual was served at his home in Woodbury, Connecticut by the deputy, the deputy sheriff of New Haven County, and that Conn.

Furthermore, the individual alleged the sheriff failed to supervise or train the deputy as to the statutory limits of his authority. The court found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 6-31 was clear and unambiguous, and the sheriff's actions were obviously outside the scope of his statutory authority. Therefore, the claims against the sheriff were not barred by common law sovereign immunity. As to whether the claims against the sheriff in his individual capacity were barred by &sect; 4-165, but for the exception in the statute for wanton, reckless, or malicious conduct, the sheriff would be statutorily immune for his conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, disabled student and his parents, moved to strike the special defenses asserted by defendants, transportation company, town, and board of education. The special defenses raised the issue of sovereign immunity in what otherwise would have been a routine liability claim for personal injuries sustained by the disabled student in a collision between his school bus and another vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Specifically, the town and the board of education (BOE) argued that the transportation of the disabled student to school involved duties for which the town and the BOE were responsible as agents of the state, and therefore the doctrine of sovereign immunity applied to bar the claims against them. The transportation company argued that the claims against it were also barred, because it was employed as an agent of the town and/or the BOE. The trial court found, inter alia, that the town, the BOE, and the transportation company were not entitled to sovereign immunity, because: (1) being a steward of state education policy did not make the BOE an alter ego of the state; (2) 2000 Conn. Acts 133, which applied retroactively, confirmed the initial legislative intent of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-557 and made clear that the defense of sovereign immunity was not available in a special education transportation case; (3) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-556 waived any claims of sovereign immunity raised in the special defenses; and (4) former Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-557 waived sovereign immunity in claims by school children transported to school in any vehicle used by a municipality for that purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual assault first degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-70(a)(2) and risk of injury to a minor in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21(2). Defendant moved to preclude the imposition of the mandatory minimum 10-year sentence prescribed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-70(b) based upon its violation of the equal protection doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was seven at the time of defendant's sexual assault.  Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-70(b) provided that sexual assault in the first degree required a mandatory minimum 2 year sentence, or, if the victim of the offense was under 10 years of age, a mandatory minimum 10 year sentence. The court held it was apparent that sexual assault first degree was a lesser included offense of aggravated sexual assault first degree. The effect of the statutory scheme was that the presence of an aggravating factor could result in a lesser mandatory minimum sentence. Someone who committed the same crime with a weapon would have received a lesser mandatory minimum. There were also indications of concern in the legislative history regarding the 10-year mandatory minimum provision since it was mentioned that its language was &quot;flawed.&quot; The statute violated defendant's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to preclude imposition of the mandatory minimum 10-year sentence was granted. Defendant was exposed to a maximum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years' imprisonment. Nothing in the court's opinion was to be construed as any indication of the sentence the court actually intended to impose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mother moved to dismiss the termination of parental rights petition of petitioner Connecticut Department of Children and Families, arguing that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-112(k), as interpreted by Connecticut case law, violated her due process rights under the United States and Connecticut Constitutions. Respondent father joined the mother in claiming that &sect; 17a-112(k) was unconstitutional, both on its face and as applied to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In her motion, the mother claimed that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-112(k) was void for vagueness because Connecticut case law held that the seven written findings the court had to make pursuant to &sect; 17a-112(k) did not have to be proven by clear and convincing evidence prior to the court's best interest determination. In response, the court held that &sect; 17a-112(k) was not void for vagueness, because there was significant guidance available as to the meaning of the phrase &quot;the best interest of the child.&quot; The court did not reach the issue of whether &sect; 17a-112(k) was unconstitutional as applied, because it concluded that the reasonableness of the efforts by the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF) toward reunification was not proven by clear and convincing evidence. The court came to this conclusion because both the mother and the father had sought to visit with the child at issue ever since her removal from their care, but they were prevented from doing so by the DCF. Thus, the DCF failed to meet its preliminary statutory burden of showing that it had made reasonable efforts to locate either the mother or the father and to reunify them with the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the termination petition, but ordered the child at issue to remain committed to the care and custody of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF) until May 2, 2002. The DCF was directed to provide reunification efforts, including visitation, between the child and the mother and the father, as well as the child's brother. Finally, the court ordered the filing of a permanency plan for the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was injured in an automobile accident. As a result of the injuries, the claimant recovered workers' compensation benefits and disability retirement benefits under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-192p. On appeal, the issue was whether the benefits the claimant received under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-192p should be categorized as disability benefits and thus set off from the policy limit, or as retirement benefits and not set off from the limit. The appellate court concluded that the majority of the arbitrators correctly determined that the benefits the claimant was eligible to receive under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-192p were retirement benefits and thus that the amount thereof should not be deducted from the amount of uninsured motorist benefits awarded to the claimant. The disability benefits available to the claimant were distinguishable from the benefits available to her under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-192p. The benefits the claimant was eligible to receive under Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated action, plaintiffs, sheriffs, deputy sheriffs, and others, filed complaints to quash the subpoenas issued by defendant attorney general during his ongoing investigation of the mismanagement of the sheriff's office. The attorney general claimed authority for the issuance of the subpoenas pursuant to the investigatory powers provided in the whistleblower statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-61dd.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriffs, the deputy sheriffs, and the others raised various claims as to why the subpoenas should be quashed. Based on the parties' arguments and a review of the relevant cases, the court found all their claims to be without merit. Specifically, the court held, first, that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-61dd did include the sheriffs and the deputy sheriffs based on the plain language of &sect; 4-61dd. Second, the sheriffs, the deputy sheriffs, and the others did not show how the investigations conducted by the attorney general pursuant to &sect; 4-61dd would result in criminal prosecutions without the protections of due process, and thus, the court did not address the facial unconstitutionality of &sect; 4-61dd. Third, the failure of &sect; 4-61dd to require a finding of probable cause before allowing the attorney general to subpoena the documents did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Fourth, the documents, since they were related to the official public status of the sheriffs and the deputy sheriffs, were not protected by the Fifth Amendment. Lastly, the power granted to the attorney general under &sect; 4-61dd was not an impermissible intrusion on the powers granted to other governmental departments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaints to quash the subpoenas were denied.

The hospital brought a third-party claim against the former deputy for his tortious behavior, and Conn. Gen.

The inmate asked to be considered eligible for parole after serving 50 percent of his sentences imposed for crimes committed in 1995.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute, as amended by the Act, required prisoners to serve 85 percent of their sentences. The inmate's 1995 offenses were committed prior to the effective date of the Act. In accordance with its rulings in three other cases, the trial court found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-125a(b), as amended by the Act, and as applied to the inmate, was a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The Act was a criminal and penal statute that applied to offenses occurring before its effective date, and operated to create a significant risk of increased punishment for those offenses. Despite the laudable goal of the Act, Connecticut law had to function within the bounds of the Constitution of the United States. The Act was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt as applied to the inmate as to his sentences imposed on various dates for crimes committed in 1995. The sentences for those crimes had to be calculated for the purpose of parole eligibility under the law in effect in 1995. Accordingly, the inmate was entitled to have his petition for a writ of habeas corpus granted and to have his parole eligibility date recalculated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the inmate's writ of habeas corpus; ordered the warden to recalculate the inmate's parole eligibility date in accordance with the applicable law as it existed at the time the offenses occurred, with respect to each sentence; and ordered the parole board not to restrict itself to a mandatory minimum service of 85 percent of the inmate's sentences in determining his eligibility for parole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firefighter had worked for the city for 14 years. He sustained severe injuries while in the course of his employment and subsequently applied for disability retirement. The retirement board voted unanimously to approve his disability request based on the medical records and in accordance with the fire department contract. Additionally, the retirement board set his pension at 55 percent of his base pay. The firefighter argued his award should have been higher due to the nature of his injuries and his years of service. The court held there was no rigid formula in the collective bargaining agreement or in the city charter for the retirement board to follow in determining the disability pension award. Since the award fell within the prescribed rates it was not arbitrary. Since the firefighter's disability was not the result of heart disease of hypertension, Conn. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization's claim of injury was the inadequacy of traffic analysis and in dealing with hazardous waste. First, the court held that the provision of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 32-664(g) of the Connecticut Enabling Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 32-650 et seq., requiring the court to render a decision within 21 days of the filing of the administrative record, was unconstitutional as a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers. As a result, it did not bar the court from issuing its decision after that deadline. Second, the organization did not meet the test of representational aggrievement. It failed to show that any of its members were likely to be specifically injured and failed to prove aggrievement on the basis of its claims relating to traffic or hazardous waste. Thus, the case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. However, the case was, alternatively, dismissed on the merits. The organization never asserted the claim of defective notice at the public hearing, and thus failed to establish that the commissioner's decision was based on an unlawful procedure.</SPAN></P>

The court reviewed her claims for various violations of the confidentiality provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. ch. 319, the child welfare statute, and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-51m, the whistleblower statute. It dismissed her claims under the child welfare statute for lack of jurisdiction, because no exception to sovereign immunity applied. Plaintiff did not fall into any statutory category of persons for whom immunity was waived, nor did she show that defendant acted outside its statutory authority so as to lose immunity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city planning commission amended Southbury, Conn., Subdivision Regs. &sect; 4.18.3, to change the amount of total area of a subdivision to be reserved for open space to 15 percent from 10 percent. The court consolidated plaintiff affected landowners' two suits, an administrative appeal under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8 and a declaratory judgment, which requested that the amendment be adjudicated invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found plaintiffs owned undeveloped lands affected by &sect; 4.18.3. For jurisdictional purposes the court determined that plaintiffs were classically and statutorily aggrieved for the administrative appeal and had standing for the declaratory judgment action. The court found that the affect of &sect; 4.18.3 to plaintiffs was more than a generalized fear of adversity and that there was evidence of a special adverse impact even though the lands had not yet been developed. The court discussed the elements of aggrievement and standing. The court upheld &sect; 4.18.3 since defendant's actions were in a legislative capacity, conclusions were reasonably supported by the record, and regulatory authority under the open space statute&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-25 was not violated. The court also determined that &sect; 4.18.3 did not violate the takings clauses of U.S. Const. amend. V, applied to the states by U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Ct. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Under the Aunt Hack test, police power was permissibly exercised if the developer's burden was attributed to his activity. Plaintiffs were not deprived of reasonable use of their properties until decision on a specific development proposal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff grandmother commenced a legal action against defendant daughter, seeking regular and reasonable visitation with her granddaughter. The daughter filed a motion to dismiss, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect;&sect; 10-30, 10-34. After the grandmother filed an amended complaint, a hearing was held on the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Problems between the grandmother and her daughter began soon after the birth of the daughter's child, for which the grandmother sought visitation rights in the action. The grandmother called the police on her daughter's then boyfriend, who later became her daughter's husband. The grandmother evicted her daughter and her boyfriend. The grandmother reported her daughter to the children and families department, which conducted an investigation and concluded the report was unsubstantiated. The grandmother refused to meet her daughter's husband. The court found there was not a sufficient basis to permit the grandmother to pursue the action for visitation. The daughter's family unit was intact, and the child was well-adjusted and happy. The court found that parents had the right to direct the upbringing and education of their children under their control. In the case, to permit the prosecution of the grandmother's motion would result in disruption of the existing family unit.</SPAN></P>

Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 9-4, that defendants erred in determining the value of benefit to the properties, and they were jointly aggrieved, the first count failed. The motion to strike as to count two was denied, because plaintiffs were permitted to state a claim for declaratory relief whether the governing statute provided it as an available remedy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' four children attended public school in a certain town. The town's board of education determined the children were not residents of the town and could not, therefore, receive a free education in that town. Plaintiffs' residential property was located both in the town in which their children attended school and in a neighboring town. The dwelling in which they resided was located on the portion of the property which was in the neighboring town.  Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-186, as amended, provided that when a family's dwelling was physically located in more than one town, the children were considered residents of each town, for purposes of being allowed to attend the town's schools, and the family could choose which town's schools they wished to attend. This statutory provision did not apply to plaintiffs, and their children were required to attend school in the town in which their dwelling was located. The fact that the children had been attending school in a different town did not estop that town's board of education from denying them permission to continue to attend the schools in its town.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed suit, and defendant school officials moved to dismiss several counts of the complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an application for visitation pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-59. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Additionally, defendant argued that &sect; 46b-59&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated defendant's U.S. Const. amend. XIV rights. The court declined to find Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-59&nbsp;unconstitutional either in general or as applied to the facts of the case. Further, the court noted that plaintiffs met the threshold requirement &sect; 46b-59 by alleging the death of the child's mother, thus fulfilling the prerequisite of disruption of the family unit. However, the court further required the specific pleading of and a preliminary hearing on facts which alleged unfitness or imminent harm to the child. At the hearing, the court advised the burden of proof would be on the applicant and the court would presume the parents' decision was in the child's best interest, unless there was probable cause to believe otherwise. Accordingly, the court indicated it would treat the motion to dismiss as a motion to strike, and granted the motion. The court further advised that plaintiffs could plead over, if possible, consistent with the court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court treated the motion to dismiss as a motion to strike because a motion to dismiss was not designed to test the legal sufficiency of a complaint in terms of whether it stated a cause of action. That should have been done, instead, by a motion to strike. In addition, the court granted the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant citizen requested the legal bills charged to plaintiff town under the Freedom of Information Act. Defendant, the Freedom of Information Commission (Commission) ordered plaintiffs to disclose the legal bills. The court affirmed the Commission's decision. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-146r did not overrule the Commission's decision. The statute did not apply retroactively, and did not change the law. There was substantial evidence on the record to support the Commission's conclusion that plaintiffs did not sustain their burdens of proof that the legal bills were exempt from mandatory disclosure under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-210(b). Section 1-210(b) did not violate the separation of powers doctrine, because the attorney-client privilege does not lie exclusively within judicial control, and the Commission's criteria regarding the privilege did not differ from that of the courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The Connecticut legislature did not overrule the Commission's decision in this case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that defendant was liable for the costs of investigating, containing, removing, monitoring, and mitigating the pollution caused by defendant's heating oil discharged. Defendant argued that plaintiff's delay in asserting the claim precluded relief based on statutes of limitations and the doctrine of laches. The court held that neither defense was applicable since plaintiff was acting on behalf of the state. In the absence of any clear intention of the legislature, either expressly or by necessary implication, to bind the state to the general statutes of limitations, plaintiff was not bound such statutes. Similarly, absent any indication that plaintiff intended to abandon the public right to environmental cleanup costs, the doctrine of laches was also not applicable to plaintiff as a representative of the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Motion to strike special defenses was granted. There was no express or implied indication that the statutes of limitations were intended to apply to the state, nor any abandonment of the public right to environmental cleanup costs to permit invocation of laches against the state. The defenses thus did not apply to plaintiff as a representative of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged defendant failed to revalue under Conn. Gen.

The court reviewed the appeal de novo by weighing the opinion of the appraisers, the claims of the parties, and the court's own general knowledge to decide the ultimate question of the true and actual value of the property. Defendant's last general reevaluation was in 1980. Property built since then related to 1980 valuations using the comparable sales approach. There was only one condominium complex in the city in 1980 with sale activity, so valuations of condominiums built after 1980, such as plaintiff's, were related to sales of the 1980 condominiums.

The city's mandate to revalue by 1998 was delayed by the state. Plaintiff did not submit independent valuations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court affirmed the commissioner's decision. First, Conn. Gen.

Second, the commissioner concluded that the single act of negligence was sufficient to find that plaintiff had violated CUTPA. The finding was not unfounded under the law, and the commissioner acted within his authority when he accepted the factual finding of the hearing officer, but reached a different legal conclusion. Also, the only professions excluded as a basis for CUTPA violations were medicine and law. Third, the fact that two agencies reached different legal conclusions regarding violations did not provide an automatic basis for overturning the commissioner's decision. Fourth, to overturn the commissioner's ruling, plaintiff had to do more than show that there were other plausible conclusions. Finally, the mere fact that the same agency prosecuted and adjudicated the complaint was not sufficient to render the hearing unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New Haven, Conn., Charter art. V, &sect; 10(a) provided that the mayor of the city was to be a legal voter in and resident of the city for at least five years immediately preceding election. Plaintiff wished to run for mayor, but had only been a voter in the city for two years. The court held the classification in question impinged upon two fundamental rights under the Connecticut Constitution, the right to travel within the state and the right of the people to choose their political leaders. It also impinged upon a third right, the right to seek elective office. The court held that where the classification impinged upon a fundamental right it must be struck down unless justified by a compelling state interest. The classification had to be drawn with precision, and tailored to serve legitimate objectives; should a second route exist which was less offensive to constitutionally protected rights, then that route had to be chosen. The court held the residency provision in question failed to meet this standard.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizens group sued the defendant public entities, seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctions related to the adoption of a municipal development plan. The public entities filed motions to dismiss the action, alleging lack of standing, lack of jurisdiction, improper venue and failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The citizens group filed objections to the motions to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens group alleged that the public entities' approval of the development plan violated state and federal constitutional provisions, that the actions of the public entities violated state statutes and city charters, and that the actions of the public entities violated the Environmental Policy Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-1 et seq., and the Environmental Protection Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-14 et seq. The court held that the venue objection had been waived due to a failure to raise it in a timely manner. However, the court found that a complaint under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-16 had to set forth factual allegations sufficient to support an inference of environmental damage in order to establish standing. The citizens group's complaint failed to do so and thus the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Finally, because the citizens group had failed to raise its environmental concerns in hearings before the defendant department of economic and community development, they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies; thus, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction on this basis as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lessors filed a complaint seeking payment of ground rents that defendants, condominium association and its board members, collected from unit owners who were assignees under a ground lease. Defendants asserted special defenses including the claim that the leases were unconscionable and thus, unenforceable. Defendants filed a counterclaim which included a claim for specific performance of the option to purchase the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that defendants were not entitled to specific performance of the purchase option. Construing the ambiguous language in the leases against plaintiffs, as the drafters, defendants did exercise the option to buy in a timely fashion. However, they failed to bring an action for specific performance within the time prescribed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47-33a(a), and the limitation period was not extended by the doctrine of equitable tolling. Thus, the action was time-barred. Additionally, the court found that the leases were enforceable as they were not unconscionable under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47-210. Defendants presented no evidence to establish that the amount due from each unit owner as a result of the obligations of the ground leases exceeded customary charges or costs. Specifically, defendants failed to prove presumptive unconscionability under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47-210(d)(1). Further, the court found that the testimony of the mortgage employee could not be the basis for the relief sought because (1) the leases were tacitly approved, and (2) the claim made no allegation as to the method of calculating the purchase price rendering the lease unconscionable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that although the purchase option was timely exercised, defendants failed to bring a timely action for specific performance pursuant to statute. Thus, their claim for specific performance was time-barred, and the limitation period was not tolled by operation of estoppel or any other equitable tolling principle. The court also found that defendants did not prove that the leases were unconscionable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed an appeal and application for review of statements of compensation against defendant. The appeal challenged defendant's valuation regarding plaintiff's property which was taken by defendant in an eminent domain proceeding. Plaintiff moved for summary judgment arguing that defendant improperly deducted from the market value of plaintiff's property due to alleged environmental contamination and impairment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was unpersuaded that plaintiff's vested right was impaired as he was still entitled to compensation for defendant's condemnation of his property, even if he had to subsequently seek a set-off. 2000 Conn. Pub. Acts 89 was retroactive and did not affect plaintiff's vested rights. The determination of just compensation resided in the exclusive control of the judiciary and the enactment of 2000 Conn. Pub. Acts 89 did not impermissibly intrude upon the judicial function. Plaintiff did not claim that the statute impinged on a suspect class or a fundamental right, nor was there a basis for such a claim. The court was not required to address plaintiff's equal protection argument, since it was not properly briefed. However, even if the court were to address it, under the rational relationship standard, plaintiff's challenge failed as the act was related to the legitimate government purpose of assessing a variety of factors in an eminent domain proceeding. There was no equal protection violation because the act was rationally related to a legitimate government purpose and provided a mechanism for plaintiff to bring a subsequent action to recover remediation costs.</SPAN></P>

Further, the trial court found that the record supported defendant's findings regarding the goals and recommendations of the plan.

The mother was homeless and had a history of substance abuse. The father denied such problems but refused to allow petitioner to visit his residence. The court found that respondents had abandoned the child, and neither had attempted to spend any significant amount of time with the child or made efforts to comply with petitioner's reasonable reunification efforts.
