</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of narcotics, possession of drug paraphernalia, and operating under the influence in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 21a-279(a) , 21a-267(a), and 14-227a. Before jury selection, the State filed a two-count part B information charging him as a second-time offender. Defendant filed a motion under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 41-8 to dismiss the second count on grounds of vindictive prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the State had vindictively filed the second count of the part B information, which charged him as a second-time drug offender, because he had rejected a plea bargain. He argued that this violated his constitutional rights. The court held that as the information had been filed before the trial, defendant had to show actual vindictiveness. A prosecutor could lawfully file additional charges and seek a greater sentence if a defendant did not accept the State's offer. The prosecutor had represented that he did not know defendant prior to trial and that he regularly filed a part B information if a defendant had a prior conviction. Additionally, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-279(a) clearly stated an increased penalty for second offenders, and defendant knew whether he had a previous drug conviction. Thus, the prosecutor's failure to inform defendant after he declined a plea bargain that he would be filing the amendment did not support an appearance of actual vindictiveness. Furthermore, the prosecutor was legally justified in filing the part B information, and therefore the increase in the potential penalty did not lead the court to find actual vindictiveness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus which challenged his convictions for assault in the first degree, attempt to commit assault in the first degree, risk of injury to a child, and criminal possession of a firearm. The prisoner alleged, inter alia, ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and actual innocence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner an individual along an alleyway while shooting at him. A young girl was shot. The court held that it was clear that the prisoner's trial counsel exercised a reasonable strategic approach on the sufficiency of the evidence issue. The decision of both trial and appellate counsel not to focus on the sufficiency of the evidence claim regarding the element of intent was reasonably sound given the theory of the case pursued by the defense and the evidence presented at the criminal trial. Consequently, the prisoner failed to overcome the presumption that under the circumstances, the challenged action was sound trial and appellate strategy. There was no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct. Since the jury could have reasonably found that the prisoner discharged his firearm with the intent to physically injury one person and that act was at the same time likely to impair the health of a child, there was no reason for the attorneys to assert a legally inconsistent verdict claim. The prisoner did not submit any newly discovered evidence and thus, failed to even make the threshold requirement by which a claim of actual innocence could be pursued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother sought a determination of paternity, an order of custody, educational support and any other equitable relief. Defendant putative father argued, inter alia, that the mother failed to show that the court had personal jurisdiction over him pursuant to the Connecticut long-arm statute for paternity matters and otherwise failed to show the existence of minimum contacts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At all relevant times, the putative father claimed to have resided in Florida. No evidence was provided to show that he resided within Connecticut at any relevant time. There was no personal jurisdiction over him pursuant to the language of the long-arm statute for paternity matters, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-160. The court found notice was performed in the manner prescribed for service of process within Connecticut and was therefore found to be sufficient for the purposes of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA). The putative father neither acknowledged paternity nor was found to be the father of the child. He was therefore not a &quot;parent&quot; for the purposes of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-61. Furthermore, there was no existing jurisdictional basis for the mother to pursue such a finding in Connecticut. The putative father had sufficient notice of the custody claim, pursuant to the UCCJEA, to protect his interest in participating in the child's future care and control. An order of sole custody in favor of the mother did not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative father's motion to dismiss as to paternity was granted. To the extent that the mother sought sole custody of the minor child, the motion to dismiss was denied. To the extent that the mother sought an order of educational support, the motion to dismiss was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractor applied for an order for defendant state officials to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not issue commanding them to implement a compromise and pay the contractor for work done by the contractor. The state officials responded with a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor provided services to the State of Connecticut in the construction and renovation of buildings at a community college. After disputes arose as to the value of the contractor's services; negotiations ensued, and a compromise was agreed to between the contractor and the administrator of the state agency to which the services were provided. The Attorney General of Connecticut, recommended to the Governor of Connecticut, that the compromise be accepted. The Governor agreed, and, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 3-7(c), authorized the agency administrator to pay the compromise amount in full settlement of the disputed claim. However, the agency administrator did not pay the contractor, despite the contractor's demands for payment. The contractor then alleged that the inaction of state officers in not paying the contractor was in excess of or in contravention of their duties. The court found that the complaint sufficiently alleged that the failure of state officials to pay the contractor's claim as authorized by the Governor was in violation of their duties under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4-5 and 3-117(a). Thus, the doctrine of sovereign immunity did not bar the contractor's claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developer appealed a decision of defendant zoning board of appeals which denied its appeal from a decision of the zoning enforcement officer (ZEO) who denied the developer's application for a zoning permit to construct a single-family dwelling on the property. The ZEO determined the application did not meet requirements for frontage per zoning definitions for frontage on a street.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer had a contract to purchase the property from the record owner. The property was landlocked in a section of wooded acreage which was surrounded by residential development. It appeared to be an early development plan showing that the property would be bounded on the south by a proposed street and on the north by a proposed street. The streets were never built or accepted by the city. The property did not have any frontage on an abutting street accepted by the city or state. The court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-27 had no bearing on a situation where a town through its zoning regulations restricted building to lots adjoining city streets or state roads. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-27 applied to building on unaccepted streets. There was no unaccepted street involved. The taking argument failed because there was no evidence that the city's decision was confiscatory in nature. Implied acceptance did not apply because it was without doubt that no work of any kind had been performed within 250 feet of the property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate murdered a woman and took his girlfriend to the crime scene where she saw some burned items.

The inmate had trial counsel, and in addition to other witnesses, the girlfriend testified against the inmate. In considering the habeas petition, the court explained the test applicable under Strickland to a claim of ineffective assistance, ruling that while counsel had committed minor errors, they did not in the aggregate amount to a deprivation of the inmate's Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel and that perfect representation was not required. The court also explained the history of habeas corpus relief, ruling that while the State had the burden of proof in the criminal trial, the inmate had the burden of proving his entitlement to a writ of habeas corpus. The court also concluded that his conviction was reliable, based on the evidence admitted, which included his girlfriend's important testimony. The clear import of her testimony was that he had led her to the site, so that he must have been the one who committed the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed a suit against defendants, the Town of Branford, Connecticut, and its officials, challenging a property tax assessment. They also included a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and an administrative appeal from the action of the Town of Branford Board of Assessment Appeals in valuing the property. A central issue was whether the taxpayers had a private right of action for damages or whether the statutory scheme was exclusive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers relied on several statutes and the state and federal constitutions. The court, with one exception, dismissed the counts in the complaint. Defendants raised the statute of limitations with regard to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-121f, but the court ruled that they had no right to raise the issue in a motion to strike as there was a conflict as to the relevant assessment dates and because an action had been available at common law to challenge an assessment, precluding that defense. The court rejected the constitutional claims raised under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, ruling that there was a comprehensive statutory scheme in place to address an assessment and valuation and that a &sect; 1983 action thus did not lie. The court also found that the statutory remedies, as they appeared in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-121f, 12-117a, and 12-119, were adequate, noting that when an appeal from an administrative decision was available, the appeal constituted an adequate alternate legal remedy under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court also ruled that the Branford, Conn., Code did not provide a private right of action for damages, that neither did the state constitution, and that there was no official misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion to strike 11 counts of the complaint and dismissed four counts. To the extent that claims were made personally against the officials, the court struck counts 11 and 17. The court denied the balance of the motion to strike those counts and denied the motion to strike counts one through nine and 23. The court ordered an amended complaint to be filed and gave specific directions about its structure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state marshal (SM) filed suit against defendants, the State of Connecticut and the State Marshal Commission, seeking a declaratory judgment that, inter alia, defendants exceeded their statutory authority by treating SMs as state employees and that SMs were unconstitutionally deprived of their property and were forced into involuntary servitude. The SM also sought injunctive relief and damages. Defendants sought dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission implemented a policy in order to ensure the timely processing of restraining orders, wherein SMs were required to be present at an assigned courthouse during set hours. The SM filed suit, seeking declarations regarding the unlawfulness and unconstitutionality of the policy, seeking to enjoin further enforcement of it, and requesting damages for his compliance with the policy. Defendants sought dismissal of the complaint on sovereign immunity grounds. The court held that there was no applicable legislative waiver of sovereign immunity for purposes of the first exception to sovereign immunity. As to the second exception, the policy did not interfere with any of the SM's constitutional rights, as service could be made as the SM saw fit, he was not deprived of an interest of constitutional magnitude, and he did not have to do the job if he chose not to for purposes of the involuntary servitude claim. Accordingly, there was no violation of U.S. Const. amends. V, XIII, or XIV, or Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Further, there was no excess of authority by the Commission, as it was authorized under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 6-38b(g) and (k) to implement the policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the City of West Haven (Connecticut) and its delinquent tax collection agent, moved to dismiss and for summary judgment on the sole remaining issue in the action filed by plaintiff taxpayers. The remaining issue centered on whether defendants were constitutionally required to provide prior notice that a 15% collection fee would be imposed on delinquent taxpayers if their real property taxes were not paid on time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' motion to dismiss was based on the argument that the court was without jurisdiction to consider the taxpayers' claim because the taxpayers had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The motion for summary judgment was based on the argument that due process did not require prior notice of the tax collection fee. The court denied the motion to dismiss, holding that no administrative procedure, including the procedure in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-129, was available to taxpayers to contest the legality of the collection of fees. The motion for summary judgment was granted. Due process did not require a pre-deprivation proceeding prior to the exaction of taxes. The provision of post-payment procedures for contesting taxes satisfied due process. The taxpayers did not provide any support for their proposition that notice be given prior to the tax deprivation where only post-deprivation relief was required, and the court found no such support itself. Further, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-166, which authorized tax collectors to impose collection fees on unpaid taxes, provided the taxpayers with prior notice that the fees could be assessed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' motion to dismiss was denied, but their motion for summary judgment was granted.</SPAN></P>

The parties agreed to submit only state issues on the DPUC's jurisdiction and on whether substantial evidence supported the determination, and they withheld all other issues for an appeal in federal court. The court found that the DPUC had jurisdiction pursuant to the declaratory judgment statute of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-176(a). The DPUC had jurisdiction over the company's petition regarding its right under the EPA as the DPUC had approved the EPA. Also, the DPUC had jurisdiction over interpretations and applications of its own regulations and decisions. Finally, there was sufficient evidence to support the DPUC's determination that the GISCs were an integral part of the renewable energy that the company bought from the producer under the EPA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff energy producer brought an administrative appeal under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183, and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-35 to challenge a decision by defendant Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC), which granted ownership of Generation Information System Certificates (GISCs) to a power company that purchased energy from the producer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a decision on separate petitions for declaratory rulings, the DPUC granted the company ownership of GISCs that were issued for one of the producer's trash to energy facilities. The facility's electrical output was delivered to the company under an energy purchase agreement (EPA) that was approved by the DPUC many years before the GISCs came into existence. The DPUC agreed with the company's position that the EPA entitled it to the facility's entire electrical output, including the GISCs. The GISCs could be sold to other electrical suppliers so those suppliers could meet the DPUC's renewable energy regulations and decisions created pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 16-243(a), 245a. The DPUC rejected the producer's argument that the GISCs were unrelated to electricity that was sold to the company. On appeal, the court agreed with the DPUC's finding that the GISCs were a quantification of the renewable energy attributes of the generated electricity and that the GISCs did not exist apart from that electricity. Under the EPA, the company bought the facility's entire electrical output, which included GISCs that were inseparable from the renewable energy produced at the facility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two cases brought by plaintiffs, various property owners and a homeowners association, were consolidated on appeal with regard to their challenge of the adoption by defendant, a town planning and zoning commission, of building and zoning regulation amendments concerning the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) within residential zones. One suit was brought under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8 to void the amendments and the second suit sought a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The declaratory judgment action sought to have the FAR amendments declared unconstitutional. With regard to the first suit brought by plaintiffs, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8, the court agreed that all plaintiffs were aggrieved parties as required under the statute but that the suit was time barred as a result of plaintiffs failing to file their appeal within one year from the commission's action/decision. Namely, commissions's decision on the attic and basement amendments took place on April 16, 2002, and plaintiffs commenced their action on April 29, 2003. The court held that a failure to file a zoning appeal within the statutory time period deprived the court of jurisdiction over the appeal. As to the declaratory judgment action, the court found that substantial evidence in the record supported the commission's action. The court found that the commission's actions in reducing the FAR standards between 8 or 10 percent in areas with a previous FAR, and creating FAR standards in areas without previous restrictions based upon the housing stock in those areas, were in accordance with the town plan and in furtherance of the public health, safety, and welfare of the town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed both appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to marriage, the wife became a permanent resident of the United States. After the parties' marriage in Jamaica, she filed immigration papers to sponsor the husband to live in the United States. His temporary right to live and work in the country expired, and, if divorce was ordered before he completed the remainder of his immigration process, he could not remain in the country. The wife was the only person who could validly sponsor him. The husband claimed the family court had the power to order the wife to sponsor him either under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-1 as a matter affecting dissolution of marriage or under the court's equity power. The court found it could complete all aspects of the dissolution without entering that order and forcing the wife to participate in an immigration process that was lengthy and costly and could force her into a potential obligation to support the husband as his sponsor was not related to any of the family matters under &sect; 46b-1. Regardless, the court would not exercise its discretion to enter the requested order. The parties had no relationship and had not lived together for six years, so there was no reason to delay the parties' divorce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city zoning commission filed a motion to dismiss claims by plaintiff property owners that the commission's approval of a zoning amendment constituted an unconstitutional taking of their property in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The owners opposed the motion to dismiss and moved to file additional evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners appealed approval of a zoning amendment on various grounds. The court allowed the owners to amend the appeal to add unconstitutional taking claims. The commission moved to dismiss the additional claims, arguing they were not ripe without a final decision applying the amendment to disallow any reasonable use of the property. The owners contended that the motion should be denied because it was not made within 30 days of the commission's appearance, as required by Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 10-30, and that the court's decision to allow amendment to add the claim was law of the case. They also argued the claim was ripe. The court found that ripeness impacted subject matter jurisdiction, which could be challenged at any time, and that the issue was not previously considered, so law of the case was inapplicable. Some of the claims were not ripe without action applying the amendment to cause economic loss for which the owners were not compensated. But, claims that the commission exceeded its authority in approving the amendment and that the amendment did not fit the city's comprehensive plan were facial challenges that were ripe when the amendment was enacted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed those parts of the owners' additional claims that raised as-applied taking claims, but the court denied the motion to dismiss those claims that raised facial challenges to the amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the state legislature's government administration and elections committee, and the committee's co-chairs (GAEC), moved to dismiss an action by plaintiffs, a building company and several individuals , who filed a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief that would protect them against enforcement of legislative subpoenas that the GAEC issued to compel plaintiffs' attendance at committee hearings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In seeking protection from the GAEC's subpoenas, the plaintiffs alleged that the GAEC was not authorized to issue them, that the subpoenas were improperly served, and that issuance of the subpoenas fell outside the protections of the speech or debate clause (SDC) of Conn. Const. art. III, &sect; 15. The GAEC moved to dismiss, claiming the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to SDC immunity. They claimed that the subpoenas were issued in furtherance of the GAEC's consideration of possible revisions to state ethics laws, which was squarely within the matters delegated to the GAEC by the state's joint rules of the senate and house of representatives. The court found that, if the GAEC's subpoenas were within its sphere of legitimate legislative activity, the GAEC was absolutely immune from judicial review. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 2-46(a) specifically authorized the legislature to issue subpoenas. Op. Conn. Att'y. Gen. 84-130 (November 16, 1984) stated that the &sect; 2-46(a) subpoena powers were intended to be comprehensive. Since the GAEC's ethics investigation was within its sphere of legitimate legislative activity, issuance of the subpoenas was protected by the SDC.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate filed suit against defendants, his attorney, his attorney's office, the retired chief of legal services for the public defender services, and the State of Connecticut, for violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and common law claims. The Attorney General for Connecticut filed a motion to dismiss on behalf of the State and the retired chief of legal services. The attorney filed a motion to dismiss on behalf of himself and his law office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged that (1) he did not have proper assistance of counsel; (2) the attorney misled the inmate; (3) the attorney gave him false information under oath and committed perjury against the inmate, and (4) the chief of legal services was negligent in his actions and responsible for the actions of the attorney. The court found that (1) the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred the inmate from suing the State of Connecticut; (2) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165 barred the claims against the chief of legal services as there were no allegations that he acted recklessly, wantonly, or maliciously or outside the scope of his employment; (3) 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 did not support a claim based on respondeat superior; (4) the allegation that the chief of legal services was negligent in failing to respond to letters by the inmate was not a constitutional tort under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983; and (5) the attorney, as a special public defender, did not act under color of state law under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. However the attorney and his office were not immune to the common law claims. Further, the inmate stated a cause of action against the attorney and his office as to the common law claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss the complaint against the retired chief of legal services and the State of Connecticut was granted.

The administrator brought consortium claims individually and wrongful death claims as temporary administrator for the estate of his wife, alleging medical malpractice against the doctors and against other health care provider defendants who did not move for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator alleged that negligent care provided by the doctors and others resulted in serious injuries to, and the subsequent death of, his wife. Before expiration of the two year statute of limitations under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-555 (SOL), the administrator filed for, and received, an automatic 90-day extension of the SOL pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-190a(b). On summary judgment, the doctors argued that the &sect; 52-190a(b) petition was facially defective, and that &sect; 52-190a(b) was unconstitutional since it divested a property right in the limitations period provided by the SOL through an ex parte procedure. The court found that a facial error in transposing names was not fatal to the petition. Also, the SOL was modified by &sect; 52-190a(b) after the administrator filed a good faith certificate in compliance with &sect; 52-190a(a), thereby creating a property right to a limitations period of 2 years and 90 days. The certificate was a benefit to the doctors by forcing an adequate investigation of the claims, and it was a burden on the administrator that ordinary personal injury and wrongful death claimants did not have. The automatic extension was necessary to offset that burden.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the doctors' motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-231(n). The father filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the appeal was untimely and moot. The court did dismiss the appeal, stating that in order to prevail the State was required to establish that the magistrate interfered with a function that had been assigned exclusively to the office of the attorney general. Nothing in the State's legislative or constitutional scheme granted the office of the attorney general the power to direct the conduct of support enforcement officers, employees of the judicial branch. Nothing prevented magistrates from imposing reasonable rules and regulations upon those support enforcement officers. Thus, the separation of powers argument failed. The State also argued that the magistrate interfered with support enforcement's authority to act pursuant to &sect; 46b-231(s)(1). The court disagreed however, stating that the restriction was on a non-party. There was no injunction. There were no monetary sanctions. The litigants were allowed to file any motion they wished to pursue.</SPAN></P>

The court denied those motions, holding that the law in Connecticut permitted damages for emotional distress in wrongful birth cases where, as in the case at bar, the emotional distress was a direct and proximate result of the defendant's negligence. The court also held that: (1) there was no support for the contention that defendant owed no duty to the father, and the jury finding as to the father was supported by sufficient evidence, even though the father did testify about his own emotional distress; (2) there was no error in admitting evidence of the licensing status of an employee midwife, evidence from the mother concerning the course she would have taken, or evidence of the child's physical condition and his interaction with the parents; (3) the evidence supported the damage awards; and (4) an award of prejudgment interest under Conn.

Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 10-30, defendants filed a motion to dismiss nine counts of the complaint. Defendants claimed that all of the claims against them were barred by state common-law sovereign immunity and state statutory immunity. The court found that the motion to dismiss based on sovereign immunity should be denied. The complaint could be reasonably construed to bring claims against defendants in their individual capacities. Further, statutory immunity, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165, was not available to defendants. To permit the defense of state statutory immunity to be asserted would undermine the supremacy of federal law.

The company brought an apportionment complaint against defendant Department of Public Safety officials under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-102(b), asserting, inter alia, negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that the exhaustion of administrative remedies would be futile because the town had demonstrated an absolute unwillingness to act. The court rejected plaintiff's claim of futility. It was undisputed that no evidence had been adduced that plaintiff, or any of its members, ever exercised the right to appeal a zoning officer's opinion following her investigation. Because plaintiff offered no analysis, the court could not conclude that the remedies available to it by way of injunctive and/or declaratory relief against the company were inadequate. Nor could the court conclude that plaintiff had a clear legal right to the relief sought in that discovery was ongoing and the evidence was incomplete. The court found that the apportionment complaint did not sound in a cause of action other than negligence and that the officials were not immune from suit in their official capacities under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. However, the court concluded that it was without personal jurisdiction over the officials regarding plaintiff's original complaint because the apportionment complaint was untimely under Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff incorporated businesses brought an action against defendant town, seeking a declaration that an ordinance regulating truck traffic had been enacted in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-298 and that it violated due process and equal protection guarantees under the United States and Connecticut Constitutions. They also sought awards of money damages to cover the losses they claimed to have sustained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the town decided to limit truck traffic in an area that had grown increasingly residential, it modeled its ordinance on one that had been found constitutional some years earlier, and it adopted the same weight limit for trucks to be banned from a stretch of road. The ordinance contained an exemption for certain truck-owning businesses that were near the beginning of the restricted stretch, on grounds that avoiding the road would cause their trucks to drive through even more residential neighborhoods. Other local businesses that had not been exempted challenged the ordinance, first, as violating &sect; 14-298, which required approval of a state agency for any local legislation that affected through traffic and, second, as violating constitutional guarantees. The latter claim boiled down to a challenge under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held, first, that since the businesses' trucks were not engaged in through traffic, since they were based in the town, they lacked standing under &sect; 14-298. Second, the ordinance was rationally based in the desire to reduce noise and protect pedestrians in residential neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner argued, inter alia, that a witness should not have been called because her cross-examination brought out the fact that she had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary. The habeas court disagreed. Counsel called the witness based on the petitioner's assertion that the witness had indicated that the victim had changed her story and was not sure if the petitioner had been one of the persons who committed the crime. Counsel's litigation decision to call the witness was made after the petitioner informed counsel that her testimony could be used to discredit the victim's testimony. That was an informed strategic choice made by counsel for the petitioner on information supplied by the petitioner and clearly met the performance prong of Strickland. A fair assessment of counsel's performance required that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight and to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct and evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time. The petitioner failed to prove that counsel's performance was deficient and also failed to prove that his performance in calling the witness prejudiced the defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff executrix, on behalf of an estate and herself, brought a wrongful death action against defendant hospital, for alleged medical malpractice that caused the death of the decedent. The executrix, as an executrix, obtained a 90-day extension of the applicable statute of limitations from the clerk of the superior court pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-190a. The hospital filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital claimed that service of the complaint was untimely. It further claimed it was deprived of a vested property right in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as the ex parte procedure in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-190a(b), which extended the statute of limitations by 90 days, deprived the hospital of its vested property right to an exemption, if suit was not brought within two years. The court found that the hospital had property rights, not in a two-year limitation period, but in a statute of limitations of two years and 90 days. Because the hospital did not have a vested property right in a two-year statute of limitations, the automatic extension in &sect; 52-190a(b) did not give rise to a violation of constitutional rights. Further, a loss of consortium claim was not untimely under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-555 as the executrix's petition for extension of the statute of limitation extended by 90 days the time in which the claim had to be brought. Finally, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-593a, a remedial statute, applied to extend the statute of limitations contained in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-555, which was extended by the application of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-190a(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-111, appealed the assessment of his property to appellee Board of Assessment Appeals of the Town of Stonington, Connecticut, which reduced the assessment. The property owner petitioned for review of the Board's assessment pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-117a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner disputed the value that was assigned to his property in an assessment. He alleged the violation of two Connecticut statutes; namely, Con. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-62a(b) and 12-119; and a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, as well as a violation of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The owner claimed that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-119 provided relief to taxpayers who proved that an assessment was manifestly excessive as a result of the assessors violating statutory directives in arriving at the assessment. As to the constitutional challenges, the owner claimed that by assessing shoreline properties at a higher rate than inland properties the assessor and the Board placed a higher burden on owners of shoreline properties in violation of their right to equal protection. The court found that the property assessed in the town, including the owner's property, was valued at 70 percent in compliance with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-62a(b). Accordingly, the assessment of the owner's property was neither excessive nor illegal, and the assessment did not violate Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;12-119. Further, there was no evidence which supported an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner did not pay the company for paving work on its in-state property, which resulted in a mechanic's lien. The owner commenced an action to dissolve the lien. The company moved to dismiss the action, claiming Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 33-921(a) precluded the owner from bringing an action in the state since it failed to obtain a certificate of authority (CA) to transact business in the state. The owner claimed that its rights to open courts and to not have its property alienated by the lien would be violated if the action were dismissed. The owner further contended that &sect; 33-921 was unconstitutional because it was tantamount to a bill of attainder and violated due process. The court found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 33-921(c) permitted a stay to allow foreign businesses an opportunity to obtain a CA. The stay would not bar the owner from protecting any of its rights to open courts or to the non-alienation of property. Finally, the court determined that the stay procedure in &sect; 33-921 was not a bill of attainder since it applied to future, not past, conduct and since it had a clear, nonpunitive purpose of equalizing tax burdens between foreign and domestic corporations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the company's motion to dismiss without prejudice and ordered the owner to obtain a CA to transact business in the state.

The court found that the prisoner had abandoned any claims concerning class action status. The court found that the prisoner filed the action against defendants in their official capacities as state officers. When a plaintiff brought an action for money damages against the state, the plaintiff had to proceed through the office of the Claims Commissioner pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-141 et seq. Otherwise, the action had to be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the doctrine of sovereign immunity.

I, &sect; 8. the owner did not allege any facts that would demonstrate an illegal seizure of his vehicle, especially where police were allowed to remove and impound automobiles that violated parking ordinances, impeded traffic, or threatened public safety. As to due process, the owner's own allegations showed that he received notice of the city's parking policies and his violation of these policies. Moreover, he had notice on his parking tickets of the appeal period and of the city's policy of towing vehicles that accrued more than $ 200 in fines. Therefore, he failed to show a lack of due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff non-profit corporation filed suit against defendant City seeking to quiet title to certain real property. The corporation was permitted to conform its complaint to the evidence. The amended complaint re-alleged that any claimed delay in the corporation's performance of its obligations was caused by the City's failure to release funds to it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that the deed and the agreement were ambiguous and vague. The trial court held that the corporation failed to submit floor plans and specifications of proposed rehabilitation work as required by the agreement. &quot;Commenced construction of the improvements&quot; was not too vague and ambiguous to have been understood by the parties. The corporation did not begin construction on the property. The corporation's construction obligations were not contingent on an award of funds from the City. The reversionary interest in the deed was valid. The City took action to divest the corporation of the property as required by the quitclaim deed. The corporation was not prejudiced by any failure to comply with the quiet title statute. The City was not equitably estopped from claiming a default. The claim that the reversionary interest was void as it violated the rule against perpetuities was rejected as it was not raised in the pleadings. Further, the rule against perpetuities was not applicable to the City. The documents were not illegal or in violation of any public policy. Finally, the claim that the reversionary interest allowed an unconstitutional taking was not considered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was entered in favor of the City. Title to the subject property was found to be in the City, to the exclusion of the corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants sought a special exception under Plainville, Ct., Zoning Regulations, &sect; 502, to operate a weekly wholesale motor vehicle auction week and to allow related inventory accumulation and distribution activities. The commission denied the application. The applicants appealed, raising four claims: (1) that the commission's use of the local plan of conservation and development to reject the applications was erroneous; (2) that the commission did not form a consensus that the proposed use was a prohibited junk yard; (3) that, assuming storing &quot;junk&quot; was one of the commission's reasons for denying the application, the definition of &quot;junk&quot; in the zoning regulations was vague; and (4) that the reasons given by the commission lacked substantial evidence. The court found that the zoning regulations for granting special exceptions required compliance with the plan, so denial could be based on failure to satisfy the plan. Moreover, the record showed that the commission found the proposed use was to store &quot;junk,&quot; the definition of &quot;junk&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague, and substantial evidence supported a finding that storing inoperable motor vehicles constituted storing &quot;junk.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appealing the commission's denial of its application for a special exception to build a place of religious worship on its property, the society claimed the decision: (1) was arbitrary, illegal, and an abuse of its discretion; (2) violated the Connecticut Religious Freedom Act (RFA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-571b; and (3) violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000cc et seq. The court found the society did not show selective treatment to make out a prima facie equal protection claim. It also did not show the commission placed a substantial burden, as required for a RLUIPA claim, or even a burden, as required for a RFA claim, on the exercise of its religion. There was no evidence that the society could not use other sites in the town to build its place of worship, nor was there evidence that the commission would not impose the same traffic and safety requirements on any other entity seeking to build on the property. Finally, the commission did not act illegally, arbitrarily, or in abuse of discretion in applying town traffic and health regulations as reasons to deny the application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought habeas relief based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found that trial counsel's failure to perfect petitioner's sentence review application as provided in Conn. Gen.

The court found that petitioner's trial counsel provided quality representation, which resulted in petitioner being spared the death penalty despite the egregious and horrendous nature of his crimes. The court also held that petitioner's felony murder conviction was supported by sufficient evidence that showed petitioner's brother shot a police officer during the commission of a robbery with petitioner. The court found that it was petitioner's decision to exercise his constitutional right to silence at his trial and that even if he had testified there was no probability that the result would have been any different.</SPAN></P>

This matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the present action because the employee did not receive permission to sue them from the claims commission or, in the alternative, because she failed to bring the action pursuant to a statute in which the State had consented to be sued. However, the employee relied on Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165 by alleging that defendants engaged in intentional tortuous conduct. She also argued that her claims were viable in that they were based on conduct by defendants that violated &sect; 4-165, but her reliance on this statute was misplaced. Additionally, the third and fourth criteria under the test outlined in Spring v. Constantino were not met and the state indemnification statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-141d, was not applicable if the state officer/employee was wanton, reckless, or malicious in his or her acts. Thus, a judgment against the Commissioner, the Superintendent, and the former Superintendent on the basis of wanton, reckless, or malicious conduct would not subject the state to liability.</SPAN></P>

The car lessor moved for summary judgment and supplied supporting documents that it claimed showed it could not be held liable pursuant to Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner guardian ad litem (GAL) for respondent teenage minor sought a continuation of the court's earlier issued, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-129, order of temporary custody (OTC) placing custody in the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF). Nominal respondent parents urged the petition be granted, while the minor, through her attorney, and DCF opposed it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor's parents could not handle her. Her truancy and substance abuse were ongoing, and she eventually ran away to live with an older boyfriend. Although her attorney had not seen her in months, he appeared on her behalf when a GAL argued for the need to continue the OTC that had been in place, to at least give the State an opportunity to try to save her, if she could be found. The court held that Connecticut case law established the same burdens of proof for ex parte OTC proceedings and for formal contested proceedings. The petitioner in such a case had to show by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the child's safety and well-being were actually in danger. The showing could, however, be predictive, that is, a showing by a fair preponderance that the child would be endangered if not protected could support an OTC. The court held that in the minor's case, the evidence was more than adequate that the minor could not be cared for adequately by either parent. Therefore, it granted the continuation petition.</SPAN></P>

The wife argued that hospital personnel failed to failing to properly diagnose and/or treat a leaking aneurysm, and negligently failed to operate to correct the condition. In the summary judgment motion, the State argued that the action was barred by the statute of limitation for wrongful death actions under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-555(a). The wife argued that the tolling provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-160(d) renewed the statute of limitations when the wife filed a claim with a state agency. The court held that the tolling provision contained in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-160(d) merely provided an extension of time in which to bring a claim. It did not, however, authorize the limitation period contained in &sect; 52-555(a) to begin anew. The court found that the time the agency spent reviewing the claim was tolled, but that after the agency authorized the claim, the statute of limitations began to run again. The court further held that the wife failed to file the action against the State before the statute of limitations expired. Thus, the State was entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295. The victim sought money damages and double and treble damages pursuant to &sect; 14-295. The driver moved to strike the second count of the complaint and the claim for double and treble damages. The victim filed an objection to the motion to strike.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver argued that the victim could not allege identical facts in both the recklessness and negligence counts, nor penalize the driver for a negligence complaint disguised as a recklessness claim. Additionally, the driver argued that the recklessness claim had to be specifically pleaded. The court found that the specific pleading requirements for pleading common-law recklessness did not apply to pleading a case of statutory recklessness under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295. Further, allegations that the driver deliberately or with reckless disregard operated a motor vehicle in violation of one or more of the motor vehicle statutes enumerated in &sect; 14-295 and that the violation was a substantial factor in producing the victim's injuries were sufficient to state a case of statutory recklessness. Additionally, the allegations in the second count validly pleaded a case of recklessness under &sect; 14-295, and, even if the common-law pleading requirements for recklessness were applied, the second count satisfied those requirements as well. Finally, because the second count was not to be stricken, the prayer for relief seeking double or treble damages under &sect; 14-295 was also not to be stricken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to strike was denied, and the objection to the motion to strike was sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Count one alleged that the university and the coach were negligent in failing to properly supervise the meet, failing to properly train and supervise employees, and inadequately maintaining the warm-up area.

At oral argument, the injured party admitted that he was not opposing the motion to dismiss as to count one and that the motion to dismiss should be granted with respect to the university as to count three. The court found that under the Spring test, the action against the coach was in effect against the state. The coach was a state official, and the action occurred during his employment at a state university. The injured party did not allege anywhere that he was suing the coach in his individual capacity. Thus, the court held that the coach was immune pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165. Furthermore, the court found that the injured party failed to show any wanton or reckless conduct on the part of the coach. Thus, the motion to dismiss the third count had to be granted as to the coach as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The enforcement officer issued the cease and desist order to compel the owners to remove a display trailer which was parked in the set off in front of their property for advertising purposes for the business located on the property. The court initially held that the owners were aggrieved pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(a)(1) based on their ownership of the property. The owners argued that the trailer was not a structure as defined by the city's zoning regulations and thus it was not unlawful to keep the trailer in the setback. The court held that the board's determination that the trailer was a structure was supported by the Haddam, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 3, which defined a structure as a walled or building and other structures. The trailer was eight feet wide, 20 feet long, and was enclosed. Furthermore, the site plan clearly showed that the trailer took up several parking spots, rather than a single vehicle spot.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, several developers, a town, and the town council, filed a combined motion for summary judgment on plaintiff town residents' counts alleging the town exceeded its grant of authority and Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1, by approving an ordinance authorizing municipal bonds and allowing a special services district (SSD). They moved to dismiss a count alleging the council exceeded its authority in allowing the SSD.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents challenged a town ordinance issuing bonds and approving master agreements (MA) allowing an SSD that was favorable to the developers. They alleged the town exceeded its authority in many ways, including granting exclusive public privileges to the developers contrary to Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1. They also claimed the town acted arbitrarily, the MA unfairly placed the burden of repaying bonds on taxpayers outside the SSD without a vote, and the council improperly approved the SSD. The town, developers, and council sought summary judgment on all counts except they sought dismissal of the challenge to the council's action. The court found Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-148(c)(3)(A) allowed the town to dispose of property for public purposes, including to encourage private development. Since the SSD was created for a public purpose, the town did not exceed it authority. Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1, was not violated as public purpose was served. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-339s allowed the bond repayment. The residents raised an issue on whether the town acted arbitrarily. But, dismissal was granted since the residents had standing under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(b) to challenge council's action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the town and the developers summary judgment on all counts except the one alleging the town acted arbitrarily in issuing the bonds and in entering the MA.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The club proposed to build a private golf course. The portion located in Norfolk was located in a rural residential zone, and a special permit was required. The neighbors argued that the commission acted illegally and arbitrarily and in abuse of its discretion in making it a condition of approval that all construction traffic flow though a single road, while a second road was available in the area. The court held that there was evidence in the record from which the commission could have concluded that the second road was simply inadequate to handle construction traffic while the designated road was capable of handling such traffic. The commission was allowed to impose conditions on a special permit necessary to protect public safety as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2. The neighbors also argued that the commission approved the use of two guest cottages for temporary lodging of members and guests. Norfolk, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 180-24B(11) allowed for customary accessory services, as well as golf, on the property. The court held that the commission did not abuse its discretion in determining that the guest cottages would be a customary accessory service.</SPAN></P>

The company filed a motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds. The court found it was undisputed that, in a prior decision, the company had been found to be an arm of the state and entitled to sovereign immunity from UMB claims under identical facts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was acquitted of a sexual assault but was serving a prison term for burglary and assault convictions. In granting habeas corpus relief, the court found that petitioner and his witness were credible and that witnesses for the warden were not. In particular, the director of offender classification at respondent department of correction was not credible in his assertion that he was unaware of the departmental rule that prohibited the use, for classification purposes, of charges on which an offender was found not guilty. The court found, contrary to the department's claims, that petitioner was labeled as a sex offender. Further, petitioner had a liberty interest in not being labeled as a sex offender, his liberty interest was violated by the department, and the department burdened him with an atypical and significant hardship because the classification made him ineligible for certain programs, including minimum security facility, halfway house, work release, educational work release, and community release.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the original owner of a parcel of land, sought a declaratory judgment for the delivery of a lease, held in escrow, for a leasehold interest in land located in defendant town. Defendant assignee, along with the town, claimed three special defenses. The town also sought dismissal of the action based on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff had owned 845 acres of land. The assignee obtained rights to the property, which had been transferred to a trust. The rights were outlined in an amended sales agreement between the trust and the original buyer. A power plant was to be constructed on the property. The amended agreement included a clause that leased back 52 acres of land to plaintiff. The lease was held in escrow by the trust. The amended agreement was further memorialized in correspondence between the parties. After the amended agreement was entered into, changes to the power plant plans required additional approval by Connecticut's sitting council (CSC). CSC approved the changes, but not the lease, and ordered that the 52 acres be transferred to the town. The court ruled in favor of the assignee and town on the first special defense that a condition precedent to delivery of the lease had not been met. The amended agreement and the correspondence required approval by CSC of both the plan changes and the lease. The court rejected the special defenses of illegal lease and collateral estoppel. The court also denied the motion to dismiss and ruled that CSC was not an indispensible party to the litigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's claim for a declaratory ruling in its favor was denied. Instead, the court ruled in favor of defendants' on the first special defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student became friends with a male teacher. While the student was a visitor at the teacher's house in 1978, he kissed her and touched her inappropriately. The student's mother reported the teacher's action to school officials, who failed to take any action. The third, fifth, and sixth counts alleged that defendants were vicariously liable for the teacher's negligent conduct pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-557n. The alleged improper conduct took place during the summer at the teacher's home. Thus, the court found that the teacher was not acting within the scope of his employment. Count seven alleged that defendants were negligent in failing to supervise, evaluate, and investigate the teacher. The court found that the fact that the teacher had taken the student to a school dance as his &quot;date&quot; prior to the alleged sexual assault was sufficient to raise an issue of fact as to whether the student was an identifiable victim and thus as to whether the school was immune. The court finally found that the action was brought within the Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-577d&nbsp;statute of limitations and found that defendants failed to show that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment was granted in favor of defendants on counts three, five, six, and nine. Summary judgment was denied as to count seven.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former student filed a multi-count complaint alleging that defendant teacher kissed, inappropriately touched, and sexually assaulted her many years before. The former student alleged that defendants, a school employee, regional school district, and supervisory school district, failed to investigate allegations as to the teacher. The school employee, regional school district, and supervisory school district moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former student was approximately 37 years old when she filed a multi-count complaint against the teacher, school employee, regional school district, and supervisory school district. She alleged that the teacher inappropriately kissed and touched her as well as sexually abused her and sexually assaulted her. She alleged that the school employee, regional school district, and supervisory school district were vicariously liable for the teacher's conduct and were negligent and that she was entitled to indemnification. The school employee, regional school district, and supervisory school district filed a motion for summary judgment on her claims directed against them. The trial court found that they could not be liable to her because the teacher's sexual misconduct did not further any of their interests. It also found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-235 did not provide the former student with a direct cause of action. However, it also found that a genuine issue of material fact existed about whether they were negligent in failing to supervise, evaluate, and investigate the teacher.</SPAN></P>

However, it denied summary judgment as to her claim that defendants negligently failed to supervise, evaluate, and investigate the teacher.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defendant's criminal case, he filed two motions. One was for a court-ordered psychiatric examination of the child complainant to determine if the complainant was capable of telling the truth. The court found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-86h automatically allowed the child complainant to testify and that the defense's concerns could be addressed through cross-examination, including examination on the psychiatric report that allegedly indicated the child was unable to tell the truth. The court found that, as to the second motion, the first part that requested the court terminate jury selection had been previously denied and jury selection was completed. Moreover, as to the balance of the motion, it was denied in its entirety. As far as a request for a continuance went, the court had already granted a continuance that was requested by both sides and there was no indication how the State Attorney's comment that defendant's spouse was under criminal investigation compromised the witness to an incurable degree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a correctional facility, a nurse at the facility, and the commissioner of the department of correction (state officials), filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff inmate's action alleging a multitude of claims for damages. The motion alleged a lack subject matter jurisdiction due to sovereign immunity and statutory immunity under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged that the state officials falsified evidence and disseminated false information, which defamed him, caused him to be arrested, falsely imprisoned, and placed in administrative detention, and caused him emotional distress. He also alleged wilful and malicious conduct. The state officials moved to dismiss on immunity grounds. It was unclear whether the inmate's claims for monetary damages and injunctive and declaratory relief were directed at the nurse and commissioner in their individual or official capacities. In their official capacities, the state officials were immune from monetary damage claims since there was no statutory waiver of sovereign immunity. Also, the inmate never brought his claims to the claims commissioner, as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4-141 through 4-165b to avoid dismissal. However, the inmate's allegations of fraudulent and illegal conduct were sufficient to claim conduct in excess of the state officials' authority, which justified declaratory and injunctive relief. In their individual capacities, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165, the state officials were not immune from liability for their reckless and willful acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the state officials' motion to dismiss as to the inmate's claims for monetary damages in their official capacities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners sought a RAP that included approval of regulated activities, including a wetlands crossing by a proposed driveway. The agency approved the RAP but denied the application insofar as it proposed to fill wetlands to build a driveway. The owners brought several issues on appeal, including whether the agency's decision was supported by substantial evidence, whether it met due process by failing to disqualify certain members from voting due to insufficient preparation or predetermination, and whether the agency stated legally sufficient findings and reasons consistent with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-42a. The court found that evidence supported the agency's determination that any destruction of the wetlands was significant and that the owners failed to meet their burden of showing that no feasible and prudent alternative to their proposal existed concerning the driveway. The court premised its dismissal of the appeal on that reasoning. The court found that evidence existed that a bridge over the wetlands as an alternative to destruction was feasible from an engineering perspective. Finally, the reasons provided in the agency's decisional order were sufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Connecticut Chief Animal Control Officer, applied for an order to show cause why he should not have permanent custody of an owner's seven horses pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22-328(b), 22-329a, 53-247(a). The owner moved to dismiss or to strike.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22-328(b) authorized the Officer to seek custody of animals that were deemed neglected under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22-329a. Under &sect; 22-329a, the Officer could take charge of an animal neglected or cruelly treated in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22-366, 22-415, 53-247 to 53-251. Prohibited activities under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-247(a) included failing to give an animal proper care, food, drink, or protection from the weather. The statutory provisions were not unconstitutionally vague either as written or as applied to the owner. The term &quot;neglect&quot; was clearly defined in common use and by the statutes. A person of ordinary intelligence could determine with a reasonable degree of certainty whether her treatment of the horses violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22-329a. The court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the owner neglected her horses. Lay witnesses and the Officer's and the owner's veterinarians testified to the horses' living conditions. The corral was full of mud and muck 12 inches deep. The stalls were small. The horses were inadequately protected from cold weather. The veterinarians testified how those conditions jeopardized the horses' health.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the owner's motion. The court found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22-328(b), 22-329a, 53-247(a) were not unconstitutional as written or as applied. The court found the owner neglected the horses. The court entered its judgment for the Officer and vested ownership of the horses in the State. The court ordered the owner to pay an amount to the State toward the daily cost of the care of the horses for so long as they were in its care.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The complaint raised the single claim that respondent warden had incorrectly determined the inmate's discharge date. The relief sought by the inmate was the application of statutory good time credits to his controlling sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In Connecticut, good time eligible offenses were crimes committed prior to October 1, 1994, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-100d. Because the inmate's offense date, &quot;1993-1995,&quot; straddled or overlapped October 1, 1994, it was not immediately clear whether his controlling sentence was good time eligible. It was clear to the court that the warden in good faith attempted to determine the controlling sentence and discharge date. However, the evidence showed that many instances of the offenses occurred, both prior to and after October 1, 1994. It followed that the inmate was convicted for offenses committed on or after October 1, 1994. Consequently, his controlling sentence was good time ineligible. The court found the inmate's reliance on Rawls and the rule of lenity was misplaced, as there was neither an ambiguity in the applicable good time statutes that triggered the rule of lenity, nor was there any risk of harsher punishment. Blakely was also inapplicable. The critical issue in Blakely was a sentence exceeding the standard range. The underlying sentences in the instant petition did not exceed the statutorily permissible maximum, nor had the inmate made such an allegation.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165, and failure to exhaust remedies under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-141 and their claims of setoff. The warden and the CO sought to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate sued the warden and the CO in their individual capacities under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 on alleged federal constitutional rights violations after the CO placed him in a locked room with an inmate who assaulted him after he requested segregation from that inmate because he feared an attack. The warden and the CO claimed sovereign immunity, arguing the claims were essentially for money judgments against the state. They claimed there was no proof of reckless or wanton conduct to qualify for liability under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165. Finally, they claimed failure to exhaust Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-141 remedies and entitlement to a setoff for money the state paid on the inmate's behalf. The inmate sought to strike the defenses. The CO and the warden sought dismissal of the action. The court found that the inmate's action was against the CO and the warden individually, so sovereign immunity was inapplicable. Moreover, the Supremacy Clause prevented them from avoiding 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 liability based on state statutory immunity. Exhaustion was not necessary since claims were not against the state. Finally, a setoff was unavailable for money owed to the state, which was a third party.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to dismiss, and the court struck the special defenses and the claim for a setoff.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, who was behind the wheel, gave a false name. While the officer was running the false name, defendant approached the officer and confessed that he was the owner and that his license was suspended. Thereafter, defendant was issued a misdemeanor summons for operating under suspension. The court held that defendant had no expectation of privacy in the registration plate displayed on the exterior of the car in plain view. The officer, having a reasonable suspicion that the operator might have been driving with a suspended license, acted within the scope of his authority under Conn. Gen.

The prisoner retained the special public defender to represent him on appeal. The prisoner claimed that the defender was negligent in failing to properly present to the appellate court the claim that the trial court improperly restricted his right to cross-examination, depriving him of his right to confront witnesses. The court held that the prisoner adduced prima facie evidence of the first two elements of his claim for legal malpractice, the existence of an attorney-client relationship and the attorney's wrongful act or omission. However, the court held that the prisoner failed to prove the third element of the claim, causation. The prisoner had to establish not only the defender's negligence, but also that there should have been a better result in the underlying lawsuit or matter. The claim concerning restriction of the prisoner's right to cross-examination was subject to review under the plain error standard or the Golding standard, and defendant failed to present sufficient evidence to meet either standard.

The tree warden stated that had he inspected the tree, he would have ordered it cut down because it presented a hazard. The court granted the tree warden's motion for summary judgment based on DeConti v. Clone, which ruled that the discretionary act of tree inspection did not fit within the exception to municipal employee immunity. The court also granted the property owner's motion for summary judgment, following the holding in Muratori, which provided that the legislative intent in Conn. Gen.

Lastly, the court denied summary judgment on the portions of the complaint alleging liability against the town under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-577n(a) because a jury could reasonably find that the public works director had a ministerial duty to contact the tree warden about the tree; thus, municipal immunity was not available to shield the town from trial on the allegations that the town, through its public works director, negligently failed to act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group properly intervened under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-19 to challenge environmental issues. The group and the owners challenged the commission's finding that the project met the requirements either for an RLCC under Regulations &sect; 7.1-1, or for a congregate/independent living facility (CILF) in Regulations &sect; 2. Alternatively, they claimed the regulations were impermissibly vague. They also argued that the commission failed to consider environmental impacts on wetlands, as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-19 and Regulations &sect; 8.3-8(C). The court found that substantial evidence supported a finding that the RLCC was a CILF. It met the affordability requirement of Regulations, &sect; 7.1-1, since the units' features minimized expenses of upgrading as aging residents' needs changed. The Regulations were not impermissibly vague merely for failing to separately define significant terms since the context of the terms and their ordinary definitions left little ambiguity. Finally, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-19's requirement that agencies consider environmental impacts did not expand the commission's jurisdictional limits, which, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2(a), did not include wetlands.</SPAN></P>

The inmate was later found with the vehicle and the victim's wallet. He filed a petition for habeas corpus after he was convicted of larceny and robbery. In denying the petition, the court determined that the inmate failed to establish that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because there was no showing that representation was deficient or that he was prejudiced. First, the record showed that the inmate's attorney properly investigated the fair market value of the stolen car. Next, there was no need for defense counsel to call a co-defendant to testify based on the fact that no favorable testimony would have been elicited. Further, defense counsel was able to exploit the absence of the witness to argue that the inmate was not responsible for the crime. The court also found that the stolen vehicle report would not have made a difference in the defense strategy. Moreover, it was evidence that was available at trial. As such, it was not newly discovered evidence to support a claim of actual innocence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had a history of severe asthma attacks. He was suffering from asthma and bronchitis and claimed that the night guard had been informed of his condition and advised that he might need medical assistance. The inmate suffered an attack and stopped breathing. His inmate came to his assistance and banged on the cell door, but because the guard was allegedly asleep, he did not come to the cell until 20 or 30 minutes later. The inmate claimed that the prison doctor failed to adjust his prescription medications or refill his inhalers. The inmate filed suit against defendants, but the court found that because the suit was against state employees in their official capacities and sought monetary damages, the doctrine of sovereign immunity applied; thus, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The court found also that because sovereign immunity applied, defendants did not need to demonstrate compliance with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165 or statutory immunity. The court found also that defendants' alleged conduct, deliberately falling asleep on the job and deliberately failing to provide medical care, could not reasonably be construed as reckless, wanton, or malicious conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developer filed an action for preliminary injunctive relief, permanent injunctive relief, and a declaratory judgment regarding the constitutionality of Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer's application for site plan approval of a shopping center was denied when the commission determined that the project was prohibited by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2k due to proximity to a lake. The developer appealed, contending that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2h(a) mandated that the application be decided based on zoning regulations in existence when the application was filed and that it complied with those regulations. The developer argued that application of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2k was constitutionally improper and that the commission improperly found that the nearby body of water was a lake and not a reservoir. The court found that the evidence before the commission conclusively showed that the body of water was a reservoir and that &sect; 8-2k specifically excluded reservoirs from its application. Having reached that conclusion, which disposed of the developer's prayer for relief, the court did not address the constitutional issues. Finally, a witness's uncontradicted testimony was that there was no way to place a monetary value on the loss occasioned by the commission's denial of the application under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2k, so injunctive relief was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supervisor refused to let the police officer work alone, showed up at her motor vehicle stops, removed the handcuffs from a suspect, publicly ridiculed her, ordered her to write up an incident report on a matter in which she had not been involved, falsely accused her of incompetence, refused to provide backup support, gave her undesirable beat assignments, and caused disciplinary action to be brought against her for a &quot;minor error&quot; in a police report. The police chief ordered the officer to appear at a meeting where she was ordered to &quot;beg&quot; for her job. After she did so, the university immediately fired her. The court found that when defendants made personnel decisions, they were not state actors. Consequently, the police officer failed to show a violation of &sect;&nbsp;1983. The supervisor's actions might have been mean spirited and overbearing, but they were not so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was convicted of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of Conn. Gen.

Stat. &sect; 46b-215c stated that liability for child support for parents incarcerated as a result of a criminal conviction was limited to the parent's actual daily income. The father did not work at the correctional facility and had no outside income, so his income was zero. The guardian ad litem for the child argued that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-215c should not apply because the legislature failed to consider circumstances wherein the child subject to the support order was also the victim of the crime, and also argued that equity should bar application of the statute in light of the father's reprehensible conduct. The court acknowledged the logic behind the arguments, but held that it could not deviate from the plain language of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-215c.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for manslaughter despite a claim that others committed the crime. After his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, he petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel. At the habeas trial, counsel testified that he did not want to bring in any evidence of the &quot;three Hispanic males with a gun,&quot; for fear of introducing evidence of a firearm at the scene of the crime that would be attributed to defendant. Despite this stated strategy, it was harmful to defendant and constituted inadequate representation to avoid introducing available and credible evidence of a clearly exculpatory nature in an ill-advised effort to avoid mentioning a firearm. This was especially true given the credibility of the four witnesses that counsel failed to call. All four individuals were law-abiding citizens, there was no meaningful impeachment of their testimony at the habeas trial, and none of the witnesses knew, or were in any way acquainted or associated with, defendant. Failure to pursue them in an attempt to exculpate defendant failed to provide defendant with the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. VI.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 53a-55(a)(1), which was a more serious crime than assault, would not be exposed to any mandatory minimum non-suspendable sentence and that the sentencing scheme therefore assigned a lesser penalty to a greater crime. The court held that there was ample scope for discovery of a rational basis for the different penalties for each offense. The legislature could have reasonably enacted this sentencing scheme: (1) to reduce the number of permanent and disabling or disfiguring injuries suffered by assault victims, (2) to deter the commission of serious assault offenses upon the belief that they were easier to commit and more frequently committed than homicide offenses, and (3) to deter serious assault offenses with a five-year mandatory sentence, upon the belief that a person convicted of manslaughter in the first degree would probably not in any event receive a sentence less than five years to serve.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 53a-193(13) definition of &quot;child pornography&quot; (before 2004 repeal and replacement) was overbroad and unconstitutionally vague facially and as applied to him because it could include computer-generated images.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for possession of child pornography after images of nude children in pictures that might or might not have been legally obscene if they had involved adults were seized from his computer. He argued that the statute as it then existed was overbroad and vague because it could conceivably have been used to prosecute him for possession of computer-generated images of children. The court disagreed. The definition of &quot;child pornography&quot; specifically referenced live performances to an audience, even if the audience consisted of one person. This requirement could only be satisfied if, at some point, a child had actually participated in a live performance during which the pictures were taken. Furthermore, any vagueness objections were addressed by the requirement that such possession be knowing. Defendant would be free to argue at trial that the pictures were in fact computer-generated, but that would be an issue for the fact-finder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Connecticut Department of Public Safety and two officers, filed a motion to dismiss the counts of plaintiff former employee's complaint that alleged termination for other than just cause in violation of the collective bargaining agreement, fraudulent misrepresentation in the collective bargaining agreement, and promissory estoppel based on representations allegedly made in connection with the collective bargaining agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee alleged a claim of constructive retaliatory discharge against the Department and officers. The Department and officers alleged that sovereign immunity barred the counts of the complaint that related to the collective bargaining agreement. To get around the hurdle of sovereign immunity, the employee had to allege conduct by the officers that was sufficiently egregious as to constitute conduct in excess of statutory authority. The three counts at issue were concerned with contract law. The employee did not allege that the Department and officers engaged in wrongful conduct in order to promote an illegal purpose, nor was there any specific statement that the actions of the Department and officers exceeded their statutory authority. Merely acting in a manner that was not in compliance with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement was insufficient to elevate a breach of that agreement into conduct that exceeded statutory authority in the manner that had the effect of waiving sovereign immunity. The employee failed to allege reckless, malicious, or wanton behavior under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165 as required to defeat sovereign immunity of the officials.</SPAN></P>

The DMR Commissioner filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was mentally retarded and received assistance from the DMR. The DMR Commissioner claimed immunity from inclusion in the action pursuant to the doctrine of sovereign immunity and that the court, therefore, lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The mother contended that as the DCF had the burden of providing services to her, and some of those services were then being provided by the DMR, then the DMR was a necessary party to the action. The court found that, pursuant to the principles that applied to the exception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity for actions where the Connecticut Legislature had waived the doctrine by force of necessary implication, the mother could circumvent the doctrine of sovereign immunity with respect to the State of Connecticut's obligation to provide her with services through the DCF and the DMR, in that the DCF could not assist the mother per its statutory mandate without the special input of the DMR.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A driver was attempting to turn into a driveway when the employee passed on the left and caused a collision. The insurer paid for the property damage to the vehicle and filed an action against the State and the employee to recover the amount expended. The employee's motion to dismiss was denied. The court determined that the employee was not protected by the common-law doctrine of sovereign immunity or statutory immunity under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165. As to the common-law immunity claim, the court examined the four-part test set forth in Spring to determine if the action was against the State. The court noted that the employee had been sued, the case concerned an accident that occurred during the scope of employment, the State was not the real party to the suit, and the state indemnification statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-141d(a), was not applicable. As to statutory immunity, the court held that the complaint properly alleged that the employee's actions were reckless due to the violation of quite a few traffic laws. Although the employee was responding to a burglary call, she was under a duty to warn other of a high speed approach under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-283.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner filed an action against the employees after the destruction of his dock was ordered. In granting their motion to dismiss, the court took judicial notice of the prior decisions affecting the case. Next, the court held the doctrine of sovereign immunity did not apply to some cases brought under Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11. However, the owner did not have a property right in the dock he was ordered to remove. Since that claim was dismissed, the court did not consider the Fifth Amendment claim. Also, the owner had no claims under equal protection, substantive due process, or Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 because there was no evidence that the employees acted unreasonably or irrationally; therefore, there was no selective enforcement. In addition, the record rebutted the owner's claim of a procedural due process violation since there was a contested evidentiary hearing and appellate review. The court found that there was no retaliation claim under the First Amendment because the actions of the employees were not motivated by the owner's prior complaint. Finally, the employees were entitled to immunity because they did not act in a wanton, reckless, or malicious manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought an action for visitation with a minor child pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-59. Plaintiff was not the child's biological father. Defendant, the mother of the child, moved to dismiss the action, asserting that plaintiff had not, and could not, meet the jurisdictional prerequisites for such an action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff began a relationship with the child when the child was four months old. The mother and plaintiff held themselves out to the community as a family, including the child, with the plaintiff being treated by the mother as the father of the child. Plaintiff provided substantial care for the child, including periods of sole responsibility for the child, and plaintiff and the mother had a son together. The court found that those allegations clearly articulated that plaintiff had a relationship similar in nature to a parent-child relationship. Moreover, plaintiff alleged that the child had been traumatized by the loss of a parental figure. The child's day care provider testified that the child was distressed and clinging to plaintiff after the separation of the parties, and a child psychologist testified that disruption of a nurturing, caretaking relationship placed a child at very serious risk for emotional and adjustment problems in the future, including coping problems, depression, and inability to relate to or create intimate relationships. The court found that real and significant harm would result should visitation be denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, for failure to file a timely notice of claim, plaintiff patient's action seeking recovery for malpractice that allegedly occurred when she was treated at the state university hospital. The State argued that 2003 Conn. Acts 17 (Spec. Sess.), a special act enacted to cure any timeliness problems, violated Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 as a public emolument for private benefit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to her complaint, the patient suffered brain damage and lost all kidney function because of a hospital staff physician's mistakes in a routine operation. The hospital did not reply promptly to her first requests for medical records after she began to suspect malpractice, so her notice of claim was not filed within the time limit provided by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-148(a). As that law permitted, she filed a late notice of claim after the legislature passed a special act based on its finding that allowing her to pursue her claim was equitable and also served the public interest. The court denied the motion to dismiss on two bases. First, it was not convinced that the notice of claim had in fact been filed late, given the operation of the delayed discovery rule. The patient and her attorney would not have been in any position to assess the likelihood of malpractice until her expert had a chance to examine her records, and the notice might well have been timely if those records had been promptly supplied. Secondly, the legislature had also considered the hospital's delay in finding that allowing a late filing would serve the public good as well as the patient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother received public assistance after the birth of her child. When paternity was established, the State sought child support. However, the father received supplement social security income (SSI) based on a disability. The evidence showed that the father had held several jobs before and after the child's birth. The State contended that the father should have been ordered to pay based on his earning capacity. The court determined that the father was not required to pay any support. Under Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 46b-215a-1(11)(B)(ii), SSI was wholly excluded as income for child support purposes. Further, the court was not allowed to impute income to the father based on his earning capacity under 2003 Conn. Acts 130 (Reg. Sess.). The court was precluded from considering earning capacity in computing arrearages as well since 2003 Conn. Acts 130 (Reg. Sess.) applied retrospectively. The court refused to find that 2003 Conn. Acts 130 (Reg. Sess.) was unconstitutionally discriminating against the mother. However, the court was not precluded from considering the actual earnings of the father in setting arrearages. The court entered an order based on the work performed since the birth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of a consent order with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, the town was required to undertake studies of its neighborhoods in order to determine which areas were not able to support on-site waste water treatment and would require the conveyance of waste water to an off-site facility for treatment and disposal. Among the areas identified by engineers hired by the town as possible sites were three parcels of land owned by the landowners. The town could not gain the landowners' permission to conduct the investigation and testing. The town brought two actions for an order permitting inspection and testing under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 48-13. The landowners objected under the takings clauses of U.S. Const. amend. V or Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, arguing they were entitled to compensation prior to the intrusion. The court found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 48-13 was constitutional on its face under the constitutional takings clauses. Moreover, it was constitutional as applied since the court would oversee the amount of intrusion, would provide compensation afterwards, and would insure against any U.S. Const. amend. IV intrusion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the town's motions, but limited the right of entry to 72 hours written notice and for the sole purpose of conducting minimally intrusive surveys, investigation, photography and the like. The court did not authorize the town to undertake borings or any more invasive activities, without first applying to the court for leave to do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Department of Environmental Protection (Connecticut) denied plaintiff property owner's request for permits to construct and operate a hot-mix asphalt plant. The owner filed suit, seeking a declaratory judgment that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-196, which limited the siting of asphalt plants, was illegally retroactive and unconstitutionally lacked a rational basis. The Department argued that the owner lacked standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department issued the owner a permit to construct a hot-mix asphalt plant and a conditional permit to operate it; both permits expired in one year. The owner did not complete construction within one year, and sought a one-year extension of the permits. The Department advised the owner that it could continue construction. Then, &sect; 22a-196 was enacted; it applied only to hot-mix asphalt plants not already in operation as of December 31, 1997. The Department found that the plant had not been completed by that date and was within one-third of a mile of a watercourse, in violation of &sect; 22a-196; therefore, the Department terminated the owner's construction permit. This suit followed. The Department argued that the owner lacked standing to challenge &sect; 22a-196 because, as its permit was no longer valid, it lacked a constitutionally-protected property interest. The court disagreed. The owner's interest in the use of its property had been sufficiently injured by the statute to confer classical standing. Whether it had a valid permit at the time of the statute's enactment was immaterial because standing to bring the action did not depend on possession of such a permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the owner had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially, the adjacent property owners' mailbox was located in the corner of the property owners' property, adjacent to the street line, opposite the location of the property owners' driveway. The adjacent property owners unilaterally moved their mailbox to the middle of the property owners' front yard, adjacent to the street line. The property owners requested that the adjacent property owners return the mailbox to its original location. The adjacent property owners refused. The property owners did not invoke any federal statute or regulation in their complaint. The court held that Congress intended that state law and regulations would concurrently apply to the issue of mailbox placement along rural routes. Compliance with both federal and state law was not a physical impossibility as the mailbox would be in compliance with federal regulations in its original location. There was nothing in the application of Connecticut's common law regarding property rights, injunctive relief, rights-of-way, and torts which presented an obstacle to the federal regulations regarding mailbox placement. Finally, the property owners were not required to exhaust any administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DCF alleged that the mother failed to achieve statutory rehabilitation. The court found that DCF made reasonable efforts to timely provide the mother with the necessary services to assist in reunification. The mother, however, was unwilling or unable to benefit from any of the reunification efforts made. The mother continually failed to cooperate or follow through with service providers who attempted to address her substance abuse and mental health issues, despite numerous referrals by DCF to a variety of different programs. Thus, the court concluded that DCF's efforts were thwarted by the mother's own behavior. As such, the mother's substance abuse issues continued to affect her ability to function on a personal and parenting level. While the children long maintained their affection for and ties to the mother, despite their removal from her care for more than three and a half years, the court found that it would be detrimental to them to be forced to experience any longer the uncertainty presented by the spectre that the mother may persist in the pattern of failing to achieve rehabilitation while remaining a focus of the children's unrealistic desire to return to her care.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's counsel moved for a competency hearing and thus, had the burden of proving incompetency. There was undisputed evidence that defendant was learning disabled and had great difficulty reading and writing. There was no evidence that defendant was presently mentally or medically ill. Defendant's claim of incompetency rested solely on the contention that he was moderately mentally retarded, and, as a result of his low level of intelligence, could not assist his counsel and/or understand the criminal proceedings pending against him. The main evidence defendant offered in support of his claim were IQ test results and the testing and opinions of a second doctor. However, defendant's cognitive test results and academic performance over an extended period of time prior to his graduation from high school, the transcripts of prior plea and sentencing hearings, and the credible testimony of law enforcement officials and others who observed and interacted with defendant all compelled the court to reject the psychological evidence presented by defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A young married couple were killed when the lights went out on their boat and it collided with another boat in the dark. Their administrators brought death actions against the engine manufacturer, a technology company, and the other boat owners and their boat manufacturer. The couple's two passengers brought personal injury actions against the couple's estate. All parties settled except the engine manufacturer, and the couple's suit against it proceeded under the theory of products liability. The jury awarded $ 130,000 to the husband's estate and $ 150,000 to the wife's estate. Including the settlements, the total award to the husband was $ 1,069,000 and the total award to the wife was $ 1,024,000. The court found that the verdicts were neither excessive nor shocking to the conscience of the community, noting that the decedents were young, healthy, happily married, and physically active with life expectancies of 50.1 years and 45.08 years. The court declined to increase the verdicts, noting that in light of the total awards, they were not inadequate and that the jury could have rejected the estimates of economic loss and the claim of conscious pain and suffering.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that respondent Connecticut Department of Correction incorrectly calculated his discharge date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2000, the inmate was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, execution suspended, and three years' probation. In 2001, he was sentenced in each of three cases to two years, to run concurrently, for a total effective sentence of two years. Later in 2001 his 2000 sentence was opened and he was re-sentenced to 23 months for a violation of probation stemming from the 2001 offenses. In 2003 he was sentenced on another case to two years, to run concurrent with the sentences then being served. He argued he was entitled to have the 2003 sentence deemed to have commenced the date the 2001 sentences were imposed. The court held that applying the inmate's reasoning would lead to the impossible scenario in which a defendant completed serving a sentence for an offense that had not yet been committed. Further, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-38(b), a sentence commenced when the prisoner was received in the custody to which he was sentenced. The 2003 sentence began to run when it was imposed -- in 2003. The inmate's claim was wholly without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-48 and 53a-134(a)(4), and two counts of burglary in the first degree, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-101(a)(2). Defendant moved to suppress pre-trial identifications made by eyewitnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the identifications were tainted by impermissibly suggestive police procedure, and were the result of a collaboration of the two witnesses or the result of one party assenting to the others identification rather than two separate independent and untainted identifications. The State conceded that the identification procedure, a one on one show-up, was presumptively suggestive. However, the appellate court held that under the totality of circumstances, the identifications of defendant were reliable. Both witnesses had seen defendant on at least one prior occasion and were familiar with his general physical characteristics. The home invasion robbery in question took place in a lighted kitchen area in close proximity to the victims over several minutes. Within several minutes of the assailants' departure, the witnesses were able to positively identify their assailants under the street lights, strobe lights from several police cars, and under a police spotlight. Finally, although one witness watched the other witness positively identify the three assailants there was no evidence that his identification was influenced by either the first witness or the police.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that a police officer conducted an illegal search in answering another individual's cellular telephone. The trial court held that defendant had a subjective expectation of privacy in that he was under the impression that he was speaking over the telephone with another individual, not a police officer. Defendant dialed a telephone number he presumably knew to be the individual's cellular telephone and was directly quoted as saying that he wanted to &quot;resupply&quot; the officer. The word &quot;resupply&quot; implied a previous dealing between the defendant and the individual. When defendant was arrested, he was alone, demonstrating an effort to maintain privacy on his end of the conversation. The officer conducted an illegal search when he answered the individual's cellular telephone without consent. As in other challenges that had been rejected, the State arranged to meet defendant personally via a telephone conversation, defendant spoke freely with strangers, and the officer did not affirmatively misrepresented his identity. Thus, defendant lacked standing to challenge the illegal search as he did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the telephone calls.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged a state employee sexually and physically abused him and that the State took no action to prevent this. The State claimed that he failed to allege exhaustion of administrative remedies by not stating in his complaint that he filed a claim with the Connecticut Claims Commissioner, that the Commissioner authorized suit, and the date of that authorization. The court agreed. Pursuant to &sect; 4-160, by failing to include that information in the complaint, the inmate failed to show that the State waived sovereign immunity; therefore, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. That he supplied evidence that he did in fact file a claim with the Commissioner was immaterial. And Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-592, the accidental failure of suit statute, did not authorize the court to disregard its lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court could not consider the inmate's motion to amend because it had to consider the jurisdictional issue first, and it determined that it lacked jurisdiction to proceed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, neighbors, appealed a decision by defendant, a city planning commission, which granted a special exception and the approval of a site plan to defendants, property owners, for the development of a funeral home building and related infrastructure which abutted the residential neighborhood in which the neighbors resided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The neighbors argued that the commission illegally created a new parking standard and illegally and arbitrarily applied that standard. The appellate court held that the town did not and was not required to establish a parking standard specific to funeral homes because it could reasonably be determined that funeral homes were sufficiently similar to the uses encompassed by an existing category. The parking standard for that category of uses contained clear criteria to guide the commission and to inform those affected of their rights and obligations. The commission's application of the seat-based standard to the funeral home constituted a reasonable interpretation of the existing regulations and was reasonably targeted to meet the normal parking needs of the facility. Therefore, the parking regulations were not impermissibly vague as applied to the funeral home and the commission's application of the regulations was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or illegal. The neighbors also argued that the funeral home was fundamentally incompatible with the neighborhood business zone. The appellate court held that the commission was within its rights in arriving at this discretionary decision.</SPAN></P>

His conviction was affirmed on appeal. Thereafter, the inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, raising issues as to the effectiveness of his trial and appellate counsel. In denying the petition, the court held: (1) that the inmate was not deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of trial counsel by the fact that his counsel decided not to call a psychiatrist to testify at the sentencing hearing because numerous details of the inmate's heinous conduct on the night of the murder would have come into evidence, thereby helping to establish an aggravating factor; (2) that there was no showing that the trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by his &quot;ethical lapses&quot; where the actions of the trial counsel inured to the benefit of the inmate; and (3) that the inmate's appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the state's death penalty statute because there was no legal basis for such a challenge on the direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Connecticut Commissioner of Public Health and the Connecticut Attorney General, moved to strike a complaint filed by plaintiff restaurant and cafe owners and operators serving liquor (collectively restaurants) seeking a declaratory judgment that 2003 Conn. Pub. Acts 45 violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 and seeking an injunction prohibiting its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurants serving liquor argued that the ban on environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) violated the equal protection laws as it exempted private clubs and casinos. The trial court assumed that the restaurants had been deprived of substantial business due to the ban, while the exempt businesses had not been harmed. The statute was passed with an objective of protecting and promoting the public health from ETS. There was no fundamental right to smoke and smokers were not a suspect class. Thus, the rational basis test was applied. As it was uncontested that ETS presented serious health risks to those exposed to it, there was a rational basis for the ban. The fact that private clubs were private provided a rational basis for treating them differently. Assuming that the State had the authority to apply the ban to the tribal land on which the casinos were located, the State's concerns over its ability to enforce the smoking ban at casinos provided a rational basis to exempt the casinos. Any political and economic influence of the casinos did not alter the legal analysis. The equal protection claims were without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The requests for a declaratory judgment and for injunctive relief were denied. Defendants' motion to strike was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner sought consolidated review of a decision of defendant zoning commission denying approval of two coastal area management site plans filed regarding, inter alia, development of additional parking spaces, pursuant to an easement, on property owned by intervening defendant neighbor. The neighbor challenged the owner's standing to apply for approval regarding its property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner and the neighbor owned adjoining properties along the waterfront. The owner's property was benefited by an easement allowing it to develop parking spaces on the neighbor's property if needed to comply with zoning regulations. The owner's development plan, involving an increased number of boat slips, also created a need for additional parking spaces. The neighbor resisted such activity on its property, but the court held that ownership of the easement interest gave the owner standing as a person aggrieved to appeal the commission's action and that with proper approval, its proposed activity could have been permissible both under the grant made in a recorded easement and under local zoning regulations generally. Nonetheless, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-109 authorized a local zoning commission to deny approval to proposed uses that would violate the policies of planned coastal management, and substantial evidence supported the commission's finding that development under the proposed plans, and particularly the addition of parking spaces, would put a huge strain on the need to provide for water dependent uses, justifying denial of permission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partnership owned a parcel of land in a business zone, as well as a perpetual easement of an abutting parcel that was used for a parking lot. As the properties involved were within the Coastal Zone, the partnership filed two coastal area management site plans with the Commission in its efforts to add 10 docking slips to its own property, and to add additional parking to the easement area. The Commission denied the applications, and the partnership filed a timely appeal as well as additional site plan applications. The additional applications were also denied, and on appeal, the court initially found that the partnership was an aggrieved party for purposes of standing to bring the appeal. Thereafter, the court determined that the partnership complied with the applicable municipal regulations involving both properties. The court reviewed the record and determined that substantial evidence supported the Commission's finding that the proposal would have an adverse impact on water-dependent uses, and that the adverse impact had not been mitigated. Further, construction of a single-family home would impact public access. Accordingly, denial of the applications was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trustees and the interest holders in property (collectively, trustees) filed suit against defendants, a the town and its board of assessment appeals (collectively, town). The town filed a motion to strike the count of the complaint alleging violations of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-62a and 12-63, for which the trustees sought an injunction requiring the town to conduct a reassessment of all real property in the town and punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees did not plead a statutory basis for their suit. The appellate court held that the trustees alleged sufficient facts to assert a cause of action under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-119 despite their failure to specifically identify the statute. The trustees alleged that the assessment of their property was grossly excessive, that the town was required to assess the property at 70 percent of its actual valuation, and that the town exceeded that percentage. Further, the trustees sufficiently alleged that the town violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-62a and 12-63. The trustees could seek injunctive relief as they were not seeking to enjoin the collection of taxes, but to reassess all properties in the town in a uniform manner and at the mandated percentages. However, the trustees failed to give notice of the suit to the other property owners in town and their claim for injunctive relief was stricken. Finally, the prayer for punitive damages was stricken as the trustees were not entitled to punitive damages under any of the statutes governing tax appeals and they did not allege that the town acted in a wanton or wilful malicious way.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to strike the count of the complaint alleging a violation of the tax assessment statutes, for which the trustees sought an injunctive order requiring the town to conduct a new revaluation of all real property in the town, was granted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its action alleging defendant debtor defaulted on a promissory note, plaintiff state university filed a motion to dismiss, under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect;&sect; 10-30, -31, the debtor's counterclaim that the university violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1692 (2004), and that the university's actions damaged the debtor's credit rating, thus justifying dismissal of the action and damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university commenced an action against the debtor, alleging default on a promissory note and unjust enrichment arising from the debtor's non-payment of a debt. The debtor alleged that the university did not credit her for numerous payments and refused to accept her tendered satisfaction of the debt. In a cross-complaint, the debtor sought dismissal, monetary damages, and equitable relief based on the university's alleged violation of the FDCPA. The university moved to dismiss the counterclaims, arguing that, as an agent of the state, sovereign immunity protected it, especially where the debtor did not follow the procedures in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-141 et seq., for bringing a monetary claim against a state agent. The court found that, by initiating the action, the university voluntarily invoked the court's jurisdiction and subjected itself to any proper cross-claim arising out of the subject matter of its action. Thus, the university waived sovereign immunity with regard to the debtor's counterclaim, which clearly arose from enforcement of the promissory note. Moreover, once the university consented to the counterclaim by bringing suit, the statutory procedure was not required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the university's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the mother and the ex-husband's divorce, the fiancee, among other claims, contended that the mother, assisted by the grandmother, directed the mother and the ex-husband's minor child to make allegations of sexual abuse by the ex-husband and the fiancee. These allegations led to the fiancee's arrest on criminal charges. Defendants contended that, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-1k, they were crime victims, as members of the minor child's immediate family, and that a stay under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-235e was appropriate. The fiancee argued that since there had been no adjudication of the allegations against her in the criminal proceeding, there was no &quot;crime victim&quot; under &sect; 52-235e. The court found the language of &sect; 52-235e made it clear that the legislature did not require a stay only after an adjudication in the underlying criminal proceeding. By liberally construing &sect; 52-235e, the grandmother was a &quot;crime victim&quot; under &sect; 52-235e, as a member of the minor child's &quot;immediate family.&quot; The fiancee's allegations directly implicated the grandmother in the events leading to the fiancee's arrest, and under the circumstances &sect; 52-235e's protection should to be available to her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hospital filed motions to dismiss portions of plaintiff patients' complaint and to strike all 15 of the counts in the complaint. The complaint alleged that the hospital violated statutory provisions governing the patients' right to obtain bed funds under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19a-509b (2003), which would have entitled them to free hospitalization and medical care, and that the hospital engaged in unlawful collection activities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patients claimed that the hospital failed to provide them with adequate notice of bed funds that would have provided them with free medical care.

Stat. &sect; 42-110a, and the collecting at cost statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat, &sect; 19a-673(b), along with counts based on common law. The court denied the hospital's dismissal motion because the patients demonstrated standing to enforce the bed funds statute. That statute implied a private right of action and the patients were aggrieved. The finding of standing defeated the motion to dismiss. The CUTPA claim was properly pled. The patients' could reopen judgments obtained against them for not paying their bills after the four month period in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-212a because they alleged CUTPA violations. Moreover, the patients properly pled violations of the bed funds statute. However, because the hospital billed them, but had not begun collection, the collecting at cost statute was inapplicable. Finally, the court summarily found that the common law claims were not sufficiently pled.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8, from a decision of by defendant city planning and zoning commission, which denied plaintiffs' application for a zone change pursuant to Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner and the lessee applied for a zone change from residential to light industrial in order to reflect the historic use of their properties as a storage yard for contractor materials and equipment. The commission denied the application on the grounds that the proposed change did not comply with either the master or comprehensive city plan, it was spot zoning, the predominant use in the area was residential, and the change would create a nonconformity by placing existing residential uses in an industrial zone. The owner and the lessee appealed, arguing the evidence did not support the commission's grounds for denying their application. The lessee separately alleged that denial of the application resulted in a practical confiscation of its leased property. The court found that the city's plans encouraged stability and preservation of residential neighborhoods, so sufficient evidence supported the decision. Also, the lessee likely did not have standing to bring an inverse condemnation claim because that right existed in the property owner. Nevertheless, the lessee did not meet its burden of showing that the decision did not allow any reasonable alternative use of the property.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-217. Accordingly, he claimed that the charge should be dismissed because he has not committed an offense. The court found that the replica antique pistol allegedly possessed by defendant was fired, and that it propelled via gun powder a shot that mortally wounded the defendant's spouse. Accordingly, the court found that the gun in question was a pistol, revolver or other weapon from which a shot could be discharged, as defined by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-3(19). The court further found that, contrary to defendant's contention, it was not likely that the general assembly intended to create an exception to the criminal possession statute that would permit serious offenders to arm themselves with large-caliber, multiple-shot, operational replica antique pistols.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city entered into a written contract with a collection company by which the company was to provide services to the city for the collection of delinquent real estate taxes. Under the agreement, the company was paid by the city a servicing fee of 15 percent of the amount actually collected. The fee was a contingency fee in that it was only paid by the city to the company if the company was successful in collecting the arrearage. The taxpayers sought a temporary injunction, contending that a collection fee of a fixed percentage was not authorized by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-166 and that such a fee was unreasonable because it was not based on the amount of work performed by the company. The court disagreed, finding that &sect; 12-166 provided for a collection fee and that the fee was reasonable because it was a contingency fee and as such there was a risk of no recovery; therefore, the company was allowed to charge a premium for its services in return for assuming those risks. Lastly, the court found that it was sufficient to sustain the constitutionality of the delegation of authority contained in &sect; 12-166 that the court had implied a standard that tax collection fees be reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the prosecution of him for the offense of manslaughter in the first degree under the facts and circumstances of the case was a violation of due process of law because, under the facts, a reasonable person would not be put on notice that such conduct would be a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-55(a)(3). The court disagreed, noting, contrary to defendant's contention, judicial precedent established otherwise. Among other things, the court noted that defendant was operating his vehicle at a high rate of speed at the time of the accident, that he did not attempt to negotiate the curve in the road, and that he had a blood alcohol level of 0.240. In addition, defendant told the officers that he had been drinking in an area several miles from the site of the accident. Defendant also argued that his prosecution was violative of his rights to equal protection under the state and federal constitutions. The court found no violation as defendant failed to demonstrate that he was similarly situated to defendants in the cases cited in his brief who were charged only with a lesser offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client was arrested on a warrant charging him with first-degree robbery for an alleged knife point robbery. The victim had complained that she was robbed by a &quot;light skinned&quot; black male. The public defender's office lawyer represented the client, who had been arrested three times previously, was on probation, and had a prior conviction for failure to appear in court. The client was held in custody awaiting trial on a $ 50,000 bond and was released nine months later when, during jury selection, the victim had an opportunity to view the client and told the prosecutor that he was not the perpetrator. The client sued defendants, and the court ruled in favor of defendants, finding that due to the client's previous arrests and conviction for failing to appear in court, the lawyer's failure to seek a bond reduction was reasonably prudent and in no way an act of malpractice. The court found also that because the victim had selected the client's photo as the perpetrator, and pointed to photos of what she thought was &quot;light skinned&quot; that were close to the client's skin tone, the lawyer's strategy of opposing a voluntary lineup prior to trial to avoid re-identification was sound.</SPAN></P>

Prior to that application, the local conservation commission had filed an application necessitated by the existence of wetlands on the developer's property. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) made a tentative decision to approve the wetlands application. Based on the DEP's decision, the PZC denied the developer's subdivision application. The developer appealed. The court found that since there was no application before the conservation commission, the DEP had issued only a tentative, and not a final, decision, and that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-26 explicitly stated that the PZC could not render a decision until the DEP submitted a report with its final decision. Since there was no dispute that the application was no longer before the conservation commission and that the DEP's decision was tentative and not final, the PZC's action was seriously flawed and the developer's appeal was sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant claimed to have suffered keratitis to both eyes, which was caused by the landlord's breach of certain provisions of the lease and the landlord's negligence relating to the property. In the CUTPA claim, the tenant argued that the alleged contractual breaches and negligence of the landlord constituted unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110b, and caused the tenant to suffer an ascertainable loss of money or property. The estate argued that the CUTPA action did not survive the death of the landlord under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-599, the survival of action statute. The court found that because CUTPA was a remedial, not a penal, statute, such an action survived the death of the landlord pursuant to the survival statute. However, the court held that the tenant had not pled any facts that would support a CUTPA violation based on the landlord's alleged breaches of the lease. Particularly, the tenant failed to set forth any facts showing any aggravating factors, such as acts of misrepresentations or deceptions of the landlord.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(k)(2) stated that a court had to allow any party to introduce evidence in addition to the contents of the records if it appeared additional testimony was necessary for an equitable disposition of the appeal. The court found that where it was claimed that a re-zoning constituted a taking of property without just compensation in violation of the federal and state constitutions, additional evidence was necessary because an inverse condemnation could not be raised before a commission until the zoning revision was adopted. Thus, the court concluded that the property owner should be allowed to introduce additional evidence regarding (1) zoning comparisons from other towns relating to open space, set back, and height requirements, (2) testimony from an appraiser or land use planner relative to open space, set back, height requirements and devaluation of the property, (3) testimony, reports, and maps, but only to the extent that this evidence supported the allegation that the open space requirement of the zoning change constituted an unlawful taking in violation of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an enhanced sentence of 10 years, imposed upon him pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-40b by a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Conn. Gen. Book, R. Super Ct. &sect; 43-22.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to his conviction, defendant had been convicted of many relatively minor crimes over the course of 15 years, and he was also accused at his sentencing hearing of committing numerous crimes while released on bond and while on trial. The trial judge exercised his discretion and sentenced him to serve 15 years of a possible 21 year term, based upon charges for which he was either convicted or pleaded guilty. Defendant disputed that his plea was fully understood and voluntary at the time of his canvass on the second-part charges. However, the claims presented in defendant's case were distinguishable from the constitutional claims involving double jeopardy, as well as the areas of jurisdiction that authorized the trial court to correct an illegal sentence. Where defendant claimed an Apprendi violation since there was no jury trial on the facts that gave rise to his enhanced sentence, accurate information regarding the predicate charges was before the court through the second part of the information, and defendant admitted the facts attendant to that information when he pleaded guilty and was canvassed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailer sought to transform the existing 35,000-square-foot supermarket into a 55,700-square-foot World Class Market. This expansion would increase the shopping center's footprint from roughly 153,000 to 167,700 square feet and, therefore, required a special permit under Guilford, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 273-128L. Among other errors, the adjoining owners argued that the proposed building violated the zone's maximum expansion regulation. To apply, Guilford, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 273-131 required a building that existed as of its effective date and that the building be non-conforming under the regulations with respect to maximum building size, maximum coverage, or maximum floor area. If those two requirements were satisfied, the building could expand by special permit only, and that expansion could not exceed five percent of the building's total floor area. The court found that the shopping center in question met the two standards. Furthermore, the court found that the proposed expansion exceeded the permissible five percent. Therefore, the court held that the commission erred in granting the variance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff congressional candidate sought an injunction to compel defendant Connecticut State Elections Enforcement Commission to recertify her as a primary candidate, arguing that the commission's actions violated her due process rights and required protection under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1988.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate's brother circulated petitions on behalf of her primary candidacy. He forgot that he had lived outside the district briefly and had to re-register as a local party member before his involvement would be legal under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-410. Although he registered as soon as he realized his mistake, the signatures had been gathered and it was too late. The court considered the Commission's argument that the candidate lacked standing to seek expedited action under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-329a, and it decided that while she probably lacked standing under that provision, it was not clear that she was seeking relief thereunder. It therefore went on to consider whether she had met the test for entitlement to preliminary injunctive relief. Since Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-410 was a regulatory scheme designed to preserve the good order of elections, the burden was on the candidate to show likelihood of success on the merits. The candidate had not met that burden, particularly since she had not made a constitutional challenge to that statute in her pleadings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was ordered to cease and desist the use of his rights of way because they were established in violation of New Haven, Conn. Zoning Ordinance &sect; 12 B.2(c). Specifically, the order recited that the establishment of rights of way without a special exception in the residential was a violation of the zoning ordinance. The owner contended that under the circumstances a special exception was unnecessary and &sect;12.B.2.(c) was inapplicable in that that provision only regulates non-residential uses. The use of the subject rights of way was entirely residential. Counsel for the owner wrote a fairly lengthy and quite articulate letter to the chairman of the board prior to the hearing date. The letter was read into the record by counsel at the request of the chairman and fully set forth the background regarding the easements and the owner's position. There was nothing to prevent the presentation of that evidence at the hearing before the board. The additional evidence would not have been admissible under one of the &quot;as of right&quot; categories previously discussed by the court.</SPAN></P>

The owners requested review. The commission moved to strike the owners' two counts for declaratory judgments, asking the court to declare certain of the criteria utilized by the commission to be fundamentally unfair, unduly vague, and unconstitutional, both facially and as applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission contended that the administrative appeal could not be joined in the same action with claims for declaratory judgments, as they would have had the effect of declaring the very regulations under which the owners had brought their requests to the commission to be unconstitutional. The court noted, however, that the rule had been relaxed in Connecticut in the interests of alternative pleading and in the interests of judicial economy. Therefore, the court allowed the owners' declaratory judgment counts (regarding the constitutionality of the land use regulations) to remain. The court's decision was based in part upon the owners having followed the notice provisions applicable to declaratory judgment proceedings, such that all potentially interested property owners had been notified. The court also noted a recent case that stated the constitutionality attack constituted the kind of general attack upon land use regulations that it indicated were to be the subject of a declaratory judgment action rather than an appeal from the denial of an application submitted pursuant to the land use regulations.</SPAN></P>

She alleged that he struck her in the vagina with an iron and that he violated her vagina with a sexual aid. Defendant was convicted. He then sought a judgment of acquittal or a new trial. The court denied his motions, finding that the medical evidence from the doctor who examined the victim and a DNA expert who examined the sexual aid supported the jury's verdicts. The court also found that Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchaser's claims arose from using a heating pad that the manufacturer had made and which was sold by the retailer. The special defenses alleged that (1) the purchaser's allegations claiming recklessness failed to state a cause of action on which relief could be granted; (2) her action was barred by the doctrine of laches, and (3) her punitive damages claims were unconstitutional because they violated the right to equal protection. The court found that, as to the first special defense, the manufacturer and the retailer improperly challenged the recklessness cause of action with a special defense deficient in supporting fact. Further, as to the second special defense, although the purchaser requested relief in equity, the nature of the action in the alleged counts sounded in product liability and recklessness as an action at law, and as such, the statute of limitations in the applicable statutes applied to the exclusion of the equitable doctrine of laches. Finally, the manufacturer and the retailer limited their third special defense to constitutional grounds, and the purchaser demonstrated that punitive damages were constitutional in actions for product liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The counts that were the subject of the motion to strike alleged causes of action for res ipsa loquitur, constitutional violations under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and counts pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 10-235 and -240. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city on several counts, including the count under &sect; 10-240. As to the remaining counts sought to be stricken, the court noted that res ipsa loquitur was a doctrine of evidence and not a cause of action distinct from a claim of negligence. Accordingly, the claims of negligence already pleaded against each defendant made the res ipsa loquitur claims duplicative, as well as procedurally improper. The court found that the claim against the teacher under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was proper, as the facts were sufficient to support an abuse of power that was &quot;literally shocking to the conscience.&quot; However, the claim was insufficient as to the other defendants, as there was no basis to show an equal rights violation or that those defendants condoned such actions. The claim pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-235 was stricken against the board, as there was no statutory direct action available thereunder for prospective plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother conceded that the father was incarcerated and that the magistrate was bound by the Act to eliminate the father's child support obligation. The appellate court held that the mother properly raised her constitutional challenge to the Act for the first time on appeal, as a magistrate could not rule on the constitutionality of a statute. The Act did not violate the separation of powers doctrine, as child support guidelines legislation was not under judicial control. The statute also did not violate the Due Process Clause. The legislature provided constitutionally adequate process by enacting the statute, publishing it, and affording those within the statute's reach a reasonable opportunity both to familiarize themselves with and to comply with the Act's requirements. Further, a procedural due process challenge had to be evaluated in context, and there was no indication that the father owned anything of value. Finally, the mother did not belong to a suspect class and did not allege the impairment of a fundamental constitutional right. The mother failed to show that the statute was arbitrary or had no rational basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, employees of the Connecticut Department of Banking, filed a motion for summary judgment in an action by plaintiffs, a consumer debt adjustment company and its president, which alleged violations of plaintiffs' First Amendment and equal protection rights in an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Some of the counts in the 12-count complaint had been previously dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was regulated by the Department. One of the employees conducted a routine unannounced audit, which the president indicated was at a very busy time. Nonetheless, he cooperated until the employee engaged in an elaborate delaying ritual, which caused the president to become frustrated and he asked the employee to leave. This led to the president writing a long email to another employee, which resulted in multiple investigations and threats of regulatory reprisals. Plaintiffs brought the instant action. Claims against one Department official were dismissed due to immunity, and claims by the president were dismissed due to lack of standing. Defendants sought summary judgment on the remaining claims. The court found that the company had committed violations of the banking laws, which formed the basis of the employees' actions in conducting an investigation, imposing a penalty, and revoking its license. The Department's actions were objectively reasonable, and the company failed to show, for purposes of overcoming the qualified immunity, that the employees acted on an improper motive. Nor was there any connection between the protected speech and the employees' actions.</SPAN></P>

Ct. &sect; 17-4 and to enter the same judgment as previously entered, except it requested that the judgment be entered on the correct docket number. Defendant, filing a motion to dismiss, claimed that the error deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect of assault. He was committed to the jurisdiction of the Connecticut Commissioner of Mental Health for 20 years. The maximum term of commitment expired on May 1, 1995. In a later case, defendant was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect of murder. He was committed to the Commissioner for a period of time not to exceed 25 years. Defendant's maximum term of commitment had an expiration date of January 24, 2004. As defendant's release date in the murder case approached, the State petitioned for continued commitment beyond the release date. The State inadvertently filed the petition under the docket number for the assault file. The defect was a circumstantial defect that, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-123, did not abate the pleadings or deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. Defendant was aware that the file at issue was the murder file. The murder file was the only one of the two files over which the trial court retained jurisdiction. Furthermore, the parties understood during every aspect of the proceeding that the proceeding pertained solely to the murder file.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's motion to reopen judgment was granted. The orders of the trial court on December 23, 2003, stood, and the orders were applied to the correct docket number.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants for the entry-level firefighter position completed their application and were eligible for hire. Based on their test performance, they were ranked on a hiring list. The court considered an order to show cause as to why a preliminary injunction should not issue, restraining the commission from hiring candidates pursuant to the existing rank order list. Defendants sought dismissal, alleging that the applicants had not exhausted their administrative remedies and accordingly, that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The court analyzed relevant portions of the city charter and determined that the claims all involved the administrative work of the personnel department under Bridgeport, Conn., Charter &sect; 206(a)(4). Accordingly, the applicants should have exhausted their administrative rights to appeal before seeking judicial intervention. There was no due process violation caused by vagueness, as they had fair warning of their right to appeal to the commission. Their claim of a violation of the Freedom of Information Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-200 et seq., also was barred by a failure to exhaust the administrative remedy available to them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the complaint as to all applicants except one who had administratively appealed. As to that applicant, the court treated the motion to dismiss as a motion to strike and granted that motion. The court denied the application for temporary injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed from a decision of defendant town planning and zoning commission (Connecticut), which granted a neighboring property owner's application for a zone change and which also approved certain amendments to the zoning regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court initially determined that the property owners were statutorily aggrieved pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(a)(1). The neighbor was granted a zone change and an amendment to the town zoning regulations in order to create a seaside preservation zoning district and to provide regulations for such district. The court found that the regulations were reasonably precise and adequate to give affected parties notice of their rights and obligations. Further, both the change and the amendments were found to be consistent with the comprehensive plan and reasonably related to the police power purposes found in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2. Accordingly, the zone change was not spot zoning, nor would it disturb the tenor of the neighborhood. Rather, the zoning amendment was tied directly to the existing regulations which made up the comprehensive plan. The zone change furthered the preservation of historic properties and assured waterfront access to the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ZEO made a CDO requiring the landowner to remove some of her 14 pet dogs because she was not in compliance with the town's zoning regulations regarding the operation of a kennel. The landowner denied she operated a kennel and she challenged the CDO, but the board upheld it on a finding that the landowner was not in compliance with an allowed accessory use of being able to keep four or fewer dogs on the property. The landowner appealed, primarily arguing that the board acted in an ultra vires manner when it voted to uphold the CDO because there was no numerical limit in the zoning regulations on the keeping of dogs as household pets. The landowner further claimed that the board could not uphold a zoning commission's resolution that defined the keeping of four or fewer pet dogs as an allowed accessory use because that was an impermissible attempt to adopt a zoning regulation. The court found that the board acted in an ultra vires way by making a decision predicated on a commission resolution that was adopted without adherence to notice and public hearing requirements of Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's predecessor in interest entered into two leases with the State. The landowner alleged that the State failed to pay additional rent under real estate tax escalation clauses in the two leases. The Office of the Connecticut Claims Commissioner denied the landowner permission to sue the State because the lease clauses concerning additional rent for tax increases were invalid, as they were never approved by the Connecticut State Properties Review Board. The court found that the property interest asserted by the landowner was a rent escalation clause that was declared illegal and unenforceable by the Claims Commissioner. The landowner could have returned to the State Properties Review Board to have the modification in the lease approved. After the Claims Commissioner invalidated the escalation clause in the leases, the landowner could have sought assistance at the Connecticut General Assembly. However, the landowner did neither. The court did not consider the invalid lease term to be property within the meaning of the proprietary protections afforded by the State and Federal Constitutions. Therefore, the case was barred by sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner filed a declaratory judgment action against defendants, a town and its planning and zoning commission, alleging that the commission lacked the authority to compel him to contribute to the town sidewalk fund, that the town had been unjustly enriched, and that Watertown, Conn., Subdivision Regs. &sect; 5.4 violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-25 and was unconstitutional. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several years before the owner filed suit, the commission approved the owner's application to construct a subdivision subject to the condition that he contribute to the town's sidewalk fund in lieu of constructing sidewalks. The owner paid in full but brought this action after the commission amended Watertown, Conn., Subdivision Regs. &sect; 5.4 four years later to specifically authorize such a contribution. Dismissing only the first two counts, the court held that (1) the owner could not collaterally attack the commission's decision because the condition did not violate public policy as it ceased to exist once the owner made the contribution and because the commission's lack of jurisdiction was not &quot;entirely obvious,&quot; the owner had the opportunity to challenge commission's jurisdiction at the time, and the commission's conduct was not so far outside what could have been regarded as a valid exercise of its power; but (2) the owner satisfied the conditions necessary to challenge the constitutionality of the amended regulation because he satisfied the classical aggrievement test and all other conditions necessary to maintain an action under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 17-55.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendants' motion to dismiss the count challenging the constitutionality of the town's amended subdivision regulation, but it granted the motion to dismiss the owners' collateral attacks on the initial condition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The businessman argued that the ordinance was void as it made violation of the ordinance subject to sanctions more severe than allowed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-148(c)(10)(A). The trial court held that the suit was capable of resolution without passing upon the ordinance's constitutionality. Berlin, Conn., Municipal Code &sect; 14-243 provided the penalty for violation of the ordinances on sexually oriented businesses. The trial court was unable to find authority that granted the town the power to arrest an individual and charge him with a misdemeanor for violating the sexually oriented businesses ordinance. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-148(c) did not grant such power. Although the town did not have the power to charge those violating the ordinance with a misdemeanor, the entire ordinance was not invalid. The trial court's power to sever was an inherent judicial power. There was no indication that the town intended the misdemeanor provision to be unseverable, and Berlin, Conn., Municipal Code &sect; 1-13 showed that the town preferred severance in the event of a successful legal challenge. The portion of the ordinance enabling a misdemeanor arrest for a violation of its provisions was ultra vires.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a proposed plan to convert defendant mutual savings bank (MSB) to a capital stock bank under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 36a-136, plaintiff depositors sued the MSB, directors, and corporators, for fiduciary duty and contract breaches, tortious interference, and violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110a et seq. Defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two similar putative class action suits were consolidated to decide motions to dismiss. The court, in granting the motions, decided that the depositors had not exhausted their Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 36a-136 administrative remedies with the banking department (BD) to contest the plan, which the BD had conditionally approved, to determine if it was &quot;fair to depositors&quot; under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 36a-136(j), primarily by not using the BD's Conn. Regs., Conn. State Agencies &sect; 36-1-46 declaratory judgment procedures. Those procedures clearly were available to the depositors, and had been adopted by the BD under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-176(b) for use by &quot;any person&quot; under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-176(a) and &quot;any interested person&quot; under Conn. Regs., Conn. State Agencies 36-1-46. The depositors essentially alleged that the 1838-created MSB's equity was owned by all depositors and that the plan was fundamentally unfair to them as it enriched and entrenched defendants and MSB management at depositor expense without fair, adequate, and full compensation. That was essentially the same, not a different and separately justiciable, &quot;fairness&quot; issue the BD was first to decide under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 36a-136.</SPAN></P>

The board and the purchaser argued the neighbor could not appeal because he was not an owner of adjoining land and was not an &quot;aggrieved person&quot; under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(a)(1). The court found that the neighbor's fiduciary deed was sufficient to convey good title to the neighbor, and the neighbor's land abutted the purchaser's lot, so he was statutorily aggrieved under &sect; 8-8(a)(1) and could prosecute the appeal. The court next found that the purchaser did not meet the burden of proof required for a variance. The purchaser failed to show that strict application of the town's zoning regulation produced an unusual hardship simply because he could not convert the property into the use he wanted. Moreover, the purchaser failed to show that the requested variance would not substantially affect the town's comprehensive zoning plan. Therefore, the board exceeded its authority by granting the variance after the purchaser wholly failed to meet either of the conditions required for a variance.</SPAN></P>

The executrix moved to strike any apportionment claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two of the federal healthcare providers had argued they were federal employees under the Federally Supported Health Centers Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 233, and had removed the case to federal district court which then substituted the United States as a defendant, thus essentially dismissing the claims against them. The district court then dismissed the case against the United States for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2671 et seq. The state court held that for the first 120 days after the return date, the individual federal providers were parties to the action, thus Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-102b(a) was inapplicable. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-102b(c) was inapplicable because the executrix did not settle or release the federal providers as they were dismissed. Thus, the federal providers were no longer parties. There was no statutory authority for the apportionment claims. The federal providers were immune from liability in the state court and, pursuant to &sect; 52-102b(c), could not become apportionment defendants. In any case, sovereign immunity shielded the United States and its employees from suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of committing a triple homicide, which was considered especially horrific because two of the victims were children. The State sought to have the death penalty imposed on defendant. In response, defendant filed a motion to preclude a capital penalty hearing. He argued in support of that motion that the Connecticut capital felony sentencing statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-46a, was unconstitutional on a number of grounds. After considering his motion, the trial court found it had to be denied. The trial court so concluded because it found that all of the grounds defendant asserted had been rejected by either the United States Supreme Court or the Connecticut Supreme Court. Indeed, it noted that the Connecticut Supreme Court had recently upheld the constitutionality of that statute. Defendant conceded that his arguments were not persuasive and informed the trial court that the arguments were made to preserve the issues in question for reviewing courts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners argued the matter was moot because no actual controversy existed after they obtained the zoning permit, and, by extension, that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Further, they claimed the fact that the officer still sought attorney fees and costs did not prevent the matter from being rendered moot. The court found the officer met her burden of proving the court had subject matter jurisdiction, as an actual controversy remained regarding damages; the court could still grant the officer practical relief in the form of costs and attorneys fees pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-12. In addition, the doctrine of the law of the case supported this conclusion. The court had previously denied the homeowners' summary judgment motion and held the matter was not moot. Therefore, the court denied the homeowners' motion to dismiss, as they relied on the same grounds and no new circumstances had arisen. Because the court previously ordered the homeowners to obtain a zoning permit and they subsequently complied, the question of the special defenses' legal sufficiency was moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A supermarket applied to defendant zoning commission for site plan approval and a special permit with respect to its property. The zoning commission approved the special permit and site plan, and plaintiff property owners appealed the decision. The commission filed a motion to dismiss the appeal under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 10-31(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supermarket's proposal requested permission to add to and expand a pre-existing retail store with associated changes to parking areas and landscaping. The zoning commission approved the special permit and site plan subject to certain conditions. The owners claimed that the supermarket's proposal did not conform to the town's zoning regulations and the commission added conditions which it intended to delegate to other agencies. In its motion to dismiss, the commission argued that the owners were collaterally estopped based on a final decision in an earlier appeal by the owners. The court found that the collateral estoppel claim only applied to one paragraph of the owners former complaint. Also, one of the owners was not a plaintiff in the former action. Consequently, there was no justification for dismissing her as a plaintiff. Further, in the commission's other arguments as to standing, the court found that they were intertwined with the commission's collateral estoppel argument, and thus, for the foregoing reasons, the court did not consider the issue of collateral estoppel by way of a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a group of city taxpayers, commenced a declaratory judgment action against defendants, a city and a collection agency. The suit sought temporary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting defendants from charging a 15 percent collection fee when collecting said back taxes. Defendants filed an objection to the class certification, stating that there was no need to certify the class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legal action alleged various causes of action against defendants arising out of their practices and procedures for the collection of back taxes. The taxpayers argued that their action satisfied the requirements of Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect;&sect; 9-7 and 9-8, in that the necessary elements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy were sufficiently met, as were the requirements of predominance and superiority. Defendants argued that the decision as to the constitutionality of the statutes, as claimed by the taxpayers, would bind defendants without the need for class certification. The trial court found that the class potentially consisted of a minimum number of over 2,500 taxpayers. The class included many persons of different income levels, educational levels, ages, and physical abilities, making it unlikely that the proposed class members would seek and retain individual counsel to prosecute their individual claims. Additionally, it would be difficult for the court to manage in excess of 2,500 individual claims. This proposed class challenged defendants' taxing procedures and practices on their face and as they were applied. As such, the class was certified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a prisoner, sought a writ of habeas corpus.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-48 and 53a-54a. The prisoner received a total sentence of 15 years. At the time he was convicted, the prisoner's public defender informed him that he would be eligible for parole upon the completion of 50 percent of his sentence. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-125a set forth the basic statutory parameters for parole eligibility. Conspiracy to commit murder was not listed as an offense that was not eligible for parole. After defendant's conviction, the Board of Parole amended its rules to include some conspiracy crimes as parole-ineligible crimes. To establish a cognizable claim of an ex post fact violation, the prisoner had to make a colorable showing that the new policy created a genuine risk that he would be incarcerated longer under this new policy than under the previous situation. An employee of the Board of Parole stated that based on defendant's actions, which included shooting the victim in the head to make certain he was dead, the Board of Parole would not have granted parole to the prisoner. Therefore, the court held that there was no ex post facto violation of the prisoner's rights.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 8-8, the decision of defendant planning and zoning commission, that granted the application of defendant, an educational society, for a special permit to build a theater complex on their property that bordered the owners' property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property was owned by the society, and was on the grounds of a local state university. The property owners objected to the commission's approval of the application, contending that the commission failed to take into account parking problems associated with the theater and the fact that similar applications had been denied because such businesses were not authorized in an RAR-90 zone. The court found that the commission's decision regarding the issue of parking was reflective of the uniqueness of the society's proposed use of the subject property and was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. The record indicated that this proposal was unique. The theater proposal was not a movie theater or a commercial theater venue, it was a replica of an ancient Greek theater designed as a mechanism to promote the goals of the society, the preservation of the Greek language and the cultivation and promotion of Hellenic heritage in the new world. Thus, the commission did not abuse its discretion in determining that the theater was an educational use permissible in an RAR-90 zone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' complaint was against the officials in their official and individual capacities. The complaint sought, in part, monetary damages and various injunctions. The trial court had denied the officials' motion to dismiss based on caselaw. The law in Connecticut changed subsequent to the denial of the motion to dismiss. On a claim for money damages, regardless of whether plaintiffs alleged that the officials acted in excess of statutory authority, plaintiffs had to seek a waiver from the claims commissioner before filing suit. The officials, however, did not have statutory immunity for wanton, reckless, malicious actions, or for actions not performed within the scope of their employment. Plaintiffs could circumvent sovereign immunity in declaratory or injunctive relief actions where the officials acted in excess of statutory authority. Thus, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims filed against the officials in their official capacities that sought monetary damages, because the waiver of the claims commissioner had not been obtained. The claims for injunctive relief and alleging wanton, reckless, or malicious behavior remained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss was granted insofar as plaintiffs sued the officials in their official capacities seeking monetary, punitive, and exemplary damages and costs and fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury returned a verdict for plaintiff in her personal injury action against defendant arising out of a motor vehicle accident, defendant filed a motion to stay and preclude the award of offer of judgment interest under Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff purported guardians brought an action against defendants, a department of children and families (DCF) commissioner and four DCF employees, in their individual capacities, asserting that defendants acted tortiously and in violation of federal law and the Connecticut and United States Constitutions in their treatment of the guardians concerning the placement of an orphaned child. Defendants moved to strike each count of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardians tried to take custody of the child, per his parents' will, after the parents died. Defendants refused to place the child with the guardians based on allegations about their religious practices. The guardians sued under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1985, 1986; the Connecticut Constitution; and for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). The court denied the motion to strike the federal claims, which rested on the First Amendment, because there were sufficient facts to state a claim of religious discrimination and specific allegations of a conspiracy. The guardians failed to state a claim under the Connecticut Constitution because there was no direct cause of action thereunder and a statutory remedial scheme for religious discrimination was in place. Defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity because it had been established that it was unconstitutional for state officials to penalize individuals for their religious beliefs. The guardians' willful misconduct and IIED claims survived given the claim of intentional religious discrimination. The court declined to strike the claim for injunctive relief ordering defendants to destroy all relevant DCF records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendants' motion to strike the guardians' claims that asserted causes of action directly under provisions of the Connecticut Constitution. In all other respects, defendants' motion to strike was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had numerous criminal convictions and challenged two dockets in particular, arguing that he was entitled to 546 days of presentence confinement applied to docket one, as well as 304 days of presentence confinement to be applied to docket four. The inmate was totally discharged from the docket one sentence about two years prior to filing the instant petitions. The court had subject matter jurisdiction over the claim as to the discharged sentence in docket one because the inmate was &quot;in custody&quot; for a consecutive sentence that comprised part of an aggregate term. As to the 546 days sought in docket one, the inmate was not entitled to presentence confinement credit for time simultaneously held both in lieu of bond and as a sentenced prisoner. As to docket one, the inmate had received all of the presentence confinement credit to which he was entitled under the law. As to the docket four sentence, the inmate's current controlling sentence, the inmate was not entitled to any presentence credit whatsoever because he was already a sentenced prisoner at the time he was arrested on docket four and remained such during the entire presentence confinement portion on that docket.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, state agents and employees, filed a motion for summary judgment in the trial court (Connecticut), which was considered as a motion to dismiss, in a suit for damages under Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officials argued that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, as they had statutory and sovereign immunity. The prisoner alleged that the state officials negligently managed the treatment of his injured elbow, causing a loss of motion of his arm. Specifically, the prisoner claimed that defendants failed to transport him to followup visits after his medical treatment and failed to provide him with the recommended physical therapy. The trial court noted that although the prisoner brought the suit against various state agents and employees, the State itself was not a named defendant and defendants were sued in their individual capacities, not their official capacities. However, the trial court found that the complaint did not sufficiently state a cause of action in recklessness so as to strip defendants of their statutory immunity pursuant to Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant doctor filed a motion to set aside the verdict, a motion for remittitur, and an objection to the bill of costs; and plaintiff widow filed a motion to impose offer of judgment interest. The widow sued, seeking to recover monetary damages for wrongful death and loss of consortium as a result of medical malpractice on the part of the doctor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence supported the jury's award to the decedent's estate where the decedent was an accomplished artist and sculptor. Also, evidence of the decedent's artistic endeavors was properly admitted and was not confusing. The widow's surgical expert had a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to reading radiological films and his testimony was helpful to the jury in considering the issues. The fact that he was not a radiologist went to the weight of the testimony, not admissibility. The jury awarded a total amount of $ 2.2 million. While the amount was a considerable sum, given the death of a talented 64-year-old man, who left a widow who had little left for herself in her new country, the award did not shock the sense of justice of the court. The award was supported by the evidence, and remittitur was denied. An award of offer of judgment interest was ordered pursuant Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-192a(b). Costs related to certain mechanical drawings and photographs were reasonable. Finally, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-260(f), where a full day fee for a doctor was a windfall, the fee was reduced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor's motions to set aside the verdict and for a new trial and his motion for remittitur were denied. The widow's motion to impose offer of judgment interest was granted. The doctor's objection to the bill of costs was sustained in part, whereby the costs were reduced by $ 4,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Counsel, who represented defendant, referred to as &quot;acquittee,&quot; in a criminal trial, and who had, at the request of the acquittee, moved for the trial court to order a grand jury investigation of how the acquittee's redacted e-mail message, referred to as Exhibit 11, got into the State's possession for admission in the trial. The trial court denied the motion and gave counsel notice proposing sanctions. Counsel moved to not impose them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The acquittee was found not guilty of the two charges against her. Exhibit 11 allegedly had a negative effect on her dissolution action and relationship with her child, in spite of her fortuitous acquittal. The counsel contended that Exhibit 11 (1) was an attorney-client privileged communication, (2) had been altered by someone other than the acquittee, (3) was not admissible, and (3) was not subject to any waiver of the privilege. The acquittee was attempting to use unorthodox procedures to find out who was responsible for Exhibit 11, possibly the State or her husband, but should have complained to law enforcement persons or commenced a civil suit. The trial court, discussing the duality of the duty of counsel to the trial court as well as the acquittee, essentially found that counsel's claims were frivolous enough to subject him to sanctions. The frivolousness finding was based, in part, upon the trial court's conclusion that the law was clear that his positions were not sustainable. Counsel had not objected to the admission of Exhibit 11 at trial, and had, in fact, admitted an unredacted version of it at trial. The trial court found the privilege was clearly waived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found clear and convincing evidence that the counsel violated rules of professional conduct regarding his duties to the trial court as an officer of the trial court, frivolous positions, and engaging in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice, denied the counsel's motion not to impose sanctions, and decided it was going to imposed sanctions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners sought review of two decisions of defendant Brookfield, Connecticut, Zoning Board of Appeals. In the first decision, the Board denied their appeal from a zoning enforcement officer's denial of a zoning permit to build on two adjoining properties, and in the second, the Board denied their requests for variances from lot size requirements applicable to those properties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners conveyed their property to a family trust of which they were beneficiaries, leaving themselves with a life interest. The court held that this interest was sufficient to make them aggrieved parties with standing to appeal denial of permission to develop the two substandard-sized, adjoining lots. Because they failed to introduce evidence in the administrative record in the form of a deed predating the regulations that increased the minimum lot size for their district, the landowners failed to show that their lots were entitled to grandfathered status as buildable nonconforming lots. The standard for obtaining a variance pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-6 was very high--the landowners would have to have shown that the effect of the minimum lot size would have been the complete deprivation of use of their property. Since the landowners could still develop their lots as a single parcel instead of two, they could not meet that standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner, who had been returned to prison after he violated parole, requested a writ of habeas corpus against respondent prison warden. The prisoner's request was precipitated by the parole board's setting a date for his next parole hearing 15 years in the future. The warden moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The warden's motion was to dismiss (1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the prisoner had not pleaded a cognizable claim, and (2) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The prisoner had originally been incarcerated, in 1980, for a term of from 15 years to life for the crime of murder. After the prisoner's concessions, the prisoner was saying that he was properly being held in detention, had no right to demand another parole hearing, and that the parole board had no obligation to ever schedule another parole hearing, but that the parole board's rescheduling his hearing 15 years in the future was arbitrary and capricious. That argument was not valid, since the prisoner had conceded that he never had a right to have a hearing scheduled in the first place. The trial court summarized the history of the important writ of habeas corpus, but concluded that the prisoner had not stated a cognizable claim that he had been illegally confined. The prisoner had not stated a legal right of which he had been deprived. There was no illegal confinement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pool contractor filed an administrative appeal pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183 to challenge a decision of the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Protection, which found that it had violated the Home Improvement Act (the Act), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-418 et seq., and ordered that the contractor, among other things, was to pay restitution to a consumer pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-432(h) and was not entitled to setoff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor and the consumer entered into a written contract for construction of a pool that fully complied with the requirements set forth in Conn.

The consumer properly exercised that right, but the contractor's salesman negotiated an oral agreement that was never reduced to writing. The contractor rendered certain services in the nature of preliminary work, and the consumer again cancelled the contract, but the deposit was never returned. Affirming in part and reversing in part, the court held that: (1) the contractor could not recover via a theory of quasi-contract of quantum meruit for partial or even full performance of the contract because the contract did not comply with the Act; thus, the commissioner properly denied setoff; (2) the contractor did not carry its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-432 was unconstitutional under Conn. Const. arts. 2, 4, &sect; 1 because the Act did not significantly interfere with the orderly conduct of superior court judicial functions; but (3) there was no direct evidence of the reasonableness of the consumer's attorneys fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1957, the inmate was convicted of murder, and sentenced to death. The death sentence was subsequently commuted to life in prison, and the inmate was eventually paroled. However, the inmate's parole was revoked after being accused of inappropriate sexual advances upon a counselor. In his petition for habeas corpus, the inmate claimed that a certain phrase contained in his parole orders was void for vagueness and was, therefore, unconstitutional. The trial court concluded that no reasonable person would not know that attempted sexual assault, inappropriate sexual advances which included physical touching in the woman's private parts which in itself was a sexual assault, and threatening the woman with such language as she had described that clearly put her in fear of her life, were actions by the inmate which were incompatible with the welfare of society. Accordingly, the phraseology of condition 11 of the inmate's parole was not unconstitutionally vague. Further, the trial court noted that at least 16 other states utilized the standard that the conduct must be compatible with the welfare of society.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a town and the town planning and zoning commission, moved to dismiss plaintiff property owner's action arising from a subdivision approval dispute on the grounds that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, the commission argued that the property owner did not exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to three counts and the matters were not ripe for review in a fourth count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner applied for a residential subdivision on land that he owned. As a condition for approval, the commission required the property owner to install sidewalks on adjacent property which he did not own at the time. However, he subsequently purchased that property. The commission approved the property owner's plan with a condition that the property agreed to install so much of the sidewalk as allowed by the inland wetlands agency and he would pay into a separate account the necessary monies enabling the town to install the remaining sidewalk. As of the date of the complaint, the town had not completed the remainder of the sidewalk. At the time the application was approved, there was no ordinance or regulation authorizing a &quot;sidewalk fund,&quot; nor was there any state statutory authority. Nonetheless, the property owner failed to appeal the commission's decision pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8. The court held that while the commission's actions were not in conformance with its own regulations, that was not enough to find that the property owner had met the high standard allowing for collateral attack. Thus, there was not any actual pending controversy between the parties.</SPAN></P>

However, the applicant failed to appeal the commission's decision. The commission later amended its regulations and authorized the payment of fees to a sidewalk fund. The applicant then sued. The court dismissed the applicant's counts that alleged that the commission's sidewalk fund assessment was illegal and that the town was unjustly enriched because the applicant had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and he further failed to meet the high standard required to permit a collateral attack. The court dismissed the applicant's claim that the new regulation was unconstitutional because he had no pending dispute or controversy with the commission. As there was no actual pending controversy, the matter was not justiciable and invoking Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-55 did not create subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Connecticut Commissioner of Administrative Services, Commissioner of Correction, and Attorney General, filed a motion to strike the substitute complaint of plaintiffs, an inmate and a decedent's executrix, which alleged a violation of the inmate's constitutional rights after the State applied Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-85b(b) and made a claim against the inmate's inheritance for repayment of his incarceration costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decedent's executrix and the inmate filed their original action, which asserted a denial of the inmate's substantive due process rights by the State's attempt to take his inheritance for repayment of incarceration costs, in that the inmate's sentence predated &sect; 18-85b(b). That complaint was stricken and plaintiffs filed a substitute complaint which focused on a violation of the inmate's equal protection rights. The court found that the allegations of the complaint were insufficient to state a cause of action. The court noted that there was nothing that required that taxation had to be equal and uniform. There was no dispute by the inmate as to his incarcerated status, nor to the lien amount, and accordingly, any procedural due process violation was de minimus at best. The court also noted that an inmate had no vested right to free room and board while incarcerated, thereby negating the inmate's substantive due process claim. The equal protection claims lacked merit, as asserting the cost lien randomly was permissible where there was no invidious or illegitimate use of such a lien. The equal protection claims against &sect; 18-85b(b) failed under the rational basis standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Where the motion to dismiss filed by plaintiff Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Transportation in the eminent domain proceeding, alleging that defendant landowner could only appeal the matter with a citation and the appeal was filed beyond the limitations period under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13a-76, was denied, the trial court revisited the matter in light of a recent Supreme Court of Connecticut decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner filed a notice of condemnation and assessment of damages. Under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13a-76, the landowner had six months from the filing of the notice to appeal the assessment of damages. Only after the expiration of the six-month period did the landowner receive notice. The six-month limitations period did not begin to run until the landowner received notice of the condemnation. The landowner was not entitled to attorneys fees under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13a-76a, due to the delay between the filing of a map under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13a-57 and the filing of a certificate of taking under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13a-73. There was no evidence that the delay caused the landowner to incur attorneys fees. The landowner was entitled to severance damages. The landowner's property was a gas station. The taking made the property less desirable, as it created sloped driveways, and it impacted upon commercial truck access to the gas station. Prior to the taking, the property had a fair market value, based on the income approach, of $ 1,700,000. As a result of the decrease in rental income, the fair market value was reduced to $ 1,270,000, resulting in a loss of $ 430,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was entered in favor of the landowner and against the Commissioner for $ 442,000. In addition, the landowner was entitled to interest at the rate of eight percent per annum from the date of taking, plus a reasonable fee for its appraiser's report.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a prisoner, filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking to challenge the sentence of death that was imposed upon him. Respondent, a warden, filed a motion to dismiss several portions of the instant petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The warden argued that the prisoner failed to state grounds upon which relief could be granted, failed to satisfy the cause and prejudice test, and that the claims were barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel. The court held that the petition essentially argued that the prisoner's detention and convictions were illegal because he was deprived of his constitutional right to counsel. The court held that it was clear that the petition did, at least on its face, state some grounds upon which relief could be granted. Therefore, the motion to dismiss had to be denied as to all portions of the petition which alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the court held that it lacked authority to declare any final decision of an appellate court, either state or federal, to be in error. A number of the prisoner's claims sought to overturn prior appellate decisions, and the motion to dismiss had to be granted as to those claims. Defendant's claim that Connecticut's capital punishment scheme constituted cruel and unusual punishment also had to be dismissed, as this issue was decided adversely to defendant on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a father, filed suit against defendants, the State, the state support enforcement services division, and a support enforcement officer, seeking injunctive relief; compensatory and punitive damages from the support officer only pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983; and attorney fees and costs from all defendants pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the support officer's recordation of a judgment entered against him for delinquent child support payments, which he allegedly did not owe, violated his constitutional rights. The trial court held the father neither alleged a statutory basis for a waiver of sovereign immunity nor any facts to establish that defendants acted in excess of their statutory authority or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. The support officer was protected by absolute judicial immunity, as her activities were integrally related to the judicial process and her actions were taken in the course of her official duties. The support officer was entitled to qualified immunity as to the claim for money damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because she did not violate any of the father's clearly established statutory or constitutional rights. Finally, the father's failure to exhaust administrative remedies deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. The father did not allege that he availed himself of his remedies under the Connecticut Family Support Magistrate's Act, nor did he allege that it would be either futile or inadequate for him to have pursued such relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's request for injunctive and monetary relief against defendants in their official or individual capacities was denied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF) moved for articulation, requesting the court to set forth the duties and responsibilities of the guardian ad litem (GAL) who was appointed for respondent mother. The DCF also requested that the court delineate the obligation of the mother's attorney to look to the GAL for decisions made on behalf of the mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent father had filed an order of temporary custody application, along with a petition alleging that the child was neglected and uncared for. The court appointed a GAL for the mother. The mother had the ability to communicate and function at the level of a person who was aged six to nine. She could not reason in an abstract way. She was incompetent for purposes of trial. The mother made it clear that she preferred the immediate return of her child who was in DCF's care. She did not want the child to remain in the care of others. But DCF's opposition did not, in and of itself, mean that the mother's preferences were not reasonable or that they had not been strongly articulated. Although the mother was not competent for purposes of trial, that status did not extinguish the constitutional protections to which she was entitled as the child's biological parent. The court determined it should hear both the position advocated on behalf of the mother, and the position taken by the GAL, as such a protocol would aid in the achievement of the fair and impartial resolution which was called for.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the interests of justice were best served by allowing the GAL to address the mother's best interests, while her attorney advocated to achieve her expressed preferences during the pre-trial and trial proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs retained the attorneys to investigate a potential product liability action on their behalf arising from the car accident, which was possibly due to a defective seatbelt. Before the vehicle's seatbelts were properly inspected, the victim's mother sold the car to her insurer, which then sold it at an auction and it was thereafter destroyed. The legal malpractice claim alleged that the attorneys breached their duty of care by failing to prevent spoliation of the evidence, and that they breached their contractual agreement to provide legal services. The attorneys moved for summary judgment and the court held that the claims were barred by the applicable limitations periods. The legal malpractice claim sounded in negligence due to the alleged breach of the duty of care and came within the three-year tort limitations period of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-577. The contract limitations period, whether covered by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 52-576 or 52-581, also had run on the claims. There was no relation back to plaintiffs' earlier dismissed action, nor were plaintiffs' constitutional rights to redress violated by imposing limitations periods.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff grandparents sought to enforce a decision of the Superior Court, Pima County (Arizona) by registering the foreign matrimonial judgment pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-70. The Arizona court determined that defendant mother was not acting in the best interest of a minor child in failing to grant rights of visitation to the grandparents and that the presumption of parental primacy had been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child in question was born in Arizona in 1994 and her mother opposed the grandparents' visitation. The matter had a long procedural history, during which the mother was represented by counsel and took an active role in the case with the exception of leaving the jurisdiction on the eve of a hearing. The grandparents sought to enforce the Arizona judgment and the court held that the Arizona decree was a foreign matrimonial judgment within the meaning of &sect; 46b-70 because the mother was aware of the action's pendency, she had an opportunity to participate fully, and there was no due process violation. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-59 provided that visitation could be granted upon application of &quot;any person&quot; and the term &quot;grandparent&quot; was included within the broader term &quot;any person&quot; under the statute. Thus, the Arizona decree granting visitation rights to the grandparents did not per se violate the public policy of Connecticut. The court had jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-1 and the mother's motion to dismiss was denied. The court denied the motion for summary judgment because, at best, it was premature, and as pleaded, the mother did not meet her burden.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the mother's motion to dismiss and her motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a town, its mayor, and its manager, moved for summary judgment in the trial court (Connecticut) in the suit filed by plaintiff, a town, seeking injunctive relief and damages for defendants' failure to construct a dam. The suit contained counts for, inter, alia, nuisance, trespass, violations of the Connecticut Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-14, and due process violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court held that plaintiff town owned land affected by flooding, and had standing to bring the action. The suit was not moot as to the manager, because plaintiff town sought damages, as well as injunctive relief. Defendants were not entitled to summary judgment due to governmental immunity because a factual issue remained as to whether the cause of plaintiff town's damages was defendants' conduct. Defendants' actions were clearly discretionary, but plaintiff town was within the foreseeable victim exception. There were factual issues as to whether plaintiff town's damages were caused by defendants' refusal to construct the dam for purposes of the nuisance claim. Summary judgment was granted on the trespass claims since there was no evidence that an affirmative, intentional act of defendants caused an invasion or intrusion onto plaintiff town's property. Allegations of omission to prevent flooding were not amenable to remedy under the CEPA. The due process claims failed because plaintiff town provided no support for its allegations that it had been deprived of property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' motion for summary judgment was denied as to the nuisance counts. Defendants' summary judgment motion was granted as to the remaining counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that no civil cause of action for stalking existed in Connecticut. The court agreed, concluding that there was no recognized civil cause of action equivalent to the criminal offense of stalking, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-151e. However, the victim implicitly, if not expressly, alleged sufficient facts to substantiate a cause of action for invasion of privacy. She specifically alleged that the alleged stalker commenced a long and continuous course of conduct involving following, photographing, and telephoning the victim, as well as trespassing on the premises of the victim. She further alleged that the conduct continued throughout the year 2002, during which time defendant was repeatedly arrested for and once convicted for stalking. Finally, the victim properly alleged a cause of action for IIED. Although she did not specifically use the words &quot;outrageous&quot; or &quot;extreme&quot; to characterize the numerous acts alleged, the simple recitation of the acts and the universal abhorrence associated with such conduct permitted a finding that the requisite elements of a cause of action sounding in IIED had been properly pled. Intent could be inferred from the conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that since Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-46a(e), (f), and (j) as it related to the weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors did not establish a defined burden of proof, the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court found that the issue was before the Connecticut Supreme Court, but under the existing law the procedure for a weighing determination was constitutional. The requirement that defendant prove that the mitigating factors were mitigating by a preponderance of the evidence did not create a constitutionally intolerable risk that when weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors, jurors would not include mitigating factors. There was nothing in the statutory language or in the law interpreting the language to lead to the conclusion that the jury would refuse to consider mitigating evidence. The statute did not violate the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution or Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8, 9 because there was a meaningful basis for determining when the death penalty was imposed. The statute was not unconstitutional because of its failure to charge individual persons with sentencing authority.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-196, which was enacted after the permit had been issued. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the owner was issued a permit to build a hot mix asphalt plant, &sect; 22a-196 was enacted, which banned siting such plants within one-third of a mile of a watercourse. Since the plant would violate this ban, the Department terminated the owner's permit. The owner alleged that application of &sect; 22a-196 to its permit was an illegal retroactive application of a substantive statute, and that &sect; 22a-196 lacked a rational basis and was thus unconstitutional. The court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because these claims were not justiciable. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-174(n), which went into effect before Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-196, placed a moratorium on the issuance of permits for asphalt batch plants; by its terms, this moratorium applied to the owner. Before the effective date of the moratorium, the owner had a right to proceed with the permitting process in accordance with relevant law; imposition of the moratorium suspended this right and rendered it speculative. No matter how the court ruled on the merits, the owner would still not be able to proceed with the permitting process unless and until the moratorium expired or was otherwise lifted by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party, a state employee, claimed that on two separate occasions, the coworker made defamatory statements against the injured party, accusing her of doing violence to the coworker.

The injured party alleged that the supervisors knew or should have known that the coworker's accusations were false, but they failed to comply with the requirements of an executive order requiring the supervisors to initiate an investigation of violence in the workplace.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a consumer credit coalition and its president, filed suit against defendants, employees of the Connecticut Department of Banking, in their individual capacities, alleging violations of the First Amendment and equal protection rights of the coalition and its president. The employees moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and moved to dismiss the complaint as to the individual for lack of standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees moved to dismiss the suit as to the president for lack of standing. The trial court held that the complaint did not allege a direct injury to the president, separate and distinct of the injuries suffered by the coalition. The president lacked standing to bring the suit and the counts brought in the president's individual capacity were dismissed. The employees' actions in conducting an examination of the coalition's business records were administrative in nature, and thus, the employees were not shielded by absolute immunity. The motion to dismiss as to those claims brought by the coalition against the employees was denied. However, the action against the employee who ordered the revocation of the coalition's license for its failure to cooperate with the Department's investigation was acting in a quasi-judicial capacity and was entitled to absolute immunity. The suit was dismissed against the employee who ordered revocation of the coalition's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss was granted as to the counts brought by the president individually. The motion to dismiss was denied as to the official acts of the employees in conducting an examination of the coalition's business records. The motion to dismiss was granted as to the employee's act in ordering the revocation of the coalition's license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that under contemporary standards, capital punishment was not decent, reliable, or of any measurable benefit to society and that it was arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory.

I, &sect;&sect; 8, 9, 20. The multi-tiered pyramid met the prerequisite of consistency and reliability. It channeled the discretion of a sentencing judge or jury to assure that the death penalty was being imposed consistently and reliably and permitted a sentencing judge or jury to consider an individual defendant's character or record and the circumstances of a particular offense. Because it was not within the court's province to overrule or discard the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, it was bound to follow them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a trucking company and its owners, sued defendants, the State, the department of environmental protection, and an individual, seeking a declaratory judgment that defendants violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the Connecticut Constitution, a permanent injunction restraining defendants from prohibiting plaintiffs from operating their business, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney fees. Defendants moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the enactment of legislation authorizing the department to regulate the transshipment of hazardous waste, the department issued a notice of violation to plaintiffs and ordered them to cease all transshipment activities or face fines of $ 25,000 per day. Defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because they were protected from suit by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and no exception to that doctrine applied. In deciding whether to grant the motion, the court considered whether plaintiffs' allegations and the factual underpinnings of those allegations demonstrated in incursion upon constitutionally protected interests such that sovereign immunity did not bar plaintiffs' action. Among other things, the court found that the plaintiffs did not have a legitimate claim of entitlement to the permit because under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-454, the commissioner had the discretion to deny the application. In addition, the court concluded that keeping one from conducting business did not equate to a taking of property. Finally, plaintiffs failed to show that they were treated differently than any other similarly situated company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An agency employee received an anonymous call that the children were being abused. A doctor determined that the children were victims of physical abuse, and the children were removed from the mother's custody. While in agency custody, the discoloration of one of the children's skin worsened, and a blood test uncovered the fact that the child had a blood disorder which caused the discoloration that was mistaken for bruising. The mother alleged that agency employees were abusive, insulting, and threatening. The mother also claimed that agency employees continued their harassment after the children were returned. The agency defendants claimed that they were entitled to sovereign immunity and statutory immunity pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165. The court found that plaintiffs claimed that the agency defendants' conduct was wanton, reckless, or malicious. These allegations, read broadly in plaintiffs' favor, could lead a fact finder to conclude that the agency defendants were acting beyond the scope of their authority. Therefore, the agency defendants were not entitled to sovereign or statutory immunity.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 8-8, plaintiff property owner appealed the decision of defendant, the Planning Commission of the City of Danbury (Connecticut), which denied an application for a special exception because the application created conditions that would adversely affect the traffic safety as specified in Danbury, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 10.C.4.a.(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner owned a lot that had a 39,540-square-foot building on it. General office use of the property was allowed, but a special exception was needed for uses that generated more than 500 daily vehicle trips. The property owner procured as a potential tenant a group of dermatologists. Because the dermatology practice would generate 600 daily vehicle trips, a special exception was required. On appeal, the property owner raised three claims: that the regulations were unconstitutionally vague, that the Commission's decision was not supported by the record, and that the Commission's decision was against the weight of the expert witness testimony. The court found that there was ample testimony at the hearing as to the heavy traffic congestion that surrounded the property. The property owner's own traffic engineering study and testimony from residents in the area provided a substantial basis for the Commission's decision. In addition, the Commission was not bound to follow any expert's opinion, there was nothing unreasonable, illegal or arbitrary about its decision, and the property owner had not met its burden of showing that the regulations were unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff worked part-time as a bartender. On several occasions, plaintiff engaged in sexual conduct with female customers. At least one woman complained that plaintiff coerced her into having sex. Defendant learned of plaintiff's activities, and reported the information to the sheriff. Defendant also provided an investigator with materials from plaintiff's personnel file which dealt with complaints made against plaintiff while defendant was plaintiff's supervisor. Defendant claimed that sovereign immunity barred the suit because he was acting in his official capacity at all times and at no time exceeded his authority. The court held that nothing defendant was alleged to have done in the present action was outside the scope of his employment. Defendant's conduct in the present action was in furtherance of a legitimate state purpose related to his employment, namely the sheriff department's investigation into allegations of professional misconduct involving a deputy sheriff. Even if defendant was not the proper person to transmit the personnel file materials, such conduct did not rise to the level of being in excess of statutory authority so as to defeat sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the professor neither sought nor obtained authorization for the suit from a state claims commissioner. The court further held that the professor's claim for injunctive relief did not assert a constitutional or statutory transgression. The court held that an exception to sovereign immunity for action for injunctive relief on constitutional or statutory grounds did not apply where the injunctive relief sought merely asserted a breach of contract. Therefore, the court held that sovereign immunity applied, and the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear and determine the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient sought money damages based on an alleged disclosure of his patient records. The court held that in the absence of specific legislative authority, the claims against the State and the hospital were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The individual enjoyed the same immunity. There was no claim that the individual acted pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. Even if the sovereign immunity were not available to the individual, she would enjoy statutory immunity under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165. There was no evidence of any wanton, reckless, or malicious conduct on her part. Although the patient sought future injunctive relief against possible disclosure or destruction of his medical records, the complaint itself was silent on such possibilities. Therefore, the exception was moot and defendants were entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-417d(d)(5). After a mistrial was declared due to a hung jury, defendant moved to dismiss the charge. The State opposed the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into agreements with a couple regarding the construction of a new home. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to justify placing him on trial, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and the statute defining the offense charged was unconstitutional. The court denied the motion to dismiss holding that the agreement fell within the purview of the New Home Construction Contractors Act. The evidence established that defendant contracted with the owners to construct, for a fee, portions of a home that was in the process of being newly constructed and was not yet occupied. No reasonable interpretation of the term &quot;home remodeler&quot; could have included such activity. Further, a person of ordinary intelligence would have had fair warning that defendant's conduct of contracting with owners of a vacant lot to construct portions of the owners' new home would constitute a violation of the New Home Construction Contractors Act. Thus, the definition of &quot;new home construction contractor&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the defendant's conduct. Whether or not defendant classified himself as a sub-contractor or home remodeler was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that the agency properly determined that the moratorium did not place an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorneys argued that their payment of clients' medically related costs as court costs and expenses of litigation was permitted under Conn. R. Prof. Conduct 1.8(e)(1). The appellate court rejected an extension of the rationale for approving an advancement of the cost of an MRI to the cost of medical treatment. Rule 1.8(e) was narrowly construed. The attorneys' selection from their clientele of individuals whom they concluded needed to have medical treatment expenses advanced in order to better develop the clients' claims constituted unregulated lending to clients and was prohibited. The attorneys' contention that the prohibition of advancing medically related costs to clients was unconstitutional under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 was also rejected. One of the attorneys also violated Conn. R. Prof. Conduct 7.2(c) by paying employees for client referrals, as the practice amounted to a payment for recommending the firm. The attorney's argument that the payments were bonuses, permissible under Conn. R. Prof. Conduct 5.4(a), was rejected. Conn. R. Prof. Conduct 7.2 prohibited anything which provided value to the referrer, including payments and bonuses for case referrals.</SPAN></P>

The State further argued that because the Claims Commissioner of Connecticut had earlier determined that it was without jurisdiction to hear the claim and because the Legislature was without jurisdiction to grant permission to sue, the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter based on sovereign immunity. The court found that it did not lack subject matter jurisdiction over the claim based on sovereign immunity. Furthermore the Act did not violate Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 because the Act was not a public emolument serving no purpose, as the Act served the public purpose of helping to determine whether an employer could be held negligent for overworking an employee, a public policy question that the Legislature was looking to the courts to resolve.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Haddam, Connecticut, Zoning Board of Appeals denied plaintiff owner's application for a variance from Haddam, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect;&sect; 4.1.b.3.f., 4.1.b.4., regarding, respectively, 150 feet minimum lot width for a point no more than 500 feet back from a public street, and such a lot to be one acre larger than the minimum required for its zone, to subdivide his 5.67 acres into two interior lots. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's predecessor owned the land when the State acquired a portion bisecting the land in fee simple, absolute ownership, in 1871 for construction of a railroad. The State's abandonment of the railroad line did not create a reversion to the owner or reserve rights to him. The assumption was made that the predecessor was compensated by the State. The zoning was not a practical confiscation and, under a balancing of private and public interests, was not an unconstitutional taking since the owner's residential use was a valuable use even if not the highest and best use; the land was not rendered practically worthless. The owner did not have a vested right to obtain a variance because the owner was not being denied a permitted use of the land previously allowed before the zoning regulations were enacted. The owner's act of subdivision created the nonconforming use. The owner had actual knowledge of the railroad bisection and was presumed to have actual knowledge of the zoning regulations. Therefore, the owner's hardship was self-created by his purchase of the land. Substantively, the land subdivision did not satisfy either of the two zoning regulation requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court found that the Board did not act arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Planning and Zoning Commission of the City of Bridgeport (Connecticut) adopted two zoning regulations, Bridgeport, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect;&sect; 14-4 7-1(b), 14-4 7-1(c). Plaintiff zoning board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning board argued that the adoption of Bridgeport, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 14-4 7-1(b) precluded it from granting any use variance within certain specified zones. The court found that the zoning board was classically aggrieved. The court held that a zoning commission's legislative discretion was not to be disturbed by the courts unless it acted arbitrarily or illegally. The record did not support the wholesale destruction of the zoning board's ability to grant a use variance pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-6(a)(3). The Commission was prohibiting the legislatively authorized zoning board from exercising its statutory powers. The amendment was an improper complete divestment of the zoning board's powers to grant use variances. In adopting the amendment, the Commission acted beyond its power. The mandatory site plan review of Bridgeport, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 14-4 7-1(c) did not inappropriately contradict, limit, or displace the authority of the zoning board to grant variances pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-6, and its adoption was not contrary to law and was not an abuse of the Commission's broad discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal was sustained with regard to the Commission's adoption of the first zoning regulation and dismissed with regard to the adoption of the second regulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff assault victim sued defendants, police officers and a city, alleging that the actions and omissions of the police officers and the city were reckless and negligent in relation to an investigation of confrontations with the assault victim, and deprived her of her equal protection rights. The police officers and the city moved to strike all seven counts of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assault victim reported to the police that she was attacked. After a second confrontation, a protective order was issued. A third confrontation occurred after the protective order was issued. When questioned by the police officers, the attacker admitted that he had confronted the assault victim. The police officers did not arrest the attacker, however. The court found the complaint alleged acts and omissions from which a pattern showing indifference on the part of the police officers could be inferred. The complaint sufficiently alleged causes of action based on a deprivation of the assault victim's equal protection rights and a failure to act based on an unlawful pattern, custom, practice, or administrative classification against females. Since, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-38b(a), the police officers owed a duty to the assault victim to protect her from the attacker, the complaint survived the claim of governmental immunity. However, two counts were devoid of factual content as to claims of recklessness. Since the police officers may have been liable, claims for indemnification under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7-101a, 7-465a were properly asserted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the city continuously from February 15, 1965, until October 20, 2000. The employee's years of service totaled 39.92, which included military service. On appeal, the primary issue was whether the fractional share of the employee's total service (.92) was included in the pension calculation. The second issue was whether the city violated specific sections of the contract by refusing to include the contractual &quot;Top Step Bonus&quot; in the pension calculations. The court concluded that the Board's decision in awarding the employee a service pension without the fractional share was not unreasonable, arbitrary, illegal, or an abuse of discretion. The Board properly based its calculation on the 39 full years of service without the inclusion of the additional .92 years. Military service was utilized to determine an employee's length of service with the city and his entitlement to a pension, while the amount of the actual pension was calculated by reference to completed years of service. In addition, the court found that the &quot;Top Step Bonus&quot; was not to be included in the calculation of regular annual pay for the purpose of computing the employee's pension benefit.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that habeas relief in Connecticut was no longer strictly limited to challenges to confinement, so the Eighth Amendment claim could be heard, since it was closely related to the fact of confinement. The prisoner's First Amendment claims, however, were more in the nature of challenges to particular conditions of confinement, and these would have to be pursued in the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action that the prisoner was simultaneously pursuing in a federal court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court initially found that the matter was against the State, in that it had been asserted against the Chairman in his official capacity. Sovereign immunity did not bar the bringing of the action, as the claims fell within two of the noted exceptions to immunity because she alleged constitutional infringements, as well as violations and actions in excess of statutory authority. The claimant contended that the guidelines constituted violations of her due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court found the Chairman's claim that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the claim was not justiciable lacked merit. The court found the elements of justiciability were all satisfied in that there was a controversy, the parties were adverse, and relief could resolve the issue. The claimant had standing to bring the action because she was within the zone of interests which were protected by the Workers' Compensation Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-275 et seq.

The commissioner issued a discretionary ruling that the applicant's claim against the State was time-barred. No constitutional rights were implicated by that ruling, in which the commissioner did no more than apply the statute of limitations to the facts underlying the applicant's claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owners appealed from a decision by defendant wetlands commission (Connecticut) after it denied, after a public hearing, their application for a permit to permit them to construct a three bedroom, single family residence, including an access driveway and an on-site septic system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners contended that the commission's decision was not supported by substantial evidence. The appellate court held that the owners were aggrieved parties. The evidence focused on the location of the septic system, which was in close proximity to the wetlands. The evidence was not so complex and intricate as to be beyond the understanding and evaluation of the lay commissioners and members of the public. Each of the reasons given for the commission's decision were supported by substantial evidence. The potential for flooding was buttressed by pictorial and descriptive evidence. The relevant facts and circumstances mandated by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-41 were considered. The site was one-third wetlands, and the owners had difficulty in obtaining a two to one ratio for the mitigation required. The belief that installation of a successful septic system was questionable was supported, as the proposed septic system was located 25 feet from the wetlands. The failure to identify, on the record, feasible and prudent alternatives was not fatal, as the statutory criteria were considered, and the commission discussed alternatives with the owners during the hearings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Stat. &sect; 22a-363b to allow it to operate its electric cable across Long Island Sound, the company sought a temporary writ of mandamus to compel the DEP to consider its application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company applied for the COP in January 2003, so that it could operate the cable while curing areas where the cable was above the depth required by its DEP permit. An act codified at Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 16-241j, 25-157, 25-157c imposed a one-year moratorium starting June 3, 2002, on agencies considering applications relating to, inter alia, electric power line crossings of Long Island Sound. The company argued that the moratorium did not apply to its COP request and that it was unconstitutional. The court held that only two of the three mandamus requirements were met. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-363b(d) imposed a mandatory duty on the DEP to consider the COP request, and there was no adequate legal remedy aside from mandamus, but there was no clear legal right to have the application considered, as the moratorium clearly applied to the application. The constitutional claims also failed. The company had no property interest in the permit or a modification to support a due process claim. The Commerce Clause was not violated, as the moratorium did not discriminate against foreign entities and its burden on interstate commerce was not clearly excessive in relation to its local benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the application for a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State of Connecticut filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff truck owner's action, which sought recovery of monetary damages as well as declaratory relief arising from the State's handling of administrative and judicial proceedings involving his purchase of a defective truck from a licensed used car dealer, which had spanned more than 10 years. The motion was based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The truck dealer refused to fix the owner's truck, and the owner brought a civil action as well as filing a consumer complaint with the department of motor vehicles (DMV). The DMV entered into a consent agreement with the dealer, but the owner was not happy with it. After multiple administrative and judicial steps, the claims commissioner denied the owner the right to sue the State. The owner contended that his rights to equal protection through due process had been violated by agents of the DMV and by attorneys from the attorney general's office. The State's motion to dismiss was based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the doctrine of sovereign immunity and due to the State's allegation that the owner was attempting to appeal prior decisions in an inappropriate manner. The court found that the matter was not within any of the exceptions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-142 as to a waiver of the State's sovereign immunity. Further, it found that the common law exceptions to sovereign immunity were inapplicable. There were no facts which indicated that state agents acted in excess of their statutory authority or that they violated the owner's constitutionally protected rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mortgagee sued to foreclose a mortgage. Defendant mortgagors filed an answer asserting a set-off and special defenses (including violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110a et seq.) and counterclaims for breach of warranty, fraud, and a violation of CUTPA. The mortgagee filed motions to strike the special defenses, the set-off, and the counterclaims, and for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagee previously filed a foreclosure action, but withdrew it (allegedly on the eve of trial). The court struck the set-off and the mortgagors' special defenses: (1) they failed to allege the elements of equitable estoppel; (2) the &quot;unclean hands&quot; defense had no bearing on enforceability of the note or mortgage; (3) collateral estoppel and res judicata did not apply, as no issues were determined nor judgments entered in the first action; (4) they did not allege, in support of their laches defense, how the delay in filing the second action prejudiced them; (5) 12 U.S.C.S &sect; 4907 did not apply; and (6) they did not allege the elements of a CUTPA violation. Since the mortgagee submitted an affidavit stating that the note was in default, and the mortgagors did not controvert it, the mortgagee was entitled to summary judgment as to liability. As to the counterclaims, the mortgagors failed set out facts to support their fraud claim, which had to be pled with specificity. However, material facts existed as to whether the mortgagee's withdrawal of the first foreclosure action and failure to negotiate an insurance check violated CUTPA or breached the implied covenant of good faith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to strike the special defenses and the set-off was granted. The motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability under the complaint and to dismiss the fraud count of the counterclaim was granted. The motion for summary judgment as to the breach of warranty and CUTPA violation counts of the counterclaim was denied.</SPAN></P>

Intending to cite these men for loitering in violation of Hartford, Conn., Mun.

There had been no complaints, and none of the officers knew any of the men or had reason to believe they were armed. The court held that defendant had been &quot;seized&quot; for purposes of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 7, 9 (which provided greater protection than the Fourth Amendment), since a person in his position would believe he was not free to leave. The officer had no grounds to seize defendant for loitering, since an essential element of that offense -- impeding another's use of a sidewalk -- had not been present. The court also found that defendant did not try to flee, nor did he engage in any furtive movements. Due the illegal seizure of defendant, the gun had to be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.</SPAN></P>

The inmate was not challenging the underlying criminal order which caused him to be incarcerated, and his petition arose from the conditions of his confinement, rather than from a criminal matter, so he was not entitled to appointed counsel under &sect; 51-296(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Connecticut commenced a support petition against defendant father. The father moved for a court order for genetic tests. Plaintiff mother did not oppose the motion, but the State opposed the motion on the grounds that paternity was not at issue, having been determined by the acknowledgment. The father moved to open the judgment some three years after support was ordered and nearly five years after the acknowledgment was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother gave birth to the child, and two days later, she signed an affirmation naming who the child's father was. At the same time, the father executed the same form thereby acknowledging under oath that he was the father. The form included an advisement of rights on the reverse side, and a waiver of right to counsel, genetic tests, and trial just above the signature line. The father filed a motion to open the paternity proceedings more than three years after the date of the acknowledgment. The trial court found that this was well beyond the time bar in the statute. Therefore, the court did not have the authority to grant the motion absent proof by the moving party of an extraordinary factor such as fraud, mistake, or duress. Further, the acknowledgment form included a waiver of rights. There was no doubt that the father freely and voluntarily signed the acknowledgment. There was no evidence that the mother induced him to acknowledge the child or made false statements. The trial court found that the father had sufficient opportunity to raise the issue of paternity. He did not exercise reasonable diligence in pursuing such opportunities.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 1, 4 and 20, when they retaliated against the special deputy by removing him from his assignment to the transportation unit. Defendants filed special defenses of sovereign immunity and statutory immunity pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The special deputy claimed he was reassigned from the transportation unit because he failed to help with the high sheriff's campaign and refused to sign a statement placing blame on another special deputy. Defendants claimed that they were entitled to the protection of sovereign immunity, and alleged that the special deputy failed to prove that the high sheriff and the chief deputy were acting in excess of their authority since they had the authority to reassign special deputies without a hearing. Defendants also alleged that the special deputy was reassigned due to, inter alia, his having left a loaded gun in an unlocked van, damaging a van and failing to report the damage, and turning off his radio before being released for the day. In entering judgment for defendants, the superior court concluded that the special deputy had no proprietary right to work in transportation exclusively. The high sheriff and the chief deputy had the right to reassign him without a hearing; and finally, the special deputy produced no evidence to prove any causal connection between his reassignment and his alleged refusal to sign any statement or failure to support the high sheriff's campaign.</SPAN></P>

The fit parent had a long-standing domestic partnership with the nonparent, and the child was born as a result of the fit parent's artificial insemination. Shortly after the child's third birthday, the nonparent brought an action for visitation with the minor child. The petition alleged both that the nonparent not only had a parent-like relationship with the three-year-old child, but in fact that she had a parenting relationship. The nonparent also alleged that the fit parent's actions in denying contact between the child and the nonparent were extremely detrimental to the child's well-being. The parties then entered into a written stipulation setting forth a visitation plan between the nonparent and the child, which the trial court entered as a stipulated judgment. Thereafter, the fit parent moved to reopen and dismiss, and contended that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the stipulated judgment. The trial court found that it had subject matter jurisdiction and the issue of whether the petition contained sufficient allegations warranting visitation could not be decided on a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was identified as the person who committed the crime by the victim and a friend of defendant. To succeed on the motion to suppress, defendant had to prove that identification procedures were unnecessarily suggestive, and that the resulting identification was not reliable in the totality of the circumstances. The court held that the procedures used did not give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. The police in both instances used multiple photographs, and did not rely upon a single photo. The arrays themselves were composed of photos of individuals who all strongly resembled defendant. There were no suggestions made to either witness that a photo of the suspected perpetrator was located in the arrays presented to them. The court also held that the circumstances of the commission of the crime lent themselves to a determination that the identification was reliable. The perpetrator and the victim were in close proximity during daylight hours when the shooting occurred. Defendant's friend was in close proximity to the perpetrator and the victim when the shooting occurred. Therefore, the court held that suppression was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital moved to strike counts 107, 118, and 129 on the ground that they duplicated claims made in counts 74, 85, and 96. The trial court found that the counts at issue did not suggest that the decedent's wife was making any claim other than a derivative claim. The challenged counts stated a cause of action, albeit a repetitive one, and the motion to strike them was be denied. Neither party demonstrated that the context of the good samaritan law or its legislative history or any other key to meaning offered a different reading than the words of the statute support with regard to the creation or abolition of any cause of action. As such, courts could hardly have been using gross negligence as a point of comparison if gross negligence did not exist. The hospital's argument that there was no cause of action for gross negligence would have led to the absurd conclusion that in enacting the good samaritan law, the legislature was providing immunity for a cause of action that did not exist anyway. There was a real difference between negligently failing to respond to a call for emergency aid and intentionally failing to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was killed while an inmate at a correctional institution. The decedent was mentally ill, and the complaint alleged that the correctional officers failed to properly treat his mental illness. This allegedly led to an incident where the decedent was killed by officers trying to subdue him. The first challenged count alleged that the correctional officers had lied about a prior incident involving another mentally ill inmate. The court found that the officers had no duty to the decedent to tell the truth about this incident. Since the administrator had standing to allege a failure to properly supervise employees, and since another challenged count was not duplicative of other counts, it was properly included. Finally, the correctional officers argued that three counts should have been dismissed since they alleged violations of the Patients' Bill of Rights, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 17a-540 to 17a-550. The court ruled that the Patients' Bill of Rights included department of correction facilities, and that the fact that inmates could be deprived of certain privileges did not invalidate the other portions of the Patients' Bill of Rights which did apply to inmates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff arrestee sued defendants, a city and its former police chief (city defendants), and defendant police officers, seeking money damages for personal injuries and emotional distress he allegedly suffered when the officers used unreasonable force in his unlawful arrest and detention. The city defendants moved to strike counts six and 10, which alleged that the city defendants violated Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 7, 8, 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city defendants argued that governmental immunity protected them and that there was no recognized cause of action for money damages under the state constitution against a municipality or a supervisor for a police officer's unconstitutional conduct. The arrestee argued for the right to pursue a state Bivens cause of action against the city defendants. The trial court found that a damages claim against the city defendants would have chilled the zeal with which governmental functions were undertaken and would have hindered the deterrent effects of the Bivens remedy by allowing claimants to sue a city and its officials instead of the offending officers. Moreover, common law and statutory remedies provided the arrestee adequate means of redress. The arrestee simply failed to allege sufficient facts to support his constitutional cause of action against the city defendants. Although the arrestee also contended that the city defendants were liable for the inadequate training and supervision of the officers, such activity involved discretionary governmental acts for which the city defendants enjoyed governmental immunity absent allegations of malice, wantonness, or intentional conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In the interest of the public, the state's motion to vacate the family support magistrate's determination that General Statutes &sect; 46b-172(a)(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional, granted.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State, on behalf of plaintiff mother, moved to vacate a decision by the Connecticut Family Support Magistrate Division which declared Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-172(a)(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The family support magistrate had rendered a decision granting defendant alleged father's motion for genetic testing asserting that portions of &sect; 46b-172(a)(1) violated the separation of powers doctrine in the paternity and child support action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged father, who the court later determined lacked capacity, executed an acknowledgment of paternity. The State then commenced a support petition. The appellate court decided to address the magistrate's constitutional ruling even though the issue was moot based upon the public interest in avoiding future challenges to &sect; 46b-172(a)(1)'s constitutionality. The appellate court held the Connecticut Family Support Magistrate Division was a creature of statute and not a constitutional court. Thus, the magistrate did not have the authority to address the issue of the facial constitutionality of &sect; 46b-172(a)(1). Moreover, the necessity of the situation before the magistrate was insufficient to require the magistrate to address the constitutional question. The magistrate should have sustained the State's objection to the motion for genetic testing and directed the alleged father to file the requisite motion to open and set aside the judgment. Despite that, the magistrate held a full evidentiary hearing on the issue of capacity, and the issue was ultimately resolved on grounds other than the constitutional claim, to which the State did not object. Thus, the issue was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the issue was moot, due to the likelihood of future challenges to the statute's constitutionality, the appellate court found that vacatur was appropriate with respect to the magistrate's constitutional determination. Accordingly, in the interest of the public, the State's motion to vacate the family support magistrate's determination that the statute was unconstitutional was granted.</SPAN></P>
