</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father reasserted the arguments he made in his original petition before the court of appeals, questioning whether the forum state courts had the authority to exert personal jurisdiction over non-resident fathers in adoption proceedings and whether non-resident putative fathers had a meaningful opportunity to raise jurisdictional defenses. Because the father raised these issues in the context of a petition for extraordinary relief, before reaching them, we must first determine whether the father was even entitled to receive extraordinary relief. To the extent the father attempted to cloud the issue by presenting additional jurisdictional arguments in his brief that were not raised in his petition, such arguments were not properly before this court. In his petition, the father did not describe a situation where any district court in the forum state exceeded its jurisdiction or abused its discretion. The petition did not present any circumstances suggesting that any forum state court failed to perform an act required by law. Thus, the court of appeals correctly noted that the father simply failed to take any timely action to preserve his rights to this child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss insurance fraud and theft by deception charges, as, absent his confession, there was no independent evidence that either crime actually occurred. The district court denied the motion, and defendant pled guilty to attempted insurance fraud, but reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion. On appeal, the Utah Court of Appeals reversed the denial of the motion to dismiss. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals reversed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss, as the State conceded there was insufficient evidence to convict under the corpus delicti rule. On appeal, the State argued that the corpus delicti rule should have been abandoned in favor of the trustworthiness standard, and, under that standard, sufficient evidence existed to affirm the denial of defendant's motion. The appellate court held that the corpus delicti rule failed to adequately protect the innocent person who falsely confessed to an actual crime. As a result, the court abandoned the corpus delicti rule and replaced it with the trustworthiness standard. However, the court affirmed the court of appeals' decision, as the ex post facto clause prevented application of the trustworthiness standard to defendant's case. The ex post facto clause applied, as the trustworthiness standard pertained not just to the admissibility, but also to the sufficiency of the evidence. The standard altered the sufficiency of the evidence that was required to convict under the corpus delicti rule, as it required less or different evidence than required by the corpus delicti rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to four counts of aggravated murder. During the penalty phase, he waived his right to counsel and stated that he felt the death penalty was appropriate. The District Court for the Third District, Salt Lake County, Utah, sentenced defendant to death. Though defendant did not wish to appeal, on mandatory statutory appeal, a court assistant claimed on defendant's behalf that the death sentence should be overturned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to kidnapping, sexually assaulting, and killing four women. During the penalty phase, the State presented evidence of his prior offenses, details of the murders, and the testimony of the victims' families. As mitigating evidence, defendant presented evidence of his history of blackouts, memory loss, and associative disorders. After he was sentenced to death, he attempted suicide while in prison. The supreme court held that the trial court did not err in failing to move, sua sponte, for a competency hearing early in the proceedings or in finding defendant competent at the post-sentencing competency hearing. Defendant knowingly, competently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel, and his failure to offer additional mitigating evidence did not undermine the integrity of the verdict. Any error in disqualifying defendant's original counsel was harmless, as was the trial court's decision to allow press photography during the proceedings. The trial court did not improperly admit victim impact evidence. Defendant's right to a speedy appeal had not been violated, and Utah's aggravated felony murder statute and death penalty scheme were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents, on their own behalf and on behalf of their minor child, challenged a decision of the Third District, Salt Lake (Utah), which held that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-11-24 (2002) of the Utah Wrongful Life Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 78-11-23 to -25 (2002), was constitutional and barred the parents' claims against appellee medical center for wrongful birth, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and failure to obtain consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the parents' child was born with Down Syndrome, the parents claimed that the center failed to inform them of certain test results that indicated that their child was likely to suffer from Down Syndrome, which prevented the parents from having sufficient information to determine whether or not to abort the child. The center argued that the parents' claims were barred under the Act. The trial court agreed, and the court affirmed. The court first held that the standard of review was the presumption of constitutionality, and the court overruled cases that recognized an exception to that standard, which included Hipwell v. Sharp, 858 P.2d 987 (Utah 1993), Condemarin v. Univ. Hosp., 775 P.2d 348 (Utah 1989), and Currier v. Holden, 862 P.2d 1357 (Utah Ct. App. 1993). The Act did not violate the Open Courts Clause because Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-11-24 (2002) did not abrogate an existing legal remedy. Due process was not violated because the Act did not inhibit a woman's ability to choose abortion. The parents' other claims were barred because they sought damages to compensate them for not being able to choose to abort their child, which the Act barred. The Act was deemed constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought certiorari review of the judgment of the Fourth District, American Fork (Utah), which convicted him of interfering with a peace officer seeking to effect a lawful arrest or detention, a class B misdemeanor in violation of Utah. Code Ann. &sect; 76-8-305 (1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A gang interdiction task force, wearing police badges, shirts, and hats, patrolled a carnival in order to detain and photograph gang members. Defendant stepped forward, began agitating his companions, and told the detainees that they did not have to go with the police. The officers told defendant to be quiet and step back. Defendant was arrested when he stepped forward again to encourage noncompliance. On certiorari, the court held that defendant's arrest and conviction for violating 76-8-305(3) were proper because defendant refused the requests of clearly identified police officers to refrain from impeding their efforts to effect a lawful detention of gang members. The court found that the lawfulness of the detention was irrelevant to the plain language of &sect; 76-8-305, which was only contingent on the officers acting within the scope of their authority and the detention having the indicia of being lawful. The court held that the &quot;seeking to effect a lawful detention or arrest&quot; language of &sect; 76-8-305 did not sanction unreasonable searches and seizures prohibited by the Fourth Amendment but provided for the orderly judicial resolution of disputes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The supreme court disagreed. Because the status exception extended to parental rights termination proceedings, it was irrelevant whether the mother had minimum contacts with the state. It was clear that the interests of Utah were paramount to the interests of any other state. The child was present in Utah and all relevant information concerning his welfare, progress, needs, and potential adoptive family were easily accessible there. In addition, the mother's rights were protected because she was appointed counsel, given an opportunity to present evidence, to summon witnesses, to have her rights fully and carefully considered by the trial court, and to appeal the decisions of the trial court within 30 days. Therefore, the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction over the mother.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's second trial on eight counts of aggravated burglary, defendant moved to present expert testimony concerning eyewitness identification. The State moved to admit defendant's inculpatory statements from his presentence report and sentencing hearing from the prior trial. The Third District Court, Salt Lake County (Utah), denied defendant's motion and granted the State's motion. Defendant filed an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that because the State's eyewitness identifications were critical to the State's case, the trial court erred in ruling that defendant could not present expert testimony concerning the reliability of eyewitness identification testimony. Defendant also challenged the trial court's allowing the State to admit inculpatory statements he made following his first trial in his presentence report and at the sentencing hearing. As to the admission of expert testimony, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for the admission of expert testimony. As to the admission of defendant's prior inculpatory statements, the court also held that the statements were inadmissible. The court found that, as a matter of law, disclosure of the presentence report did not satisfy the requirements of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-2-202(7), and any interest favoring access to the report by the State were outweighed by defendant's legislatively-recognized privacy interest in the records. The court also concluded that Utah R. Crim. P. 24(d) required exclusion of defendant's allocution from the State's case-in-chief in the retrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of defendant's motion for admission of expert testimony was affirmed. The trial court's decision to admit defendant's inculpatory statements from his first trial was reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had jurisdiction to try defendant on any offenses arising out of the original criminal episode. Defendant waived his right to appeal the bind-over order by not appealing it within 30 days. Regarding the admission of evidence implicating defendant in soliciting drugs, the admission of this evidence, even if improper, was harmless error.

The State filed the charges shortly after defendant turned 21. Defendant moved to dismiss the charges, contending that the district court lacked jurisdiction to try him for crimes allegedly committed as a juvenile.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the district court erred by concluding it had jurisdiction over the criminal prosecution of a person who was 21 years old or older, but who was charged with crimes allegedly committed as a juvenile. Defendant claimed that the plain language of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-104(1)(a) vested the juvenile court with exclusive, original jurisdiction over his offenses. The appellate court found that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3-4 granted the district court jurisdiction in all matters civil and criminal, not excepted in the Utah Constitution and not prohibited by law. The plain language of &sect; 78-3a-104(1)(a) did not prohibit district court jurisdiction in criminal proceedings against defendant, who was 21 years of age and older, regardless of when it was alleged defendant committed his crimes. Defendant did not direct the court to any other provision that prohibited district court jurisdiction over his criminal proceedings. The proceedings were commenced after defendant's 21 birthday, and the statutory language was unambiguous. Thus, the district court had jurisdiction over the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital technicians filed suit against appellee company, alleging illness from chemical exposure caused by the company's negligent installation and servicing of its x-ray processing machine. The Third District, Salt Lake County (Utah), excluded the technicians' expert testimony relative to the cause of their alleged illness and granted summary judgment to the company. The technicians appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the technicians argued, inter alia, that the company's installation and maintenance of the x-ray processor created a duty of care to the technicians. The appellate court held that the company had a duty of care to the technicians for the safe installation and maintenance of the x-ray processing machine and that the factual determinations supporting that duty and its breach were questions for the jury. There was no law, evidence, or stipulation indicating that the hospital's exclusive control of the ventilation system relieved the company of the duty it had undertaken to install and maintain its machine in a safe and operable condition. Therefore, the company's physical undertaking of the installation and maintenance of the x-ray machine, which it should have known was necessary for the technicians' safety, conferred a duty of reasonable care in that undertaking. Thus, a jury could find that the company breached its duty by failing to take reasonable measures to prevent chemical exposure by the technicians. There was also a triable issue as to adequate warning of the chemical exposure that gave rise to the alleged injuries. Therefore, summary judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant student, charged with criminal libel for creating an Internet web site, in the Juvenile Court, Fifth District, Beaver County (Utah), moved to dismiss. The juvenile court denied the motion and certified the order as final. He appealed to the Utah Court of Appeals, which determined the matter was appropriate for an interlocutory appeal and certified it to the instant court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 16-year-old student created an Internet web site on his home computer that included a page listing various students and purported to describe each person's sexual history. After receiving complaints, an investigation began, which led to his arrest. After being arrested and waiving his right to counsel or the presence of a parent, he admitted creating the site. In the appeal, the instant court decided only whether Utah's criminal libel statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 76-9-501, 503, was constitutional on its face. The statute was unconstitutional on its face. It did not comport with requirements laid down by the United States Supreme Court. Based upon First Amendment standards, in a civil action for libel, &quot;actual malice&quot; was required if the statement concerned a public official, whereas only negligence was required if the statement concerned a private citizen. Because &quot;actual malice&quot; was required in a civil action for libel of a public figure, and because Utah's civil and criminal libel statutes defined &quot;libel&quot; in similar terms, the trial court erroneously concluded it was appropriate to assume the criminal libel statute incorporated an &quot;actual malice&quot; fault requirement.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that (1) the trial court did not err in failing to move, sua sponte, for a competency hearing early in the proceedings or in finding defendant competent at the post-sentencing competency hearing; (2) defendant knowingly, competently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel, and his failure to offer additional mitigating evidence did not undermine the integrity of the verdict; (3) any error in disqualifying defendant's original counsel was harmless, as was the trial court's decision to allow press photography during the proceedings; (4) the trial court did not improperly admit victim impact evidence; and (5) defendant's right to a speedy appeal was not violated and Utah's aggravated felony murder statute and death penalty scheme were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals, Third District, Salt Lake (Utah), affirmed, concluding that the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence was proper. On writ of certiorari, he sought review of the court of appeals' decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for disturbing the peace, public intoxication, and interfering with a peace officer. When searched, at the jail, a small bindle of cocaine was discovered in his sock. Defendant moved to suppress the cocaine, arguing police lacked a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal behavior to stop him and therefore any evidence obtained as a result of the illegal stop must be suppressed. He also argued police arrested him without probable cause and the search-incident-to-arrest exception could not justify the subsequent jailhouse search where the cocaine was discovered. The question on certiorari review was whether the police lawfully searched defendant in a search incident to arrest. Clearly, exigent circumstances existed because defendant began to resist the officers physically and violently, placing in question their safety and threatening the physical well being of any officers holding him in custody. He was arrested, taken to jail, and searched. This was a search incident to an arrest. The officers had probable cause and statutory authorization to arrest defendant for interfering with an officer because defendant committed the offense in their presence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Utah State Tax Commission petitioned for writ of certiorari after the Utah Court of Appeals concluded that plaintiff taxpayers' case against the commission was subject to a statutory exception under which exhaustion was not required when it would result in irreparable harm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals concluded that the taxpayers were not required to exhaust their administrative remedies under the irreparable harm exception under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-46a-12.1(b)(iii). The commission argued that concluding that the taxpayers would suffer irreparable harm if required to exhaust their administrative remedies was error. The appellate court found that the commission had authority to amend or repeal the challenged rule in a manner that would moot and avoid the taxpayers' claims. The taxpayers' alternative claim challenged the commission's application of its own rules, the sort of question ideally suited to resolution by the commission. The commission's declared intent to offset the refund was merely a procedural requirement under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-12-110(2)(a) (2000). Requiring exhaustion would place no additional burden on the taxpayers as the commission would attempt to offset any refund whether the taxpayers pursued their claims administratively or in district court. The de minimis amounts of the taxpayers' potential refunds would not reduce their incentive to individually seek a refund to the point that they would be irreparably harmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners contended that Utah's multi-county signature requirement for placing an initiative on the ballot was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the uniform operation of laws provision of Utah Const. art.

The lieutenant governor argued that the requirement did not burden petitioners' equal protection rights, that the requirement was sustainable as a general initiative regulation, and that the purposes of the requirement justified it. The instant court held that the requirement constituted a violation of the Utah Constitution. The instant court's state constitutional analysis constituted an independent ground for its decision. The requirement effectively discriminated against urban voters in that it afforded the registered voters of rural counties a disproportionate amount of voting power. The requirement was not reasonably necessary to further, and did not in fact actually and substantially further, any of the proffered legislative purposes. The requirement also was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. The requirement was severable from the remainder of the statewide initiative enabling statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife, on her own behalf and that of her children, brought a wrongful death action against appellee city.

The wife challenged the constitutionality of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-2(4)(a) on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife's husband was electrocuted when irrigation pipe that he was carrying came into contact with power lines operated by the city. The wife alleged that the power lines were too low to the ground and were unsafe. The district court held that the city's operation of its municipal power system was a governmental function under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-2(4)(a), and that the city's decision to keep its power lines in that condition constituted an exercise of a discretionary function under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-10(1), an exception to the waiver for negligence. On appeal, the court reversed. The court agreed that the city's decision regarding the power lies fell within the discretionary function exception to the Act. However, the court held that the 1987 amendment to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-2(4)(a) violated Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 11 because it eliminated the wife's right to sue for her husband's wrongful death. The court found that the immunization of all municipal activities was not justified, and Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-2(4)(a) was unconstitutional as it applied to municipalities operating electrical power systems. The court remanded for a trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner individuals sought an extraordinary writ from the court containing the following relief: a declaration that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 20A-7-201(1)(a)(ii) (2001) was unconstitutional, that the Radioactive Waste Restrictions Act initiative petition was sufficient under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 20A-7-207(2) (2001), and an order directing respondent lieutenant governor to place the initiative on the 2002 general election ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals sought a declaration that that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 20A-7-201(1)(a)(ii) was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 20A-7-207(4)(a),(b)(i)-(ii) (2001) did not confer jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of the statutory scheme regulating the initiative signature process, which is what the individuals sought, and therefore it declined to consider the petition for an extraordinary writ pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 20A-7-207(4)(a),(b)(i)-(ii) (2001). The court, however, decided to treat the petition as an extraordinary writ pursuant to Utah Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3. Although an alternative legal remedy by way of a declaratory judgment action theoretically existed, the state supreme court held that it was not an adequate way to respond to the relief sought, namely, the placement of the petition on the ballot. The court noted that the individuals' claim was that they were entitled to that relief under the state and federal constitutions, and the court did not deem it adequate to deny them a hearing on that question merely because they, or someone else, could raise the same constitutional question in connection with another future ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court determined that while statutory authority did not confer jurisdiction over the questions raised, state constitutional authority did. The parties were directed to file memoranda addressing the supplemental issues raised by the court.</SPAN></P>

XI, &sect; 3. Appellants argued that the trial court erred in granting Grand County declaratory judgment that &sect; 17-2-6(2) was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that the purpose of the legislation was to provide an additional method of annexation for the cities and towns caught straddling a county line. The legislature did not arbitrarily include or exclude members from the class to which the statute was applicable, but instead, included only members to which the purpose of the statute might apply. The city was afforded no special treatment in the application of the law, and there was no indication that any other class member would be treated differently. The concurrent resolution requirement did not give the legislature and the governor the last word on county boundary changes. The trial court correctly concluded that only a majority of those voting on the annexation proposal in Emery Count and the city portion of Grand County needed to vote in favor of the annexation proposal for it to be approved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son was traveling west in his automobile. A transit authority bus was traveling east, intending to turn left. As the traffic light for east-west traffic turned yellow, the bus turned left in front of the son. The son's car struck the bus, killing him. In reducing the judgment against the transit authority, the trial court held that the transit activities were governmental, as opposed to proprietary, and fell within the scope of the Utah Governmental Immunity Act. The parents contended that the damage cap imposed by &sect; 63-30-34 violated the Utah Constitution. Alternatively, they asserted that the cap should be interpreted to allow each of them to recover $ 250,000. The instant court held that the transit authority's operation would have been considered to have been a governmental function prior to the passage of a 1987 amendment to the Act and not a proprietary function. The transit authority's liability to the parents was subject to the provisions of the Act, including its limitation on damages. The instant court upheld the validity of the statute under the Utah Constitution. Under the statute, only $ 250,000 could be awarded in toto to the parents.</SPAN></P>

The trial court correctly determined that the LRA pre-empted the common law. The economic classification within the LRA met the rational basis standard required by the Equal Protection Clause. The manufacturer cited clauses in the contract as evidencing a theory of recovery for ordinary negligence, but the manufacturer misapprehended the principles of products liability law. Finally, jury affidavits in support of the motion to amend the verdict should have been admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's holding that the tort liability statute precluded the application of the common law, but the appellate court reversed the trial court's determination on summary judgment that the asphalt company was to indemnify the manufacturer. Finally, the appellate court reversed the trial court's decision to strike juror affidavits, and remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>

The Sixth District, Sanpete County (Utah), tried the defendant in a courtroom located inside the prison facility; he was convicted and sentenced to death. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was in prison when he was charged with the killing of a fellow prisoner. The defendant's trial was held in the prison. None of the jurors who were selected to sit on the jury expressed reservations about the location of the trial. Two jurors were removed from the panel after their juror questionnaires revealed that they had reservations about imposing the death penalty. The state supreme court held that, as no jurors expressed reservations about the location, the defendant was not prejudiced by being tried in prison. The court also rejected the defendant's claim that his right to a public trial was violated, as the public had access to view the proceedings. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding certain jurors who had reservations about imposing the death penalty, as it also excluded jurors who seemed too eager to impose the death penalty. The trial court's failure to instruct the jury on manslaughter was a harmless error, as the defendant was convicted of aggravated murder over murder. A videotape of the murder and autopsy photographs were properly admitted, as the prejudicial effect of the items did not outweigh their probative value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from the denial by the Third District Court, Salt Lake, Utah, of a subsequent petition for post-conviction relief, and claimed: (1) the issues warranted review because of unusual circumstances; (2) Utah's burglary statute was unconstitutionally vague; (3) he was denied the right to represent himself; and (4) was deprived of effective assistance of counsel at trial and on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Utah held that plaintiff did not articulate any unusual circumstances other than noting that the errors committed below were obvious and involved the denial of substantial constitutional rights. His constitutional claims, with respect to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-6-202(1) and self-representation, were therefore procedurally barred. However, under Utah's Post-Conviction Relief Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-35a-104(1)(d) (1996), a petitioner might have raised the issues he failed to raise on direct appeal through an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal, if he was represented by the same counsel during both phases of the criminal proceedings. When trial counsel represented defendant on appeal, an ineffective assistance claim cannot be raised, as it is unreasonable to expect trial counsel to raise the issue of her own ineffectiveness at trial on direct appeal. Plaintiff's request for court-appointed counsel went beyond mere acquiescence and simple cooperation. He waived his right to claim that counsel was ineffective when she did not raise his right to self-representation and failed to challenge the Utah burglary statute on vagueness grounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of the petition for post-conviction relief was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was in prison when he was charged with the killing of a fellow prisoner. The defendant's trial was held in the prison. The decision to have the defendant's trial in prison was based on security risks particular to defendant, defendant's criminal history, defendant's prison disciplinary record and prison history, and the security risks associated with trying the case in the two other courtrooms in the county. The defendant's trial in prison did not violate his right to a fair trial or impermissibly impinge upon the presumption of innocence given that he was in prison when the murder occurred and those facts would come out at trial. The trial court's failure to instruct the jury on manslaughter was a harmless error given that the jury convicted the defendant of aggravated murder over murder. The Utah Constitution did not require sentences imposed by juries to be unanimous.  Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-207 (1999) did not violate ex post facto prohibitions where the statute did not change the measure of punishment available to a defendant convicted of aggravated murder, but rather, allowed a life sentence without parole to be imposed by a less than a unanimous jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insureds filed a claim with the insurer after their hot water heater caused property damage to their home. The district court dismissed the insureds' claims after the insurer invoked the appraisal clause of the policy. The parties were unable to determine the scope of the appraisal, so the insureds' filed a declaratory relief action regarding the scope of the appraisal and asserted extra-contractual and other claims. An appraisal panel resolved the contractual claims, but it refused to consider the extra-contractual claims. The state supreme court held it had jurisdiction, as the insureds timely filed the notice of appeal after the denial of the motion to confer on the forum and schedule for resolving the extra-contractual claims. The Utah Constitution guaranteed the insureds the right to have their extra-contractual claims litigated. In the first sui, the district court could only compel appraisal of the contractual claim and erred by dismissing the extra-contractual claims under the appraisal clause. Res judicata did not bar the extra-contractual claim in the second action, as there was no adjudication on the merits of the extra-contractual claim in the first action.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Utah's aggravated murder statute, the sufficiency of the evidence introduced at trial to support his conviction, and the trial judge's weighing of the aggravating and mitigating factors in sentencing him to death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brutally killed and attempted to rape the victim. The defendant was also charged with sexually abusing his daughter during the commission of the crime. The defendant asserted that the aggravated murder statute was unconstitutional because it overlapped with the felony murder statute. The appellate court held that while both statutes have rape as a statutory element, they have different mens rea and outline different crimes. The other challenges to the statute were dismissed. The court was not required to evaluate the proportionality of the sentence, but held the sentence was not invidiously imposed against Hopi Indians and that the level of culpability was proportionate to the sentence. Sufficient evidence existed for a conviction of aggravated murder, as the defendant admitted to aggravated burglary, and the victim may have been raped before she died. The trial judge was allowed to consider factors during sentencing other than those proven at trial; thus, the court properly considered the defendant's sexual abuse of a child as an aggravating factor even though the jury found the defendant was not in engaged in the sexual abuse of a child when the murder was committed.</SPAN></P>

The majority of defendant's claims were procedurally barred. Issues raised in an amicus brief were barred because defendant specifically adopted them in his second petition. There were no unusual circumstances justifying defendant's failure to raise claims that should have been argued on direct appeal. The remainder of the claims were properly dismissed on their merits. Misconduct by jury in consulting a dictionary was harmless. Defendant failed to show prejudice from mental heath expert's failure to disclose prior involvement with case. Defendant failed to show there was other mitigation evidence that a conflict-free expert would have discovered. Retroactive application of Menzies did not result in a substantial injustice. Allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel were without merit. Trial counsel's performance in passing a juror for cause was not outside realm of appropriate trial strategy. There was no support for the claim that the prosecution withheld any evidence.</SPAN></P>

Although the initial investigation of the accident supported differing conclusions as to whom caused the accident, a consensus was reached early on by the investigators and witnesses that an unsafe pass by plaintiff insured's car caused the crash.

The jury issued an award an of $ 145 million in punitive damages and the trial court ordered a remittitur. On review, the appellate court determined that the remittitur order was not appropriate. Under both Federal law and Utah law, the award of punitive damages was proper. The trial court's award of attorney fees and litigation expenses were correct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the defendant's first appeal from his sentence enhancement, the supreme court held that Utah Code &sect; 76-3-203.1 was unconstitutional in part, ruling that, while the gang enhancement statute provided that the determination of its applicability was to be made by the trial court judge, that determination must be made, instead, by the fact finder. The defendant argued that the trial court erred: (1) because his guilty pleas for murder were entirely conditioned on the outcome of his first appeal; and (2) his pleas were not knowingly and voluntarily entered. The supreme court held that the trial court had not erred because: (1) there was no suggestion in the trial court's colloquy that the defendant made each plea conditional while preserving only the gang enhancement issue for appeal, rather, he entered a conditional plea only as to the gang enhancement portion of the crime; and (2) the plea colloquy demonstrated clearly that the defendant was provided with the two possible results of entering his pleas, namely, that he might or might not be able to withdraw his pleas after a successful appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff newspaper sought a declaratory judgment as to the meaning and enforceability of three agreements between defendant publisher and defendant management company. The management company moved for change of venue which was denied. The management company then filed a petition for writ of mandamus directing the district court judge to transfer venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper's claims against the publisher were contractual, based on the written joint operating agreement (JOA). The newspaper's claims against the management company were for tortious interference via manipulation of the management and option agreements with the newspaper's rights under the JOA. There was no contractual relationship between the newspaper and the management company. The relationship between the publisher and the management company was one of principal-agent. Both the management company and the publisher had their corporate residence in another county. The state supreme court found that: (1) Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-13-7 was the venue statute that applied to the newspaper's action against the management company; and (2) the general rule of venue based upon a defendant's residence should have prevailed where differing venue provisions applied to multiple defendants.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff also alleged that several state government officials, state government entities, and attorneys involved in the underlying class action lawsuit, of which he contended his daughter was a member, were somehow responsible for, at least in part, the girl's death. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Utah held: (1) all of the state defendants, except the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS) were appropriately dismissed because plaintiff failed to provide them with notice of his claim as required by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-12; (2) the complaint against the monitoring panel defendants was also barred since they had judicial immunity from suit; (3) it was not error to dismiss the attorney defendants; (4) it was not error to grant summary judgment in favor of DCFS; and (5) the attorney defendants were entitled to reasonable attorney fees on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed the district court's dismissal of Nebeker's petition for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Further, while the Tax Commission erroneously applied the doctrine of res judicata, we affirmed its dismissal of Nebeker's application on the grounds the Tax Commission lacked jurisdiction to review the constitutional issues. Nevertheless, having failed to raise those constitutional issues in the initial assessment proceeding, we conclude, based on the policy reasons above, Nebeker waived the right to bring those issues later before a tribunal with jurisdiction over such claims. Finally, the Tax Commission did not violate the principle of judicial estoppel by arguing res judicata before the Tax Commission.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellee Utah State Tax Commission determined that appellant trucking company was deficient in payment of the Utah special fuel tax and imposed a twelve percent interest rate on the amount it owed. The company filed suit against the Commission alleging the interest rate imposed violated the Utah Constitution. The Uintah County Court, Eighth Judicial District (Utah) dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals addressed, inter alia: (1) whether the district court erred in dismissing the company's petition; and (2) whether the Commission erred in ruling that the company's action was barred by res judicata. The court of appeals held: (1) that the district court had not erred because while administrative agencies do not generally determine the constitutionality of their organic legislation, the mere introduction of a constitutional issue did not obviate the need for exhaustion of administrative remedies, and here, the company could have petitioned the Commission for a redetermination of its tax deficiency; and (2) that the Commission had erred because the Commission could have resolved the dispute on other grounds, nullifying the need to address the constitutional claims at all. Nevertheless, the constitutional challenge was the sole claim brought before the Commission in the second proceeding. Because the issue was not within the Commission's jurisdiction, the Commission should have dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The district court held that it lacked jurisdiction. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling regarding jurisdiction, but vacated the convictions on other grounds. The State petitioned for certiorari. The state supreme court found that &sect; 77-13-6(2)(b) was ambiguous as to the term &quot;entry of the plea.&quot; Construing the purpose of the statute to prevent lengthy delays and avoid serious problems, the state supreme court held that the time limit for filing motions to withdraw guilty pleas ran from the date of entry of a final judgment. In doing so, it specifically overruled its prior decision in State v. Price, 837 P.2d 578 (Utah Ct. App. 1992). Defendant's motion was timely made after the final entry of sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this condemnation proceeding, appellant city claimed the Fifth District Court, Washington County (Utah) erred in denying its motion to set aside severance damages or, in the alternative, for a new trial. Appellee landowners cross-appealed an order ruling that interest on the jury award must be based on simple interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city instituted a condemnation proceeding to obtain perpetual easements and rights-of-way on the landowners's properties. The trial court erred by allowing the landowners to testify to highest and best use because the landowners did not lay a foundation establishing their expertise. The landowners's opinion that the land's highest and best use was residential directly conflicted with the opinion of those witnesses who were qualified by the trial court as experts. The trial court's error prejudiced the city by presenting the jury with an inadmissible basis on which to assess the value of the land. These estimates provided the only support for the severance damage verdicts. The trial court's prejudgment interest ruling was correct.  Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-34-9 (1996) stated that interest should be awarded at a rate of eight percent per annum, not eight percent per annum, compounded annually.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded. The trial court's erroneous admission of the landowners's highest and best use testimony directly undermined confidence in the verdict. The trial court properly ordered the prejudgment interest to be calculated simply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed dismissal of his complaint seeking statutory damages against defendant judge for her allegedly wrongful refusal of plaintiff's extraordinary writ petitions. Plaintiff filed suit pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-35-1, requesting that defendant pay him the fine provided by that statute. The district court dismissed plaintiff's complaint. The appellate court affirmed. Section 78-35-1 provided that any judge who wrongfully and willfully refused to allow a proper application for writ of habeas was required to forfeit and pay a sum not exceeding $ 5,000 to the party thereby aggrieved. As a judge was a governmental employee, the notice of claim provision of Utah's Governmental Immunity Act applied to this action.  Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-11(2) (Supp. 2000) required plaintiff to file a written notice of claim with the entity before maintaining an action. Plaintiff's failure to file a notice of claim deprived the court of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife sued defendant husband, seeking to establish an unsolemnized marriage, obtain a divorce, and divide marital assets. Defendant, however, delayed in providing discovery and also refused to approve plaintiff's prepared findings of fact and conclusions of law. As defendant did not file an objection, the trial court finally entered its findings specifying the date the parties' unsolemnized marriage had ended. Defendant moved for relief from judgment, claiming the court lacked jurisdiction because its order establishing a common law marriage was not entered within one year following the termination of the parties' relationship. The district court granted defendant's motion. However, when the appellate court reversed, defendant appealed. The state supreme court agreed with the appellate court. There was sufficient evidence that the parties held themselves out and had a reputation as husband and wife. Finally, plaintiff filed her action to establish an unsolemnized marriage two months after the termination of the relationship, well within the statutory one year period for establishing an unsolemnized marriage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee brought an action against the appellant to establish an unsolemnized marriage. Appellant brought a motion to dismiss, which was denied, and subsequently filed a second motion to dismiss based on the trial court's first ruling. The Third District Court, Salt Lake County (Utah) denied both motions to dismiss. Appellant filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant claimed in his first motion to dismiss that the appellee's claim was not adjudicated within one year as set forth in Utah Code &sect; 30-1-4.5. The trial court denied the motion, ruling that the one-year adjudication requirement was unconstitutional, contrary to public policy, and unenforceable because of basic equity concerns and considerations. Appellant then filed a second motion to dismiss, arguing that the trial court held the statute unconstitutional in its entirety and that the one-year adjudication requirement was not severable from the rest of the statute. The trial court also denied the second motion. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the statute and case law required only the filing of a petition for adjudication of marriage within one year after the termination of the relationship, therefore the constitutional, policy, and equitable concerns raised by the trial court's order were moot. Furthermore, because the trial court's ruling that the statute was unconstitutional was moot, the appellant's second motion to dismiss was also moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs had asserted that defendant county violated its development code by (1) failing to issue a certificate of zoning compliance, (2) failing to issue a building permit before defendant railroad company began construction of a building, (3) concluding the facility was a permitted use, and (4) failing to order defendant railroad company to cease work on and operations of the facility after becoming aware it was being constructed without a permit. The court reversed summary judgment on that claim, instructing the court of appeals to remand to the trial court, to determine whether the facility was an accessory use thus authorized under the code. Inter alia, the court explained that defendant county had issued a certificate of zoning compliance in the form of a letter from the planning commission chairman, and it had no duty to issue a permit, as there was no permit application. Also, the court affirmed: (1) reversal of the nuisance per se finding; (2) reversal of summary judgment on plaintiffs' due process claim; (3) denial of fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988; (4) reversal of summary judgment on the PMA claim; and (5) reversal of the trial court's denial of the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a group of landowners, filed an inverse condemnation action against appellee state department of transportation. The case settled before trial, but the question of attorney fees was left open. The district court denied appellants' motion for an award of attorney fees. On appeal, appellants relied upon both federal and state law for their contention that they were entitled to fees. The supreme court reversed. Under the Uniform Relocation Assistance Real Property Acquisition Procedures Act, a property owner was to be reimbursed for reasonable attorney fees in an inverse condemnation proceeding, if the owner prevailed or if the agency effected a settlement. By virtue of the Utah Administrative Code, appellee had adopted wholesale, as the law of the state, the federal regulations implemented pursuant to the uniform act. Although nominally an executive agency, appellee was not constitutionally prohibited, as an administrative body, from making or adopting such rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school boards association sued appellee state board of education and alleged the Utah Charter Schools Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 53A-1a-501 to 53A-1a-514 (Act), was unconstitutional. The Act authorized the creation of up to eight charter schools in Utah for a three-year pilot program. The charter schools were deemed to be part of the state's public education system and were aimed at improving and customizing public education programs. Appellant challenged the Act on the grounds the state legislature could only authorize appellee to act for the whole public education system. Appellant claimed the Act violated the Utah Constitution because it granted appellee local and specific controls. Appellee's summary judgment motion arguing the Act was constitutional was granted. Appellant challenged that holding. The court affirmed. Utah Const. art. X, &sect; 3 vested general control and supervision of the public education system in appellee to direct and manage in accordance with the legislature's laws. The Act did not violate the laws, but constitutionally established charter schools for appellee to direct and manage to improve and customize public education in Utah.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the District of Utah certified a question regarding the Due Process Clause of the Utah Constitution, Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and the Open Education Clause of the Utah Constitution, Utah Const. art. X, &sect; 1, in a case involving plaintiff's state constitutional and damages claims against defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought an action against defendants in federal district court, seeking monetary damages for defendants' alleged violations of the Due Process Clause of the Utah Constitution, Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and the Open Education Clause of the Utah Constitution, Utah Const. art. X, &sect; 1. Thereafter, the federal district court certified the following question to the state supreme court: whether the Open Education Clause and the Due Process Clause were self-executing constitutional provisions that could be directly enforced without implementing legislation. The state supreme court held, first, that both clauses were self-executing, because both clauses were mandatory and prohibitory, and both clauses had already been defined and enforced without implementing legislation? Second, both clauses could be enforced through a private suit for damages if: (1) there was a flagrant violation of plaintiff's constitutional rights; (2) if existing remedies did not redress plaintiff's injuries; and (3) if equitable relief was wholly inadequate to protect plaintiff's rights or redress her injuries. A trial on the merits could be held only if plaintiff met the foregoing requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both the Due Process and Open Education Clauses of the Utah Constitution were self-executing clauses that were capable of being enforced without implementing legislation. However, plaintiff would only be allowed to maintain a private suit for damages if her rights had been flagrantly violated, if her injuries had not been redressed by existing remedies, and if equitable relief proved to be wholly inadequate.</SPAN></P>

VIII.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State filed a complaint seeking to enforce a notice and order for violations of state asbestos regulations, which plaintiff alleged had become final as a result of defendant trustee's failure to respond. The trial court agreed the defendant trustee had failed to respond to the notice and order properly delivered by the State, such that summary judgment was granted for plaintiff. Subsequently, the trial court assessed a penalty of $ 23,000 against defendants for the violations. Defendants appealed the grant of summary judgment as well as the amount of the fine, contending that such amount violated the Excessive Fines Clause of U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The court affirmed. The court concluded that summary judgment was proper because it was factually undisputed that defendant trustee had failed to promptly respond to the notice and order. The court also concluded that the fine imposed was not grossly disproportional to the gravity of the offense, such that it did not violate the Excessive Fines Clause. It was found that the fine was within the limits set by the legislature, and was reasonable considering the seriousness of defendant trustee's actions.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court sustained the constitutionality of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-23-104 (1999), which authorized checkpoints, but determined that the particular checkpoint under scrutiny was not properly authorized under its provisions. The court also held that the evidence obtained against defendant must be excluded because of the illegal checkpoint. Accordingly, the court reversed the decision of the district court denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

The intervenor then moved for summary judgment on the ground that the petitioner failed to complete adjudication of her petition within the statutory one-year time period. The trial court granted the motion. Reversing, the appellate court held that the statute required only that an action to determine or establish a marriage be commenced within a year of the termination of the relationship. The court also ruled that the trial court did not err in permitting the intervenor to intervene. The appellate court directed the trial court to apply, on remand, a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof to establish a marriage under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, municipality, mall owner, and institution, entered into agreements whereby defendant municipality agreed to provide certain financial incentives to defendants in exchange for certain improvements that would help preserve the sales tax base represented by the mall, on which defendant city heavily relied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner counties petitioned for writ of review, challenging respondent Utah State Tax Commission's (Commission) determination that intangible property, intangible value, and intangibles are synonymous for tax purposes under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-2-1101(2)(g). Cross-petitioner taxpayer telecommunications company petitioned for writ of review of respondent Commission's decision subjecting property to central assessment on unitary basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cross-petitioner taxpayer telecommunications company sought review of respondent Utah State Tax Commission's decision subjecting its property to central assessment on a unitary basis for tax purposes, employing cost-yield capitalization to value tangible property, and gross book value to calculate the taxable value of its property. Petitioner counties challenged respondent's determination that intangible property, intangible value, and intangibles are synonymous for tax purposes under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-2-1101(2)(g), which exempts intangible property from taxation. Petitioners also sought review of respondent's ruling that privilege tax does not apply to intangibles. Judgment was affirmed. Cross-petitioner failed to demonstrate that respondent's evidence, supporting its contention that cross-petitioner was asset-based and centrally assessed, was insufficient. The enhanced unitary value of cross-petitioner's property was not a tax-exempt intangible. The privilege tax was inapplicable to cross-petitioner's intangible property; it was prohibited to tax intangible property, but only income from such property. Such taxation would constitute unconstitutional double taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent tax commission's ruling was upheld. Property assessment for tax purposes by unitary method bore constitutionally sufficient rational relationship to legitimate state purpose of assuring that each property was accountable for pro rata share of burden of local government. Cross-petitioner failed to demonstrate insufficiency of evidence supporting respondent's finding that it is an asset-based, centrally assessed taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant on several drug charges. Following a hearing, the trial court ordered forfeiture of appellant's property. On appeal, appellant argued that forfeiture violated constitutional prohibitions against excessive fines. The court reversed the judgment because findings of the trial court were not sufficient to support forfeiture. The court noted that appellant's drug operation was small, involving possession of less than two pounds of marijuana for sale in an 18 month span. Further, the court noted that the trial court placed too much reliance on the maximum penalties in its analysis of proportionality instead of focusing on actual fines and penalties imposed. Finally, the court concluded that when the value of the forfeited real property was compared with (1) gravity of appellant's conduct (2) actual fines, surcharges, and penalties, and (3) appellant's probation on the prison and jail sentences, there was gross disproportionality and forfeiture could not be sustained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment because, even assuming the house was an instrumentality of appellant's drug offenses, the second prong of the excessive fine analysis was not met.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fire chief ran a red light enroute to a fire. Plaintiffs' minor children were injured when their car collided with defendant chief. Plaintiff parents sued defendant chief, defendant fire department, and defendant county.

Defendant district cross-appealed the trial court's denial of its motions for summary judgment and j.n.o.v. on the ground that it was entitled to complete immunity for fire fighting activities. On appeal, the court concluded that under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6-14, defendant chief had the privilege of running the red light only if he slowed down as necessary for safe operation, and that this presented a factual question for the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner slipped on ice an injured his back in 1990 in the course of his employment. Petitioner applied for and received temporary total disability benefits under workers' compensation law. Respondent workers' compensation fund paid for three back surgeries. The first two were temporarily successful and petitioner was able to return to work. The third surgery in 1996 was unsuccessful. After final attempts at rehabilitation and reemployment, petitioner took medical retirement and applied for permanent total disability benefits. The Utah Labor Commission (Commission) ruled that because petitioner had not filed an application for hearing or an application for preservation of rights within six years of his injury, his claim for permanent total disability benefits was barred by the statute of limitations. The court reversed, holding that petitioner's initial application for temporary benefits satisfied the &quot;application for hearing&quot; requirement of the statute of limitations and invoked the Commission's continuing jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner telecommunications service provider sought review pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-2-2 (3)(e)(i) of an order of respondent Utah Public Service Commission which denied a requested increase in telephone rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, public utility company providing telecommunications services, petitioned respondent Utah Public Service Commission for a rate increase. Respondent denied the petition because it apportioned profits from petitioner's telephone directory business to petitioner and determined petitioner was entitled to a much lower rate increase. Pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-2-2(3)(e)(i), petitioner challenged that decision, arguing the directory business was not a utility operation and was, therefore, outside respondent's jurisdiction. The court found that since the directory business was originally part of petitioner's original company, which was a utility monopoly, since respondent never acknowledged the validity of petitioner's transfer of the directory business to a non-utility company, and since respondent's jurisdiction extended to utility assets, it could choose its remedy for a transfer of those assets to a purportedly unregulated affiliate. The court agreed that petitioner failed to meet its burden of contesting respondent's remedy and upheld the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was upheld; the court found respondent properly denied petitioner's rate increase where petitioner failed to meet its burden of contesting respondent's regulatory remedy (apportioning profits from petitioner's telephone directory business to petitioner) for transfer of utility assets to its telephone directory business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of forgery and theft by deception.

The court held that defendant failed to show a manifest injustice. Even though the instruction incorrectly informed the jury that it was the defendant's burden to produce evidence of honest belief, the State, in fact, had produced in its case-in-chief sufficient evidence of a lack of honest belief to send the theft by deception charge to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of a denial entered by the First District, Brigham City Department (Utah), of his petition for extraordinary relief against respondents, a city, a county, and a justice court judge. The petition requested that the lower court declare void all of the judge's rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After petitioner pleaded not guilty to a citation for, inter alia, excessive dogs or cats on his property, petitioner was granted a motion to disqualify the sitting county justice court judge. Respondent judge was appointed as a temporary justice court judge and granted a motion to disqualify petitioner's counsel. Thereafter, petitioner filed his request for extraordinary relief, claiming that respondent judge was never officially appointed and, thus, all his previous rulings were invalid. Within a week, respondent judge was officially appointed as a temporary justice court judge. The county complied with Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78A-7-208 (2008) as respondent judge was already serving as a permanent justice court judge in the same district and no time limits on the appointment had to be specified; the appointment could be revoked when respondent judge's service was no longer required. However, respondent judge's rulings were void because, as petitioner had objected to respondent judge's authority, there was no ratification of respondent judge's actions in the case under the de facto judge doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appointment of respondent judge as a temporary justice court judge for the county. However, respondent judge's orders prior to his appointment were void, and the denial of the petition in that regard was reversed. The court noted that petitioner suffered no prejudice and that his criminal case could proceed before respondent judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Second District, Farmington Department, Utah, denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence of child pornography that the police found on his laptop computer. Defendant was subsequently convicted of three counts of sexual exploitation of a minor, each a second degree felony under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5a-3(1)(a), (2) (Supp. 2010). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant reported that his laptop was stolen. While waiting for defendant to arrive at the station to retrieve his stolen laptop, an officer discovered child pornography on the computer. When defendant arrived at the station, the officer asked defendant for his consent to search the laptop, which defendant voluntarily gave. Although the consent was granted almost immediately after an illegal search concluded, defendant's lack of awareness of the initial search reduced the significance of temporal proximity. Also, there were no mitigating intervening circumstances, but the officer's conduct involved a negligent rather than a purposeful or flagrant violation of defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. The officer's acts, therefore, did not rise to the level where the need for deterrence required suppression of the evidence uncovered in the subsequent consensual search. The trial court correctly concluded that the evidence obtained from defendant's computer was not obtained by exploitation of the initial illegal search because his consent was sufficiently separate from that search to purge any resulting taint. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sixth District, Panguitch Department, Utah, denied defendant's motion to suppress. The jury found him guilty of distribution of a controlled substance with prior convictions, possession of a controlled substance in a drug-free zone, and possession of drug paraphernalia in a drug-free zone under Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 58-37-8(1) (Supp. 2010), 58-37-8(2), and 58-37a-5(1). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff was aware of statements from multiple witnesses about defendant's use and distribution of methamphetamine; some of those statements the sheriff had received directly, while other statements had been relayed to him by other officers. Thus, under the collective knowledge doctrine, the sheriff had probable cause to support defendant's arrest. Further, because there was sufficient communication and coordination for the collective knowledge doctrine to apply, the probable cause known to the sheriff was properly imputed to the deputy. Thus, there was probable cause to justify defendant's arrest by the deputy. Because the arrest was within constitutional bounds under the Fourth Amendment, the ensuing search incident to defendant's arrest was proper, even though it occurred before a search warrant was granted. Thus, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. Because defendant made no motion under Utah R. App. P. 11(h) to supplement the record by including the excluded jury voir dire, defendant failed to provide an adequate record on appeal, and the appellate court had to assume the regularity of the proceedings in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The tenant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that while fair market value based on the property's highest and best use was one method for calculating rental adjustments, there was no term in the lease that expressly prohibited SITLA from calculating the rental rate based upon other criteria. SITLA's role as the trustee of the school trust funds did not give it an absolute right to obtain full value for the trust property, if to do so would infringe upon the preexisting contractual rights of third parties. Under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 53C-1-302, SITLA had some flexibility to vary from the fair market value if doing so would be consistent with the balancing of short-term and long-term interests of the state. Utah Admin. Code r. R850-30-400(5) did not require that the rent be adjusted based on fair market value. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment to SITLA on the tenant's claim for breach of the covenant. The tenant could not show that SITLA breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment or that it was constructively evicted. The tenant's inverse condemnation claim was precluded. The tenant would be entitled to general and, if appropriate, consequential damages proximately caused by the breach.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision granting summary judgment to SITLA on the tenant's claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing was reversed; the judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed a petition for extraordinary relief. The trial court dismissed the petition as frivolous and denied his request for quo warranto relief.

Further, there was no evidence in the record that the inmate failed to receive procedural due process at his parole hearing. The Board provided the inmate with notice of the hearing and a copy of the documents it planned to rely on at the hearing. The trial court properly dismissed the inmate's claims related to his inability to participate in sex offender therapy. The Utah probation and parole statute was not unconstitutional because it required an inmate to admit guilt prior to being admitted into certain sex therapy programs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth District, Fillmore Department, Utah, convicted defendant for securities fraud, a violation of the Utah Uniform Securities Act (Securities Act), Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 61-1-1 to -30 (2006 &amp; Supp. 2009). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that because the same issues were already issued by the original appeal, defendant was not required to file a second notice of appeal for the appellate court to have jurisdiction. The original appeal included restitution. Defendant argued that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 61-1-1 did not apply because the transfer of assets was not for value. The appellate court found that the transfer of the farm assets from the limited liability company to the corporation conferred indirect benefits that included an enhanced ability to borrow and raise capital. The farm was worth at least $10,000. Any error in the admission of the State's expert's testimony was not prejudicial as defendant was able to cross-examine the expert and he called his own securities expert to rebut the State's expert's testimony. The instructions required the jury to find that a predicate statement was made and the record supported the jury's finding that such predicate statements were made. Utah Code Ann. &sect; 61-1-1(2) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. The jury was properly instructed on reliance. The restitution order did not address credits received by the farmers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner did not dispute that during the years in question she was a resident of Utah, she was employed in Utah, and she had earnings. She also did not dispute that she failed to file tax returns for the years in question. Finally, she did not dispute the accuracy of the income information relied upon in the audits issued by the Commission. Petitioner claimed that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to collect income tax from Utah residents. The court concluded that petitioner's arguments were without merit. Although framed as a challenge to the Utah income tax, petitioner's arguments had been frequently raised by those protesting the federal income tax. To the extent that petitioner's arguments pertained only to the validity of the federal income tax, they were irrelevant to her challenge to Utah's income tax. If petitioner was claiming that the United States Constitution prohibited any state from imposing a state income tax, she was doing nothing more than rephrase frequently rejected arguments leveled at the federal income tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Seventh District, Monticello Department, Utah, denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a traffic stop, defendant entered a conditional guilty plea to possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute and possession of drug paraphernalia. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of an unjustified police detention. The appellate court agreed, finding that the officer asserted two justifications for stopping defendant: defendant's driving pattern (bumping the white fog line especially when cars were passing) and defendant's failure to display a valid license plate. However, the video showed that defendant's driving pattern did not provide the officer with reasonable suspicion of improper lane travel sufficient to justify initiation of the traffic stop. And the asserted justification for the traffic stop that there was no visible license plate was dispelled when the officer exited his vehicle and saw a temporary permit while approaching the vehicle. Even according to the officer's own statement, before he reached the vehicle's window he no longer had reasonable articulable suspicion that defendant was committing a traffic offense. Because this interaction was not a consensual encounter, and the officer no longer had any reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity, his actions exceeded the limits of a lawful investigative detention.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that because defendant was, in essence, challenging the validity of his aggravated assault by a prisoner conviction rather than the legality of his sentence, his challenge was beyond the scope of Rule 22(e).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his sentence was illegal because he was sentenced by a judge who engaged in unconstitutional judicial fact finding. Defendant claimed that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-201(7) (2003) (repealed 2007) was unconstitutional because it permitted judicial fact finding. The appellate court found that because &sect; 76-3-201(7) permitted judicial fact finding only to alter the indeterminate minimum term and did not permit elevation of the fixed maximum term, the statute was held to be constitutional. There was no constitutional prohibition on judicial fact finding to impose a lower minimum term in an indeterminate sentencing scheme. Defendant's claims relating to the district court's denial of his postjudgment motions at the September 2005 resentencing hearing were barred by res judicata. Defendant's argument challenging the legality of his sentence was a collateral attack on the validity of his conviction and was improperly presented as a Utah R. Crim. P. 22(e) motion to correct an illegal sentence. Because it was impossible for defendant to receive a more favorable sentence, the fact that he did not receive the assistance of counsel at his resentencing hearing was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Third District, West Jordan Department, Utah, based upon guilty pleas to attempted possession of a controlled substance and driving under the influence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After sentencing, defendant challenged the voluntariness of his guilty plea and claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective. A motion to withdraw a guilty plea had to be disposed of prior to sentencing; however, defendant contended that due process and equal protection guarantees precluded the application of the jurisdictional bar. He argued that it was impossible to determine that his counsel was ineffective and his plea was involuntary until after sentencing, and that he could not appear in post-conviction proceedings as a result of his deportation. The Court of Appeals of Utah disagreed rejected his constitutional challenges to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-13-6 (2008). The statutory scheme satisfied due process by allowing a defendant to challenge the validity of the guilty plea either before sentencing or in post-conviction proceedings. Defendant had an equal opportunity to avoid whatever disadvantages might attend post-conviction proceedings by moving to withdraw his guilty plea within the statutory period. He had the same remedies available to any other defendant who pleaded guilty. Thus, he could not escape application of the jurisdictional bar.</SPAN></P>

P. 65B in the Third District Court, Silver Summit Department (Utah), seeking relief from an alleged wrongful restraint on his personal liberty and an expungement of a citation from his prison disciplinary record. After a hearing, the trial court denied the inmate's motion, and the inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of aggravated sexual abuse of a child and dealing in material harmful to a minor. While in jail awaiting sentencing, he was accused of encouraging others to engage in prohibited sexual activities. After a disciplinary hearing in which the sheriff's office overran his right to remain silent and refused to allow confrontation of witnesses, the inmate was transferred to solitary confinement for nine months. He asserted a deprivation of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that the inmate's claims were moot. The inmate was no longer in jail but had been transferred to prison to serve his sentence. The court rejected the inmate's contention that the disciplinary action had collateral legal consequences because it would affect evaluations of his freedom while he was in prison and any parole decision. The supposed impact of the disciplinary record on a future parole hearing was purely hypothetical. The inmate failed to demonstrate that he was likely to be returned to the jail and likely be placed in administrative segregation again. Therefore, the issue was not one capable of repetition yet evading review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that &sect; 72-6-114 was unconstitutionally vague by asserting that the phrase local traffic only allowed for the unlawful discretionary interpretation by law enforcement officers. He also argued that relying upon the absence of a permit issued to local residents in order to stop defendant was insufficient to support a reasonable suspicion to support the stop. The court held that the local traffic only was not a phrase used in the statute, that the testimony that the barriers and notices complied with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways was not refuted, and that the district court correctly construed the local traffic only according to its common usage. Furthermore, defendant admitted that he did not live in the closed area and was not visiting a residence or business in the area but was traveling on the closed road to reach a destination over a mile away. Finally, the district court did not err in ruling that the officer had a reasonable suspicion that defendant was operating his vehicle on a closed road in violation of the law and that the stop was valid based on permits having been issued and barricades having been put in place.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court concluded that the trial court's consideration of defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty pleas was properly limited to a determination of whether defendant's pleas were entered knowingly and voluntarily. The appellate court concluded that the trial court acted within its discretion in determining that the pleas were knowing and voluntary and in denying defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty pleas because the plea hearing transcript showed that the elements of the charges to which defendant was pleading was explained to defendant, and defendant stated that he understood the charges. As to the psychosexual evaluations, defendant failed to raise this issue before the trial court and had not argued that the trial court committed plain error.

</DIV>

According to defendant, the ordinance was unconstitutional because it could be construed to preclude operation of a lumber or construction business that stored lumber. The appellate court concluded that the district court correctly ruled that defendant did not overcome the presumption that the nuisance ordinance was constitutional. The ordinance could not be fairly read in the manner defendant contended because the ordinance also required proof that the condition or use of the property be deleterious, noxious, injurious or unsightly. Although defendant claimed that the statutory scheme that established municipal justice courts was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers, he failed to adequately brief the separation of powers claim. The deficiencies in briefing and the presumption favoring constitutionality required the appellate court to affirm the district court's denial of defendant's separation of powers claim.

The mother and grandfather contended that the juvenile court failed to comply with the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), 25 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1901-1963.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DCFS obtained custody upon findings that the mother had mental health issues and that the grandfather, who was an Indian custodian under 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1903(6), physically abused the children. The court first held that DCFS was not required to make further active efforts, under 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1912(d), with the grandfather before removing the children. The court had jurisdiction to consider the appeal of the active effort issue because the issue was resolved in a combined adjudication and dispositional order, pursuant to Utah R. Juv. P. 46(a) and Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78A-6-311(2). The juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in determining that any further efforts with the grandfather would have been futile because the grandfather had received training for the seven years. Utah's independent abuse, neglect, and dependency procedures, under Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 78A-6-301 to 78A-6-324 (Supp. 2008), provided a framework for placement. However, the court remanded to the juvenile court to place the children immediately in accordance with the preferences contained in the ICWA, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1915(e), or to demonstrate good cause for deviating from those preferences.</SPAN></P>

Defendant provided some evidence suggesting that his counsel's assistance was deficient insofar as counsel failed to perform basic research and to investigate whether he actually associated with a known felon before advising him to admit to that alleged violation of his probation.

Further, Kanab City, Utah, Ordinance &sect; 13-200.04.020(1) (2006) was not unconstitutionally vague because it explicitly informed ordinary readers that it was a violation for dog owners to fail to obtain a kennel permit when they were keeping more than two dogs in any residential premise. Finally, there was no valid argument before the court that the inspection clause, Kanab City, Utah, Ordinance &sect; 13-200.04.050, encouraged arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third District Court, Salt Lake Department, Utah, entered an order awarding appellee wife an increase in child support, childcare expenses, and one-half of accrued health insurance premium payments in arrears. The trial court also rejected appellant husband's claim that the child support statute and its corresponding guidelines were unconstitutional. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband first argued that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the wife's claim for child care expenses; however, the husband did not marshal all of the evidence the trial court relied on in ruling on this issue. Absent any evidence to the contrary, the appellate court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The husband also argued that the wife was required, yet failed, to provide written verification that all child care expenses were incurred while the wife was either at work or at school. Nevertheless, neither the support decree or Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-45-7.16(2)(a) (2002) stated that the wife was required to provide this type of evidence. As to the constitutionality of the Uniform Child Support Guidelines and Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-45-7.7, the husband's arguments were not preserved, and he failed to provide any legal analysis supporting his assertions. Moreover, his arguments are based entirely on his additional support obligations, which he failed to document with testimony or record evidence at trial. Finally, due to the extensiveness of the deficiencies of the husband's appeal, the appellate court concluded that the appeal was frivolous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's order, and it remanded the matter to the trial court for a determination of reasonable attorney fees the wife incurred on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that, because the certificates documenting the calibration of the intoxilyzer machine used to determine defendant's alcohol concentration were prepared by the state trooper in the course of carrying out routine calibration testing as required by Utah Admin.

As such, they were admissible under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6a-515 (2005) and did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation even though the trooper who prepared the certificates was unavailable to testify at trial and defendant did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the trooper. The court rejected the State's contention that the certificates were self-authenticating documents under Utah R. Evid. 902. Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6a-515 set forth conditions that must be met in order to give rise to a presumption that the test results were valid; if those conditions were not met, foundational evidence would be required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a noise dispute concerning amplified outdoor concerts, plaintiff homeowners sued defendants--a city and its licensees--asserting claims including public and private nuisance, violations of ordinances, and takings of property. The Third District Court, Silver Summit Department (Utah), granted the city and licensees' motions for summary judgment and dismissal. The homeowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among the appellate court's holdings were the following: (1) for the most part, the licensees' actions did not constitute a public nuisance under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-803 (2003) because they were specifically authorized by the city, that is, they were in conformity with the regulations and requirements set forth by various licenses and ordinances; (2) because a few concerts exceeded the city's authorization and were in violation of noise ordinances, those concerts were unlawful for purposes of &sect; 76-10-803; (3) the permits and ordinances at issue did not prevent the homeowners from maintaining a private nuisance claim under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-38-1(1) based on interference with the comfortable enjoyment of their property because unlawful conduct was not a required element of a private nuisance claim; and (4) the trial court erred in dismissing the homeowners' takings claim on the ground that they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies because under the relevant ordinances, the homeowners were not required to appeal to the city's Takings Appeal Board, as they were not seeking to have their property developed or subdivided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court: (1) reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment on the claim for private nuisance; (2) reversed in part the grant of summary judgment on the claim for public nuisance; (3) reversed the trial court's dismissal of the takings claim; and (4) affirmed the trial court's rulings with respect to all of the other issues raised on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Second District Court, Layton Department (Utah), which convicted him of illegally taking protected wildlife, in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 23.30.3 (2007), for unlawfully possessing approximately thirty-eight rubber boa snakes that were imported into Utah without a valid certificate of veterinary inspection or entry permit, as required by Utah Admin. Code r. R657-53-21(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an amateur herpetologist specializing in the study of the species of snake commonly known as the rubber boa. The district court denied defendant's motion in limine challenging the constitutionality of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 23-20-3 (2007) and related regulations. On appeal, the court agreed with the district court's holding that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. When addressing a constitutional challenge to a statute, the court presumed that the statute was valid and resolved any reasonable doubts in favor of constitutionality. The court ascertained no vagueness in the statute or rule as they were applied to defendant's conduct. Utah Admin. Code r. R657-53-21(2) was very clear that both a certificate of veterinary inspection and an entry permit were required before a person might lawfully import any amphibian or reptile into Utah. Although Utah Admin. Code r. R58-1-4 was specifically referenced in Utah Admin. Code r. R657-53-21(2), the court would not limit the otherwise clear intent of Utah Admin. Code r.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was treated at a hospital after a car accident. The State subsequently subpoenaed the hospital to obtain defendant's medical records, including the results of any blood tests. After the trial court denying defendant's motion to suppress, he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of drugs in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6a-503(2) (Supp. 2007). On appeal, the court held that the State's failure to give defendant notice of the subpoenas issued to the hospital violated Utah R. Civ. P. 45(b)(1)(A) and defendant's rights and therefore constituted an unreasonable search and seizure. The court further held that the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply, and therefore the medical records should have been suppressed, because the determination of applicability rested solely on the possibility of the State's compliance with notice requirements rather than on a showing that the State would have discovered the evidence through some other legal means.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing before a court commissioner, the commissioner signed a protective order for petitioner wife against respondent husband. That same day, a  judge of the Second District Court, Ogden Department (Utah), signed the protective order. The trial court denied the husband's motion seeking to declare as unconstitutional the practice of allowing commissioners to conduct evidentiary hearings in protective order matters. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the authority of court commissioners under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3-31 to conduct evidentiary hearings, enter proposed findings, and make recommendations was not an unconstitutional delegation of core judicial functions. As provided by statute and court rules, parties could object to commissioners' findings and recommendations. Because the hearing before the commissioner in the case at hand was not a settlement conference, it was not subject to Utah Jud. Council R. Jud. Admin. 6-401(2)(J), requiring certification to a district court judge. The Cohabitant Abuse Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 30-6-4.2, 30-6-4.3 (2007), did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VII and Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 10 by not providing for a trial by jury. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's sanctioning of the husband's counsel for violating Utah R. Civ. P. 11(b) because: (1) counsel's legal argument concerning the right to a jury trial in Cohabitant Abuse Act cases had been rejected in a prior case, (2) counsel was on notice of case law that refuted his position, and (3) he did not refer to that case law or attempt to provide contrary authority when he again asserted this argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a divorce case, appellant father appealed a judgment of the Second District Court, Ogden Department, Utah, awarding sole physical and legal custody of the parties' minor child to appellee mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the trial court violated Utah R. Evid. 610 by allowing testimony and the admission of a letter regarding his religious experiences. The instant court concluded that the admitted evidence did not prejudice the father or violate rule 610. The trial court did not refer to the letter or the father's religious experiences in its findings. The father also argued that the evidence submitted to the trial court did not support the trial court's findings. Much of the father's argument was based on his belief that the trial court's award of full custody to the mother revolved around the trial court's improper reliance on false allegations of abuse. However, the evidence did not support the father's claim. The trial court based its decision to reject joint custody on the parties' inability to cooperate, which the evidence amply supported, not on the abuse allegations. Although the father also claimed that the trial court made &quot;contradictory&quot; and &quot;improper&quot; statements that were prejudicial to him, the comments to which he referred demonstrated that the trial court was attempting to help him with basic trial procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court erred in denying her motion to suppress evidence seized during a search of her vehicle. Defendant argued that failure to maintain owner's insurance on her vehicle did not justify the initial stop since under Utah law, an &quot;operator's policy&quot; was a viable alternative form of insurance for the driver of an otherwise uninsured vehicle, and the computer check did not identify whether the driver of defendant's car had an operator's policy. The appellate court found that Utah Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;31A-22-303 was directed to insurance companies, not vehicle owners, and in no way relieved defendant of any other statutory obligation she had to insure her car. Since defendant presumably had neither owner's nor operator's insurance, was in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-12a-301(2)(a), regardless of the driver's insurance status. The traffic stop was justified because the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe that defendant had committed an offense. He knew that defendant's vehicle did not have the requisite insurance when the computer check indicated a lack of insurance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father appealed from the entry of a civil stalking injunction growing out of a dispute about his daughter's high school English grade pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 77-3a-101, 76-5-106.5(2) (2003). The appellate court affirmed however, stating that while it was far from persuaded by the father's argument that his conduct did not reasonably cause the teacher emotional distress, the appellate court could nonetheless affirm the trial court simply because the father's conduct caused the teacher to reasonably fear bodily injury pursuant to &sect; 76-5-106.5(2)(a)(i), (c)(i). Additionally, from the first incident to the third incident, the father's conduct appeared to have been escalating in both hostility and aggressiveness. That was important because in cases involving civil stalking injunctions, appellate courts looked at the totality of the circumstances in evaluating whether or not certain behavior caused the requisite emotional distress or fear of bodily injury.</SPAN></P>

The buyers also appealed the denial of their motion to amend the complaint and an order directing them to release a lis pendens. The sellers cross-appealed a ruling that the lis pendens did not amount to a wrongful lien entitling them to treble damages. Both parties appealed the denial of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyers signed a real estate purchase contract to buy the sellers' ranch contingent on obtaining financing, which was later changed to an oral lease with an option to buy because the buyers could not get a favorable loan. Before either the sale or the lease took place, the sellers sold the ranch to a third party. The buyers recorded a lis pendens against the ranch and sued for specific performance or damages. The sellers counterclaimed for damages, arguing that the lis pendens was a wrongful lien. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly held that, by their actions, the parties had abandoned the original sales contract, making specific performance, damages, and attorney fees unavailable. The statute of frauds barred the buyers' claim for specific performance of the oral lease option under a promissory estoppel theory. The buyers' tardy third motion to amend the pleadings to conform to the evidence was properly denied under Utah R. Civ. P. 15(b). The buyers' due process rights were not violated by the order to release the lis pendens, which, judged on the complaint, was not a wrongful lien under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 38-9-1(6) entitling the sellers to treble damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation brought an action against defendants for intentional interference with a contract, intentional interference with prospective economic relations, and civil conspiracy. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly dismissed the corporation's claims for lack of personal jurisdiction. Because the corporation did not show that any of defendants' acts fell within the Utah long-arm statute, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-27-24 (2002), either by tortious conduct or transaction of business, it followed that the corporation's claims did not arise out of those acts or contacts with Utah. Further, federal due process also precluded jurisdiction. Defendants had not &quot;purposefully availed&quot; themselves of the benefits of conducting business in Utah. Defendants were not engaged in any significant business activities within Utah, nor did they create any continuous obligations in Utah. The balance between fairness to defendants and the State of Utah's interest in providing the corporation a forum weighed in favor of defendants. Thus, defendants did not have sufficient minimum contacts in Utah.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, appellant argued that he, rather than the university, was entitled to attorney fees and costs under rule 11 because the university's arguments regarding removal were not warranted by existing law. At the same time, he argued that the district court erred when it imposed fees upon him after finding no violation under rule 11. The district court discussed the underlying procedural details and determined that the university's decision to remove the case to federal court was not done with an improper motive or without a basis in law. That the federal court reached a different conclusion than the university or declined to assert its supplemental jurisdiction did not support a conclusion that the university violated rule 11. Appellant failed to show that the district court's findings were clearly erroneous, and review of the record supported the findings. In addition, the Court of Appeals of Utah determined that the district court's conclusion that the university did not violate rule 11 was correct as was the court's award of attorney fees. The university successfully opposed each motion for sanctions and was awarded its fees as the prevailing party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third District, Salt Lake Department (Utah), convicted defendant, upon his guilty pleas, of communications fraud, a second degree felony, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-1801(1)(d) (Supp. 2006), and forgery, a third degree felony, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-6-501(3) (2003). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty and did not move to withdraw or challenge his plea prior to sentencing. Once the trial court entered its sentencing order, defendant lost his right to withdraw his guilty plea. Therefore, defendant's failure to comply with Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-13-6(2) (Supp. 2006) precluded the appellate court's review of his appeal because the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to do so. As such, defendant's challenge to his guilty plea, having been made outside the time period specified by the statute, could only be pursued under the Utah Post-Conviction Remedies Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 78-35a-101 to -304 (2002 &amp; Supp. 2006), and Utah R. Civ. P. 65C. Defendant argued that despite his failure to comply with Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-13-6(2) (Supp. 2006), the appellate court could review his claim under ineffective assistance of counsel, exceptional circumstances, or plain error. But, the current case law prevented the appellate court from reviewing his claim under plain error and ineffective assistance because it was bound by the decisions of the Utah Supreme Court. Thus, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to hear defendant's attack on his guilty plea in his direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-5-120(7) (2002) conferred appellate jurisdiction over cases originating in justice court when the district court ruled on the constitutionality of a statute without the further requirement of raising the issue in justice court. However, defendant had not challenged the constitutionality of the business license ordinance in his motion to dismiss before the district court, but rather the selective enforcement of the ordinance. Moreover, the constitutional issues raised in either a selective enforcement or a selective prosecution defense did not attack the constitutionality of the ordinance as such. Therefore, defendant had failed to raise an as applied challenge to the ordinance so as to vest the appellate court with jurisdiction. Finally, the district court did not consider or rule on the constitutionality of the business license ordinance. Instead, the district court ruled only that defendant failed to meet the elements of selective prosecution. Because the district court did not rule on the constitutionality of the ordinance, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was placed on probation, which was subsequently revoked, and sentenced to an indeterminate term, not to exceed five years, in the Utah State Prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his sentence of zero to five years as cruel and unusual punishment violative of the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and Utah Const. art. 1, &sect; 9. Defendant argued that the trial court committed plain error when it sentenced him to prison because it exceeded the parameters of decency and human dignity to sentence a defendant with mental limitations to prison instead of the state hospital. The appellate court found that Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;77-16a-103 and -104 applied to defendants who had pleaded or been adjudged GAMI. They did not forbid the imprisonment of those who were GAMI. Imprisonment was appropriate for defendants who pleaded GAMI and were found to be currently mentally ill if certain criteria were met. When balancing defendant's right to treatment against society's right to protection against a potentially dangerous individual, defendant's incarceration in the state prison instead of the state hospital would not shock a person's moral conscience.</SPAN></P>

His affidavit noted that he conducted a traffic stop of a vehicle leaving defendant's apartment and the occupants stated that defendant was selling methamphetamine from his apartment. The short and frequent visits to defendant's apartment were consistent with drug trafficking. Each visitor would entered through defendant's basement door; several of the vehicles' registered owners had histories of possessing and selling narcotics and possessing drug paraphernalia. The affidavit contained sufficient facts to support the judge's determination of probable cause. The trial court did not err by failing to suppress the evidence obtained during the search of defendant's apartment. Inside the apartment, police found a small plastic bag containing a pesticide that was the typical method of packaging methamphetamine. The appearance of the substance inside the bag was consistent with methamphetamine. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions for the manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to distribute, of an imitation controlled substance, and for possession of drug paraphernalia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, the trial court held that the developers' intentional interference claim was jurisdictionally barred because, among other reasons, the notice of claim was defective. In their notice of claim, they listed three potential claims against the city: (1) breach of contract; (2) &sect; 1983 claims against certain city officials; and (3) other causes of action. The developers argued that that was sufficient to put the city on notice of an intentional interference with economic relations claim. They asserted that the document, when viewed as a whole, provided the city sufficient opportunity to investigate, discuss, and resolve the potential claim before the parties became locked in a lawsuit. That argument, however, was unpersuasive. The notice of claim failed to indicate that the developers intended to pursue an intentional interference with economic relations claim. Therefore, they were precluded from raising that claim on appeal, and the trial court was correct in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider it because the notice failed to meet the notice requirements of the former Governmental Immunity Act set forth in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-11 (1997 &amp; Supp. 2003).</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The record indicated that counsel was not inattentive to the juror. In regard to the mugging of the juror's spouse, counsel asked the trial court and the prosecutor if the juror should be specifically questioned about whether the mugging would affect his or her impartiality. In response, the trial court stated that the juror did not need to be rehabilitated, and that it would deny a challenge for cause. Because counsel made specific efforts to address any potential bias the juror might have had, counsel was not inattentive during jury selection. Moreover, the record revealed that counsel performed diligently throughout jury selection by taking notes during voir dire and creating a seating chart. Counsel used peremptory challenges on a former police officer, an individual whose sibling worked as a parole officer, and two burglary victims. As such, counsel's performance was not deficient under Strickland.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-25 (2002) was unconstitutional. In addition, plaintiff argued that the trial court erred when it held that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-35 (2002) did not toll the statute of limitations. The instant court noted that plaintiff cited no authority for his argument that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-25 was unconstitutional. He also offered no argument that the four-year time period allowed by the legislature for his cause of action equated to a denial of justice. Consequently, plaintiff's argument regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 78-12-25 was without merit. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-35 did not apply because defendant was at all times amenable to service of process pursuant to Utah's long-arm statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third District, Sandy Department (Utah), convicted defendant of aggravated assault, a second degree felony, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-103 (2003), and burglary, a second degree felony, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-6-202 (2003). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the plea hearing, the State informed the trial court that the parties had reached a plea agreement wherein the State would dismiss eight of the nine charges in the original information and add an additional charge of aggravated assault. The State then informed both the trial court and defendant of the elements of that charge, stating that the amended information would charge that defendant intended to cause serious bodily injury while committing an assault. Immediately thereafter, defendant pled guilty. The trial court's failure to include the intent element in the plea affidavit and colloquy was not fatal since the elements of aggravated assault were correctly given to defendant immediately before he pled guilty to that offense. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Additionally, because the record contained evidence that the crime of aggravated assault was committed and that defendant likely committed the crime, the factual basis for defendant's guilty plea for that crime was adequate. Thus, the trial court strictly complied with Utah R. Crim. P. 11(e)(4)(A), (B) in the entry of defendant's plea to aggravated assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children were removed for their mother's custody after she relapsed into methamphetamine use. The juvenile court concluded, based on the mother's history of inconsistency and the evidence presented, that the mother was unfit despite her progress between the permanency hearing and the termination hearing and terminated her parental rights. On appeal, the court held that the juvenile court erred by making findings at the permanency hearing with the intent to use them in support of its eventual termination order. The court further held that there were multiple factual findings in the termination order that were rendered clearly erroneous by the mother's post-permanency hearing efforts to rehabilitate herself, and that the remaining factual findings were insufficient to establish any of the cited grounds for termination by clear and convincing evidence at the time of the termination hearing. Because the mother's neglect of her children consisted of her drug use, the juvenile court gave insufficient weight to evidence of her post-permanency hearing rehabilitative efforts, which included the fact that she had maintained sobriety for over five months.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for forcible sexual abuse and the court reversed the conviction, stating that although the ordinary and accepted meaning of the term &quot;touching&quot; typically included contact that occurs over clothing, the Legislature, in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-407 (2003) specifically enumerated the offenses to which that broader definition of touching applied. That statute included a list of three offenses for which any touching, even if accomplished through clothing, was sufficient to constitute the relevant element of the offense, &sect; 76-5-407(3). Because forcible sexual abuse was not one of those enumerated offenses, the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury on the law that skin to skin touching was not required.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was tried as an adult and convicted of aggravated robbery. On appeal, the juvenile claimed that claiming to have a gun, standing alone, did not show that the crime was committed in a violent or aggressive manner and that his other actions were not ruthless or extreme enough to be characterized as violent or aggressive. The court found that even though the juvenile never made any physical manifestation that he had a gun or explicitly threatened to use it, the statement &quot;I have a gun,&quot; coupled with a demand for any money the victim was carrying, implied a threat that a gun was readily available and would in fact be used if the victim failed to cede to his demands. It would certainly have been reasonable for the victim to surmise that he had a gun and was prepared to use it. Given the juvenile's verbal threat in conjunction with his actions, i.e., putting himself in a close and uncomfortable proximity to the victim, preventing the victim from entering her truck, and helping himself to property in the victim's car, the circumstances of the robbery supported the conclusion that his role in the crime was violent or aggressive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in the Appeals Division of the Utah Tax Commission upheld a $ 135,000 fine levied by appellee tax commission's motor vehicle enforcement division against appellant car dealership for allowing unlicensed salespeople to sell cars in violation of the licensing statutes,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-3-201(2), 41-3-210(6), and 41-3-702(1)(c)(vii) (2005). The dealerships appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealership argued that the ALJ incorrectly interpreted the term &quot;offense&quot; in Utah Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;41-3-702(2)(a)(iii). The ALJ focused on the language that prohibited &quot;assisting an unlicensed dealer or salesperson in sales of motor vehicles,&quot; &sect; 41-3-702(1)(c)(vii) and concluded that because &quot;dealer&quot; and &quot;salesperson&quot; were singular and &quot;sales&quot; was plural, the dealership committed an &quot;offense&quot; under the penalty provision of the statute each time an unlicensed salesperson sold one or more cars. The Court of Appeals assumed that the legislature advisedly made &quot;dealer&quot; and &quot;salesperson&quot; singular and &quot;sales&quot; plural, thus, the ALJ properly considered the plain and literal meaning of those terms as written. The dealership argued that the fine assessed for the unlicensed dealers employed at its four dealerships was &quot;clearly excessive&quot; in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The court of appeals disagreed. The fine was not grossly disproportional when compared to the monetary value gained by participating in the prohibited activity, i.e., the selling of cars by unlicensed salespeople. And, harm was but one factor in the analysis and the other factors weighed in favor of upholding the fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court, without giving the mother any notification or opportunity to appear, signed a written ruling dismissing the custody petition. The district court explained that it did so because the petition was without any request that the court determine the standing of the parties to bring the action, such as a divorce or an action to establish paternity. The mother argued that her custody matter was justiciable separate and apart from actions of divorce or paternity and thus, she was not required to include such a request in her petition. On appeal, the court found that, although the issue raised by the appeal was not specifically preserved below, the mother could appeal and argue district court error under Utah R. Civ. P. 46 as the error first appeared in the court's ruling and she did not have the opportunity to object before the court issued its order of dismissal. Further, while the district court implied that the mother lacked standing to bring a petition for custody of her child, the court, under Utah Const. art. VIII, &sect; 5 and Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 11, could not refuse to hear the custody case simply because the case was devoid of a divorce or paternity context.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions, but the court affirmed, stating that his aggravated kidnapping conviction did not merge with the forcible sexual abuse conviction because the victim's confinement was not slight, inconsequential, or merely incidental to the forcible sexual abuse. Specifically, the forcible sexual abuse was completed in a matter of seconds, whereas the victim's confinement lasted for hours. Second, confining the victim for hours was not inherent in the forcible sexual abuse perpetrated in the case. Because the two convictions did not merge, his counsel did not provide ineffective assistance for failing to request such merger. Additionally, the evidence regarding defendant's prior bad acts was clearly introduced to impeach defendant. The State impeached defendant's testimony by bringing up instances in which defendant had indeed been charged with serious domestic violence. Evidence of defendant's prior bad acts was relevant to establishing his credibility, and credibility was a crucial issue in the case.</SPAN></P>

The victim claimed the trial court erred in interpreting and applying the civil and criminal stalking statutes,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 77-3a-101 and 76-5-106.5, and that the criminal statute's definition of emotional distress was inapplicable in the context of civil stalking injunctions. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in applying the definition of emotional distress used for purposes of &sect; 76-5-106.5 because the legislature had expressly instructed that both criminal and civil stalking be proved by the same elements, and Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-3a-101 merely incorporated by reference the definition of criminal stalking provided in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-106.5. However, the court held that the trial court improperly considered each incident separately, without weighing the effect of the entire course of conduct between the parties in determining if the student's conduct was &quot;directed at&quot; the victim. The court held that the victim's claim that the trial court erred in failing to issue a permanent injunction was premature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court judgment and remanded with instructions for the trial court to consider the entire course of conduct between the parties in determining whether the student violated the civil stalking statute. The court also reversed the denial of the student's request for attorney fees and instructed the trial court to consider it under the civil stalking statute's fee provision, rather than the general attorney fee statute.</SPAN></P>
