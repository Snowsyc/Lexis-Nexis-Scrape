One contract section called for all disputes between the contractor and the property owner arising out of the contract to be decided by arbitration. Several disputes arose. Eventually, the property owner terminated the contract, and directed the contractor to remove its personnel and equipment. While the parties tried to work out their differences, the contractor became concerned because it had only 180 days after the work had been completed to petition for a mechanics' lien. To protect itself, it filed such a petition. Later, it filed a petition to compel arbitration. The property owner opposed the petition to compel arbitration and claimed that the contractor had waived its right to arbitration by seeking a mechanics' lien. The trial court disagreed with the property owner and the intermediate appellate court affirmed. On further review, the state's highest court found that under the circumstances, the contractor did not waive its right to compel arbitration merely by seeking and obtaining an interlocutory mechanics' lien.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners filed an action against appellees, a mayor and a city council, for judicial review of a decision of a board of municipal and zoning appeals restricting the number of days per week the owners could operate a nonconforming use. The trial court affirmed the board's decision. The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed the trial court's judgment as to the restriction. The court granted the owners a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners operated a nightclub that had featured adult entertainment after hours twice a week since 1983. After a zoning inspector issued a code violation notice, the board held that the adult entertainment was a valid nonconforming use. It limited that use to two nights per week. The intermediate appellate court upheld the restriction based on Baltimore, Md., City Zoning Code &sect; 13-406, which prohibited the expansion of certain nonconforming uses. It held that a temporal modification of a nonconforming use was an expansion of that use rather than a mere intensification of it. The court disagreed. It stated that Maryland cases had held that an intensification of a nonconforming use was permissible so long as the nature and character of that use was unchanged and was substantially the same. The court had consistently held that merely increasing the frequency of a nonconforming use was not an unlawful extension but an intensification. Increasing the number of nights on which adult entertainment was presented at the club here from two to five, for example, would be an intensification. The out-of-state cases relied upon by appellees were either distinguishable or unpersuasive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the intermediate appellate court with instructions to it to reverse the trial court's judgment and to remand the case to the trial court for entry of a judgment in favor of the owners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the State's petition for writ of certiorari, challenging the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which reversed defendant's convictions on appeal. Defendant had been convicted of the murder of a woman and related offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from his alleged murder of the victim to collect life insurance money. Central to the State's case was the testimony of an informant, who had occupied a cell adjacent to the one occupied by defendant when defendant was being held on the murder charge. The informant testified that defendant admitted to committing the murder as well as admitted to purchasing the murder weapon. The informant testified that he was getting nothing out of his testimony and that it was being given out of the goodness of his heart. Although unknown to the prosecuting attorney in defendant's case, the informant was a long-time paid and registered policy informant who had cooperated with the State's Attorney's Office in a number of cases and had received lenient treatment in the past for his information. The lower court had concluded that the State's Attorney's Office was on notice of the informant's status and failed to discharge its Brady obligation to disclose information favorable to defendant, with such failure to disclose tainting defendant's conviction. The court agreed that the State's non-disclosure was material to defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with various sexual offenses and was found incompetent to stand trial. Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges. The Circuit Court for Caroline County (Maryland) affirmed the district court's denial of the motion. Petitioner's motion for certiorari was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented to the appellate court was whether the procedures set forth in Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc, &sect;&sect; 3-106, 107, relating to the commitment of a defendant to a facility designated by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) and to dismissal of the pending criminal charges, pass constitutional muster when DHMH has concluded that the defendant is not likely to achieve competence within a foreseeable time. Under what circumstances in that situation can the State Constitutionally continue to hold the defendant in confinement? At what point must the pending charges be dismissed? The appellate court held that it was unable to address the issue presented because petitioner chose the wrong vehicle for presenting the issue to the appellate court. The order denying relief from continued confinement was not a final order in the pending criminal case and therefore, was not appealable as a final judgment. The appellate court noted that petition could have effectively presented the issues of release from confinement and dismissal of the criminal charges though a petition for habeas corpus or a petition for release under Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. &sect; 7-507.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court was vacated and the case was remanded with instruction to dismiss the appeal from the district court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) entered a judgment that affirmed a trial court's ruling that granted defendant cable television provider's motion to vacate a permanent injunction, the effect of which was to allow the cable television provider to collect future late fees in accordance with a law that the Maryland General Assembly recently enacted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cable customers filed a class action lawsuit against the cable television provider that challenged a five-dollar per month late fee. The trial court entered an injunction that enjoined the cable television provider from collecting late fees. The highest court of review then ruled that the cable television provider could only charge the interest rate allowed under Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 57. In response to that decision, the Maryland General Assembly enacted Md. Code Ann., Com. Law &sect; 14-1315 (Repl. Vol. 2002), which was became effective on a particular date and increased the maximum allowable late fees that could be collected on specified consumer contracts. Eventually, the cable television provider requested that the trial court vacate the permanent injunction entered a few years earlier. The trial court, to comply with the new law, dissolved the injunction. The intermediate appellate court affirmed. On further review, the highest court of review found that it should not address a constitutional claim raised by the cable customers because that claim had not been raised in the trial court and the trial court had the authority to dissolve the injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) judgment convicting him, after a bench trial, of murder, assault, kidnapping, and related offenses, and sentenced him to death. He argued 17 issues on appeal, most prominently that he had not knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights to jury trial and jury sentencing and that various items of evidence should have been suppressed. He also challenged certain sentencing rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Abundant evidence, much of it supplied by defendant in statements made before he was in custody and in clothing that he consensually turned over to police, supported defendant's conviction of having kidnapped and brutally killed his girlfriend's daughter and seeking to extort money for her return. He argued, however, that he had not knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights to jury trial and sentencing. The court agreed with the State as to the waiver of jury trial, because the situation had been carefully explained to defendant and the court had just finished a detailed examination of defendant's mental state in finding him competent to be tried. When defendant waived jury sentencing nine weeks later, far fewer inquiries were made as to his understanding, despite the fact that he remained heavily medicated. It was not clear from the record that he understood his choices. Defendant's Fourth and Fifth Amendment challenges were either unpreserved or without merit. Finally, in dicta, the court directed that at resentencing the trial court should avoid illegal sentence increases and merge defendant's convictions of two types of kidnapping offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions in all respects but vacated the sentencing orders. It remanded the matter for a new sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Special Appeals Court (Maryland) entered a judgment that found, in contradiction to the findings of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), that respondent claimant made protected disclosures regarding alleged fiscal improprieties and that the ALJ erroneously precluded him from introducing evidence relevant to the merits of the underlying sexual harassment claim. Petitioner employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was hired to work as a manager at a marina run by petitioner state natural resources department. His responsibilities involved making the marina profitable, especially since it had posted a loss the previous year. Thereafter, sexual harassment allegations were leveled against him. The claim was investigated and the claimant was permanently transferred to another location as a result. He then filed a whistleblower action against the state natural resources department and alleged that the disciplinary action was not a consequence of the sexual harassment claim, but was retaliatory for alleged protected disclosures he made about purported fiscal irregularities in the marina's operating budget. An administrative law judge (ALJ) found that he had not proven that he had made the purported disclosures and barred him from presenting evidence about the merits of the harassment claim. The special appeals court disagreed with the ALJ. On further review, the court of last resort found that the claimant had not proven he made the allegedly protected disclosure and the sexual harassment claim evidence was irrelevant to the disciplinary motive.</SPAN></P>

The appeal involved the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which reversed the decisions of the relevant trial courts that dismissed the inmates' grievances, which alleged various regulatory amendments were ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The regulations at issue concerned special project diminution of confinement credits that were awarded to inmates for being double celled. The inmates asserted that the amendments were ex post facto laws, in violation of the United States Constitution and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 17. All of the inmates had been eligible for special project credits for double celling but were precluded from such credits as a result of the amendment set forth in Md. Code Regs. 12.02.06.05 (2002). Based on the amendments, the inmates were not eligible for the special project credits because their sentences included a disqualifying offense such as carjacking or murder. The court found that the amendments at issue were more than mere guides and were, in fact, substantive in nature and, therefore, were within the scope of the ex post facto clauses at issue as the adoption of the amendments immediately prohibited various categories of inmates from receiving special housing credits for double celling. In applying the ex post facto analysis to the regulation amendment, the court agreed with the lower court that it was an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his fifth appeal of a death sentence imposed after his conviction of first-degree murder for hire, defendant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Somerset County (Maryland) that denied his motions for a new trial, to correct sentence, and to reopen his post-conviction proceeding. He argued the relief was mandated by Brady violations and challenged the constitutionality of the death penalty statute and his death eligibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been convicted of hiring another to kill potential witnesses against him. He was eventually sentenced to death under the former death penalty statute,&nbsp;Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect;&sect; 412 and 413 (1982). The court held, first, that given the overwhelming evidence of guilt, defendant had not established that certain evidence that he claimed had not been made available to him would have made any difference in his outcome, so there was no Brady violation. Second, there was no Sixth Amendment violation in the procedure under which, after finding facts of death eligibility beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury then went on to exercise its judgment in weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances looking to a preponderance of the evidence. Finally, the plain language of the statute indicated that although for the most part only principals were death eligible, there was an exception for those who procured murders for hire.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped the car in which the driver was operating after seeing the car cross over a set of double yellow lines on the road. The driver failed the field sobriety tests administered and refused to take a chemical breath test. The driver was issued an order of suspension, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 16-205.1 (1977, 2002 Repl. Vol., 2005 Supp.), for refusing to take the chemical breath test. The ALJ suspended the driving privileges of the driver for one year. The trial court vacated the one year suspension upon determining that the ALJ failed to give proper consideration to the driver's employment as an insurance adjuster and that driving was required by his job, that the driver's prior alcohol offense was over eight years ago, nor that the ignition interlock was an available option on the driver's personal vehicle. The court held that the trial court erred in considering the issue of the admissibility of the preliminary breath test result before the agency since no objection to its admissibility was made. Further, the trial court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the ALJ in that substantial evidence existed to support the suspension.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fire department issued citations to plaintiffs, property owners, for fire code violations. The owners appealed the citations to a board of appeals, to the trial court, and to the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland). Those bodies found that the citations were properly issued. The owners petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which the state supreme court granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fire department cited the owners for fire hazards found in rented apartments. The owners argued that the language of Prince George's County, Md., Code &sect; 11-162 precluded issuing citations to or otherwise penalizing the owners of leased premises for the conduct of their renters involving the renters' personal property. The state supreme court held that the qualifying clause &quot;responsible for the condition or violation&quot; only modified the term &quot;other person.&quot; As a result, there were five separate persons or entities who can be cited: (1) the owner, (2) the operator, (3) the occupant, (4) the agent, or (5) other person responsible for the condition or violation. Thus, the statute allowed the fire department to cite the property owners. The owners also argued that Prince George's, Md., County Code &sect; 11-162 as applied violated their due process rights. The appellate court found that the statute, as applied, did not ask the property owners to inspect or even monitor every tenant's actions. It primarily requires that, upon notification of a violation, the landlord had to ensure that the violation was corrected. The appellate court found that this was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted plaintiffs, consumer and business customers, certiorari to review the decision of the Special Court of Appeals (Maryland), which dismissed plaintiffs' appeal that challenged a trial court decision approving a settlement of two consolidated class actions against defendants, a provider of telephone service and the Maryland Public Service Commission, over the objections of some plaintiffs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The settlement gave final approval to a settlement that reserved the amount of $ 12,500,000, which was subject to division between a cy pres group of customers that likely included most of the class members and the attorneys. The lower court dismissed the appeal as one not allowed by law in that it concluded that the settlement was not a final, appealable decision. Plaintiff asserted that though the order approving the settlement did not finally resolve how much the class members or anyone else will actually receive from the settlement, it nonetheless constituted a final judgment. Alternatively, plaintiffs noted that one aspect of the order was a directive barring class members from asserting claims encompassed by the settlement in any other court or tribunal, which was in the nature of an injunction, which did permit an appeal. The court agreed that the order was not an appealable final judgment but that the portion barring further suit was in the nature of an interlocutory injunction that was immediately appealable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court and remanded the case to that court with instructions to enter a judgment vacating the trial court's order barring class members from pursuing claims in other fora and that dismissed the appeal. The court also remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a writ of certiorari to decide the appellate issues raised by appellants, two payers, with regard to the judgment of the Baltimore City Circuit Court (Maryland) in favor of appellees, the State of Maryland, its prison system, a prison inmate fund, and other entities. Appellants asserted constitutional and statutory violations arising from the State receiving a commission from collect telephone calls made by inmates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The non-emergency telephone calls made by the inmates were assessed a specific rate, with the State receiving a commission on each call from the telephone company. Appellants, who received and paid for the calls, asserted that such commission remitted to the State was illegal under Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 14, Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 8, and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24, as well as violated the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (CPA), Md. Com. Law &sect; 13-301 (1975, 2005 Repl. Vol.). The court found that the trial court erred in dismissing appellants' claims for failing to comply with the Maryland Tort Claims Act (MTCA), Md. State Gov't &sect; 12-101 et seq. (2005), because a claim under Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 14 was not compensable in monetary damages and meeting the requirements of the MTCA was not necessary. The court held that the commission was within the scope of Article 14 because it was a charge imposed by the State that the Maryland Legislature consented to by enacting the Inmate Welfare Fund, Md. Code Ann., Corr. Serv. &sect; 10-502 (1999).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari to defendant's appeal from that portion of a judgment of the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland that affirmed his conviction of rape of a child and related offenses. He argued, most prominently, that a social worker's testimony regarding the child's statements was improperly admitted under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-304 (2001 &amp; 2005 Supp.) and that improper statements in closing argument required a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child testified at defendant's trial, but the State also presented a county-employed social worker as a corroborating witness, and she testified to the child's statements to her soon after the last incident of alleged abuse. The court held that since Maryland's whole child protection scheme relied on investigations by human services professionals, and since the social worker fell under that definition, she was certainly within the category of investigators who were allowed to testify regarding a child's statement of sexual abuse under &sect; 11-304. There was no confrontation issue because the child testified at trial and was available for cross-examination. The court nonetheless found it necessary to reverse defendant's convictions on other grounds. During closing argument, particularly, the prosecutor had used a &quot;golden rule&quot; argument and had made many inflammatory remarks and references to matters not in evidence, and the trial court had done almost nothing to stop her. Cumulatively, these improper remarks were likely to have prejudiced defendant's outcome and therefore constituted plain error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court and remanded the case to that court with directions to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the matter to that court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On its own initiative, the court granted certiorari, before review by an intermediate court, to plaintiff inmate's appeal of a Circuit Court for Allegany County (Maryland) decision upholding the validity of Directives 105-4 and 105-5 issued by defendant Secretary, Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS). The inmate argued that the directives were regulations within the meaning of Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-101.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Md. Code Ann., Corr. Serv. &sect;&sect; 2-109 and 3-205 authorized DPSCS and its Division of Correction to issue administrative directives to assure smooth running of corrections operations. Those statutes did not, however, exempt them from the rule-making procedural requirements set forth at Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect;&sect; 10-101 through 10-117. An inmate challenged the directives pursuant to which he had been deprived of credits, but an administrative tribunal and the trial court held that the rules were mere internal procedures, not subject to the statutory rule-making requirements. The court held that because of the due process implications of increasing a term of incarceration, such rules could never be mere internal procedures. They were rules within the meaning of Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-101, and were invalid because they had not been properly promulgated. To avoid chaos in prison administration, the court delayed issuance of its mandate for 120 days, to allow DPSCS to bring its rule-making procedures into conformity with the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded the matter to that court with instructions to reverse the administrative decision and to direct the inmate grievance office to conduct a hearing on the inmate's complaint. It further directed that its mandate not issue for 120 days, to permit DPSCS to adopt appropriate rules in accordance with administrative procedural statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted direct review to orders of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) denying defendant's Md. R. 4-345 motions to correct illegal sentence, his tenth and eleventh challenges to a death sentence imposed on him after being found guilty of a double murder for hire. He particularly argued that federal constitutional case law invalidated the burden of proof used by jurors in the Md. Code Ann., Crim. &sect; 2-303, weighing process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first noted that defendant's constitutional challenges probably should not have been raised as motions to correct an illegal sentence. Nonetheless, it reviewed the merits of his claims. First, the aggravating factors the State planned to argue did not have to be set forth in the original murder indictment, so long as defendant had ample notice of the charges and what he would need in the way of a defense. The Fifth Amendment's grand jury requirement did not apply to the states, and the Sixth Amendment and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 21 simply required fair notice. Defendant also argued that the decisions of the nation's highest court in Apprendi v. New Jersey and Ring v. Arizona invalidated earlier case law holding that so long as the aggravating factors justifying the death penalty were found, by a jury, to exist beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury could then apply a preponderance of the evidence standard in weighing the aggravating factors against the mitigating factors. The court dismissed the argument with no discussion, seeing no reason to modify its earlier rulings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari to plaintiff custodial father's appeal from an affirmance by the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland of a decision upholding third-party defendant agency's decision denying the father's request that it extinguish, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-1038(b) (2004), child support arrearages assigned to the State by nominal defendant mothers of his children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father had accumulated large child support arrearages, assigned to the State by the mothers when they were granted welfare benefits, by the time he assumed custody of his children. He sought forgiveness of the arrearages, arguing that it was in the children's best interest that he should use his income to support them, rather than paying the State. The court held that while the father claimed to request that the agency exercise its &sect; 5-1038(b) discretion to extinguish an order that related to facts that no longer existed, he was really, by the plain language of &sect; 5-1038 and Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 12-104 (2004), seeking a retroactive modification of his child support obligation, something the latter statute forbade. The father also challenged the agency's refusal to exercise its discretion under Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 10-112 (2004) to grant relief from arrearages in appropriate cases, arguing that it was an arbitrary and capricious decision based solely on the State's financial interest rather than the children's best interest. The court held that the legislature had determined, in establishing the enforcement process, that those considerations were entirely appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Principally relying on a statistical study commissioned by the governor examining the implementation of the death sentencing scheme, the inmate argued in his motion to correct an illegal sentence pursuant to Md.

He argued the death penalty statute was applied to him in violation of the Eighth Amendment and the Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 16 and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 25 prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment and in violation of his equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24. The motion was proper only if the alleged illegality occurred in the sentence itself or if, in a capital case, where the basis of the constitutional argument in support of the alleged error was based on a decision or decisions of the United States Supreme Court. There was no direct and specific evidence to suggest that the inmate's sentence was surrounded by impropriety of any kind. The case did not fit within the capital sentencing exception to Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari before an intermediate court considered an appeal by defendants, the Maryland Public Service Commission and its chairman, from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) that sustained plaintiff former state employee's appeal from her termination by the chairman and from a later termination by act of a majority of the commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The at-will management employee was terminated by the chairman without being given a reason, as were a number of others. The chairman later said he had been dissatisfied with her work at times but had not terminated her for misconduct. The court held, first, that reading Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect; 11-305 (2004) and various statutes dealing with utility regulation together, it was clear that the full commission, not the chairman, was the appointing authority so, in the absence of a delegation, the first termination was illegal. A majority of the commission effected the second termination, however, and that was upheld. The employee had not established that she was fired for misconduct, understood generally to mean serious violations of standards, and without such a showing, she was not entitled to the pre-termination procedures set forth at Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect; 11-106 (2004). Finally, although exhaustion of remedies rules were sometimes relaxed in cases involving constitutional challenges, the employee's challenges to the review procedures of Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect; 11-113 (2004) did not claim facial invalidity, so exhaustion was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the court agreed that the employee's initial termination was illegal, it held that her appeal of the second termination should have been dismissed. It therefore reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded with directions to enter judgment in favor of the commission and the chairman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a writ of certiorari before intermediate court review of petitioner Securities Commissioner's appeal from a Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) denial of her motion to enforce subpoenas for subscriber lists for respondent publisher's newsletter. The Commissioner claimed a compelling need to learn whether the Maryland Securities Act, Md. Code Ann. Corps. &amp; Ass'ns &sect; 11-101 et seq. (1999 &amp; 2004 Cum. Supp.) had been violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner issued the subpoenas because a customer complaint led her to believe that the publisher, not registered as a broker dealer or an investment adviser, was nonetheless operating in that capacity. She argued that interviews with subscribers would enable her to accurately determine whether the law had been violated. The court agreed with the trial court that the Commissioner appeared to be embarking on what amounted to a fishing expedition. She had not convincingly explained why the drastic measure of interfering with subscribers' rights to read and associate with others without being spied upon was the only way she could find out about the publisher's activities. The chilling effect of such disclosure on the subscribers' exercise of their federal and state rights of free speech and association was simply too great to permit enforcement of the subpoenas.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While review was pending, the court granted certiorari to an appeal by petitioners, an employer and its insurer, from a Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) grant of respondent injured employee's cross-motion for summary judgment upholding a determination of the Maryland Workers' Compensation Commission that the employee, an undocumented alien, was a covered employee within the meaning of Md. Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. &sect; 9-202 (1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee had not lied on his application, but had simply omitted a social security number. This meant that his employment was in violation of federal law, and subjected his employer to potential sanctions under 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1324a for failure to verify, among other things, but it did not mean that he was not a covered employee under Md. Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. &sect; 9-202 (1999). Like all remedial statutes,&nbsp;&sect; 9-202 was liberally construed so as to carry out its purpose, and both the plain language of &sect; 9-202 and its legislative history made it clear that coverage of both legal and illegal employees was intended. A federal case relied on by the employer was distinguished as having involved an alien who had forged his documents and then sought back pay for alleged wrongful discharge. This employee was simply seeking protections to which all injured workers were entitled. Nothing in the federal statute indicated an intent to preempt the area.</SPAN></P>

A scheduling order was issued that required the State to decide whether or not to proceed on the two charges within 30 days. The State never refiled the charges, and the circuit court found the failure to comply with its scheduling order fatal and, thereafter, dismissed the charges. Defendant asserted that it was within the circuit court's inherent power to have dismissed the charges. However, the court disagreed and held that the trial court erred when it dismissed the two charges. The court noted that a court's inherent power was to ensure the performance of a judicial function but that the power to sanction violations of scheduling orders by dismissing prosecutions was not necessary for the performance of the judicial function.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Maryland State Board of Education, challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which ordered the State to repay an $ 8 million loan to appellees, the Baltimore City Public School district and others (BCPS), declared that 2004 Md. Laws 288 &sect; 4 was unconstitutional, and made other rulings. The court granted the State certiorari to proceed with its appeal in the declaratory action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved an 11-year battle between the State and the BCPS with regard to the State providing public school funding. Prior caselaw precedent had established that the State was not constitutionally obligated to provide uniformity in funding among the various local school districts and that political subdivisions were not precluded from providing local funds to supplement basic State funding. The State had filed a motion seeking a declaration that State aid provided to the BCPS satisfied the constitutional standard of adequacy. The court found that the portion of the order requiring that the BCPS to receive repayment of the $ 8 million loan balance was immediately appealable under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-303(3)(v), but the State did not complain about that portion of the order. The only portion of the order that was properly before the court was the trial court directive that declared 2004 Md. Laws 288 &sect; 4 unconstitutional. The court held that ch. 288, which required the BCPS to eliminate its $ 58 million deficit, was constitutional and that the trial court order directing the BCPS not to comply was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated three paragraphs of the order of the trial court which ordered the BCPS not to comply with a particular statute. Otherwise, the court refused to express any opinion as to the rest of the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In petitioner Maryland Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division's proceeding under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, Md. Code Ann., Com. Law &sect;&sect; 13-101 through 13-501 (2000 &amp; 2004 Cum. Supp.), against defendant real estate professionals, the court granted certiorari before the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland could consider both sides' appeals of a trial court's partial affirmance and partial reversal of the Division's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The professionals--sellers, lenders, and appraisers--were found by the Division to have misrepresented both the value of homes sold and the qualifications of largely low-income buyers in order to obtain federally insured mortgages, on which many buyers defaulted. The court found substantial evidence in the administrative record supporting the Division's determination of the professionals' liability, noting that no showing of scienter was required under the Act. The one area in which the Division had erred was in applying principles of joint and several liability too broadly. Where restitution was ordered, joint and several obligations were proper only where they were based on findings of actions in concert but not where the wrongful misrepresentations were simply concurrent. Therefore, one appraiser who was not really part of the organized scheme should have been liable only for restitution as to transactions in which he was involved. Since the restitution was going to individual buyers, it was only to be granted to those who testified to actual reliance on the misrepresentations. There was no denial of jury trial rights or due process in a standard administrative proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and reversed in part the trial court's judgment and instructed that court, after remand, to remand to the Division after vacating its order, with instructions to enter a new order. The primary net changes from the original order were to limit joint and several liability for restitution awards and to limit individual restitution awards to those who testified to reliance on the misrepresentations.</SPAN></P>

The court on its own motion further considered whether the intermediate court had appellate jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widower sought a new trial on the issue of damages only after a jury's award failed to include non-economic losses or loss of household services. The court in banc granted a new trial, and the driver appealed to the intermediate court. Although it reversed the intermediate court's judgment as made without appellate jurisdiction, the court concurred in the result, finding that the trial judge had not abused his discretion in determining that if a new trial were granted to the widower it would have to encompass liability as well as damages. The ruling on jurisdiction was based on the plain language of Md. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22, which referred only to the court of appeals and had never been amended, when other constitutional provisions were, after establishment of the intermediate court. It also accorded with the general rule in Maryland that each appellant received just one appeal as of right, and that the widower had taken his appeal to the court in banc, with certiorari review available in the court's discretion in appropriate cases. If an appeal was mistakenly filed, the intermediate court could simply transfer it for certiorari consideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of the intermediate court and reversed the judgment of the court in banc. It remanded the matter to the court in banc with directions to affirm the trial court's judgment and order. It also directed its standing committee on rules to recommend rule changes to effectuate its holding in future cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff minor, by his mother, appealed a Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmance of a dismissal for failure to provide timely notice of claim of his medical malpractice action against defendant county that employed the physician who delivered him. He challenged the constitutionality of the Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-304 (2002 &amp; 2004 Cum. Supp.) time limit and argued that he had shown good cause for waiver of the requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Almost 10 years after the alleged negligence of a physician who delivered the minor at a county clinic caused him injuries, his mother, who had been an illegal alien, with little English, finally pursued legal action on his behalf. The &sect; 5-304 time limit for providing notice of claim had expired 180 days after the birth, and the statute did not contain a tolling provision for actions by minors. The court agreed with both lower courts that this provision did not violate equal protection because it bore a rational relationship to local government's need to learn quickly and act on potential claims against it. It did not deny him substantive due process because he had no vested property right in a tort action. His Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 19 right of access to the courts was also subject to reasonable restrictions, particularly in the case of rights created entirely by statute, which could be made subject to conditions precedent. Finally, there was no abuse of discretion in the finding that neither the minor's minority status per se, nor the totality of the circumstances including the adverse circumstances confronted by his mother, constituted good cause for such a long delay.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court found that clear and convincing evidence demonstrated that the attorney violated Md. R. Prof. Conduct 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.15(a), 8.1(b), 8.4; Md. R. 16-604, 16-607, 16-609; and Md. Code Ann., Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. &sect;&sect; 10-304, 10-306. The bar counsel recommended disbarment. The attorney filed exceptions. The court found that the attorney clearly did not act competently in pursuing a cause of action that had no legal basis and in failing to communicate with the client. Also, the attorney misappropriated client funds that were in escrow, failed to put other funds in escrow, and used client finds for personal purposes. Intentional misappropriation of client funds warranted disbarment where the circuit court did not find any factors in mitigation and the attorney did not offer any.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from the death of a fellow inmate. Defendant filed his motion to strike the State's notice, arguing that the State constitutionally was prohibited from seeking the death penalty against him because not all of the elements of the crime required for defendant to have been eligible for death were considered by the grand jury and contained in the indictment. Specifically, defendant contended that he was not eligible for the death penalty because the indictment failed to allege that he was a first degree principal. Upon reconsideration, the trial court granted the motion to strike as well as postponed the case to permit the State time to obtain a new indictment and to file a new notice. However, instead of obtaining a new indictment, the State filed its petition seeking prerogatory relief. The court held that it had no jurisdiction over the petition filed by the State, because the State was unable to appeal the trial judge's grant of the motion to strike.</SPAN></P>

Based on their execution of the form, the owners did not pay the Maryland excise tax, due at the time of purchase, on the sale of the vessel in Maryland. Because the Department observed the vessel in Maryland for months after the purchase, the Department issued a tax assessment to the owners, stating that the vessel had incurred the Maryland excise tax liability. The owners contended that the vessel was in Maryland for necessary maintenance and repair before they moved it to Florida. The Department argued that the vessel did not qualify for the Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. &sect; 8-716(c) exemption as it was not timely removed from Maryland. On appeal, the court found that, because substantial evidence supported the Secretary's findings and inferences, the Secretary did not err in deciding that the vessel was used principally in Maryland in the calendar year under Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. &sect; 8-701(n) (2000 Repl. Vol). Therefore, the owners were required to pay the Maryland excise tax.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court upheld the decision of the DNR, and the taxpayer sought review. In reversing, the court determined that a de novo review was appropriate on the agency's conclusions of law. The court used the well-established rules of statutory interpretation in making its decision. It found that the ordinary rules of English grammar supported the taxpayer's interpretation that intent was a requirement under &sect; 8-716(c)(1)(iv). The interpretation of the DNR would have required a rewriting of the statute. Further, the interpretation asserted by the taxpayer did not render &sect; 8-716(f) superfluous.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari to hear petitioner father's appeal from an affirmance, by the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland, of a trial court's judgment awarding sole legal and physical custody of the father's son to respondent maternal grandparents. The father argued that his employment at sea was not cause to deny him custody, particularly in light of the trial court's failure to find him an unfit parent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the parents divorced and the mother's substance problems resulted in incarceration, the father tried to care for his son, with whom he had a close bond, but he had to return to his career as a merchant marine captain. He accepted the grandparents' help in caring for the son, not knowing the mother had given them an ex parte authorization to exercise custody in her stead. When he returned, he resumed physical custody, but when he once again had to return to sea, he made other arrangements to have the son remain with the couple who had kept house for both of them while he was at home. The grandparents sought custody, and the trial court found that such an award was in the son's best interest. The court of appeals clarified that the true rule in Maryland was the one followed in the majority of states, that a best interests analysis was inappropriate in the fact of a fit parent's constitutional and common law right to raise his child. Although that presumption of a fit parent's right to custody could be overcome by exceptional circumstances, the fact that the father's occupation required absences, during which he had made appropriate arrangements, was not such a circumstance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the intermediate court. It remanded the matter to that court with instructions to reverse the trial court judgment and to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings, particularly regarding the father's petition for an award of attorney fees. Appellate costs were to be paid by the grandparents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was under revocation in two states because of past drunk driving offenses, and his revocation in Florida was permanent.

Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 16-103.1(1) (2002). There was no point in ordering the MVA to process the application, because &sect; 16-103.1 made the applicant ineligible as a matter of law.

The intermediate court had held that the admission, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-304 (2001), the tender years statute, of the girls' statements to a social worker violated defendant's confrontation guarantees, as interpreted in Crawford v. Washington.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As soon as the police investigation of the girls' allegations got under way, they were interviewed, in accordance with Maryland practice, by a state social worker at a child protective facility. The statements elicited by the social worker were introduced at trial after the trial court determined that the girls were unavailable to testify because of potential trauma. Defense counsel expressed state and federal constitutional objections at that time, and those objections preserved the issue for appeal. While appeal to the intermediate court was pending, the nation's highest court clarified the extent of confrontation rights in the Crawford decision, holding that an unavailable declarant's testimonial statements, that is, statements that a declarant objectively would know were likely to be used in a prosecution, could not be used at trial unless there had been a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. Although the girls were young, there was no reason to think that they were not well aware that the statements were being taken because of the police investigation their accusations had launched, so the statements were testimonial, not therapeutic, in their basic nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 7-304 (1997 &amp; 2001 Cum. Supp.), the version of Maryland's pick-up estate tax statute applicable to the estate, provided that taxes were due to the extent to which the federal credit for state death taxes exceeded Maryland inheritance taxes. In the normal situation, an estate took advantage of the unified credit against federal estate tax and the calculation was made. In the instant case, no estate tax was due because of another federal estate tax credit, the prior transfer credit, which was available because two successive transfers occurred when the decedents died within a few days of each other. The Comptroller argued that Maryland estate tax was due because the wrong sort of credit had been taken, even though the estate had not owed any estate tax once the prior transfer credit was applied. Because &sect; 7-304(c) was ambiguous, the court looked to the statute's legislative history and to prior case law. It was clear that the subsection was intended to prevent late filers of federal estate tax from claiming that no Maryland estate tax was due because no federal tax was paid. It was a different matter when some other credit meant that no federal tax was due.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted plaintiff driver's petition for a writ of certiorari challenging the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which affirmed a trial court judgment in favor of defendants, a county, a sheriff department, its sheriff, a deputy sheriff, and others. The driver brought suit asserting various civil rights violations under the United States and Maryland Constitutions, as well as negligence and malice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cause of action arose from a stop of the driver's luxury car as a result of it not displaying a license plate in the front. The deputy sheriff asked if he could search the driver's car for drugs, which the driver refused. The deputy sheriff then detained the driver while he obtained a canine unit to search the car. No drugs were found. The driver brought suit asserting that the stop violated his constitutional rights and was part of the sheriff department's practice of targeting African-American males driving expensive cars. The trial court had granted summary judgment in favor of defendants upon determining that the deputy sheriff had qualified immunity under the Maryland Tort Claims Act, Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 12-105 (1985). The court found error and held that public official immunity was inapplicable in actions against public officials for violations of a plaintiff's rights guaranteed by the Maryland Constitution. The court did clarify that the deputy sheriff, as an individual, was immune for damages and was substituted by the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court and remanded the case to that court with directions to reverse the judgment of the trial court in favor of the county and to remand that case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Proceedings and appeals were conducted in district and circuit courts. After granting a writ of certiorari on its own initiative, the court of appeals found that the county previously had no right to appeal a judgment entered in a district court appeal to the court of special appeals. What the county should have done was to file a petition for certiorari with the court of appeals. Therefore, the court of special appeals should have denied the motion and immediately transferred the case to the court of appeals. Further, if the county desired to challenge a circuit court's order, it was required to note an appeal. When it failed to do so within the 30 days allowed, the order became final; and, the appeal was dismissed. Thus, no appeal was properly before the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant voters sought review of the order from the Circuit Court for St. Mary's County (Maryland), which denied their petition for declaratory and injunctive relief seeking to enjoin certification of the results of the primary election for judicial offices and an order directing appellee county boards of elections to conduct new primary elections for judicial offices in which all registered voters in the counties could participate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters alleged that their rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the Maryland Declaration of Rights were violated because state election law permitted the exclusion of unaffiliated voters like themselves from participating in judicial primary elections. The circuit court denied their petition for relief. On appeal, the court affirmed, first finding that the voters' complaint should have been dismissed because it did not satisfy the Md. Code Ann., Elec. &sect; 12-202(a)(2), which required a party challenging an election to prove by clear and convincing evidence that there was a substantial probability that the outcome of the election would have been changed had it not been for the contested procedure. The court then found that the State had a legitimate interest in a policy of keeping partisanship out of judicial elections as far as possible without abandoning the long-established infrastructure of political party primaries. Its attempts to achieve that goal did not violate the equal protection provisions of either the Maryland or federal constitutions simply because some voters who declined to join a political party nevertheless wished to vote in that party's primary.</SPAN></P>

The injured person had brought a civil suit requesting $ 25,000 in damages as a result of a vehicular collision between the parties. The trial court denied the injured person's motion to strike the driver's jury demand after the injured person reduced his ad damnum clause from $ 25,000 to $ 10,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the injured person filed his complaint in a Maryland District Court, the driver elected a jury trial pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 4-402(e)(1) (1999), and the case was transferred to the trial court. The parties engaged in discovery for 18 months, and the injured person subsequently filed an amended complaint reducing his demand for damages to $ 10,000. The injured person then filed his motion to strike the jury demand made by the driver, which was denied. The injured person asserted that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it held that the driver was still entitled to a jury trial despite the fact that the amount in controversy no longer exceeded $ 10,000 because access to a jury trial was triggered solely by the amount in controversy, and his reduction of the amount in controversy divested the driver of her entitlement to a jury trial. The court disagreed and, upon finding that the Maryland General Assembly had never abrogated the common law entitlement to a jury, held that &sect; 4-402(e)(1) did not abrogate the common law entitlement to a jury trial when the amount in controversy failed to exceed $ 10,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence defendants sought to suppress was obtained when officers executed a warrant implicitly authorizing a &quot;no-knock&quot; entry. The issue before the court was whether, where there was no statute so providing, a judge was authorized to issue a &quot;no-knock&quot; warrant, on the basis of which the police could made a &quot;no-knock&quot; entry to execute the search and seizure warrant. The supreme court rejected the rule implicitly, if not expressly, enunciated by the appellate court in various opinions, requiring applicants for search warrants to obtain pre-entry authorization for a &quot;no-knock&quot; entry in addition to the authorization for the search. The supreme court held that a judicial officer in Maryland could not issue a &quot;no-knock&quot; warrant. Rather, the propriety of a &quot;no-knock&quot; entry would be reviewed and determined on the basis of the facts known to the officers at the time of entry, rather than at the time of the application for the warrant. The supreme court further found that the entry in the instant case was not justified by existing and articulated exigency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said Ring v. Arizona rendered Maryland's death penalty statute unconstitutional because it used a preponderance of the evidence standard to weigh aggravating factors against mitigating factors, when imposing the death penalty. The court of appeals held this was not a proper issue in defendant's case because the trial court did not find any mitigating factors existed, when it sentenced him, after he waived sentencing by a jury. A weighing of factors played no role in his sentencing. Even if such a weighing had occurred, Maryland's preponderance of the evidence standard in weighing aggravating circumstances against mitigating circumstances was not unconstitutional and did not invalidate Maryland's capital punishment law. It had been held in defendant's prior appeal that he made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to jury sentencing. He was properly advised, at that time, of the burden of proof to establish mitigating factors. Under Md. R. 4-343, once the sentencing authority found that one or more aggravating circumstances were proved beyond a reasonable doubt and no mitigating circumstances existed, the sentence was required to be death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cause of action arose from the attorney receiving unwanted facsimile advertisements. The advertisers engaged in the business of sending mass advertisements by facsimile. The trial court had granted the advertisers' renewed motion for summary judgment after an appellate court case opinion, which held that the trial courts of Maryland were not to entertain any federal private cause of action created by the Act. The only new issue in the case at bar was the advertisers' argument that the U.S. Congress's creation of a private cause of action, with exclusive jurisdiction in state courts and without a state right to opt out of such jurisdiction, exceeded Congress's authority under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court disagreed and reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the Act, to the extent that it conferred upon appropriate state courts exclusive required jurisdiction to entertain a federal cause of action, did not violate U.S. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari review to the State's interlocutory appeal from a Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) grant of defendant's motion to suppress DNA evidence being used to prosecute him for rape, on grounds that the Maryland DNA Collection Act, Md. Code Ann., Pub. Safety &sect; 2-501 et seq. (2003), violated U.S. Const. amend. IV. Defendant appealed the trial court's determination that the Act was not an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was incarcerated for another offense when, like all inmates, he was subject to taking of a DNA by a swab of his mouth for data collection purposes. The sample eventually was used to link him to an unsolved rape, at which point he challenged the constitutionality of the Act. The high court held that the intrusion was not an unreasonable one for Fourth Amendment purposes. It was far less intrusive than a blood test and amply justified by the interest in solving crime. Furthermore, as an inmate, defendant's expectation of privacy was greatly diminished. The trial court correctly found, however, that the Act was not an ex post facto law under either the U.S. or Maryland constitutions, because, like sex offender registration schemes, it was regulatory rather than punitive. If it was not a criminal law, it could not be ex post facto.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with the trial court's holding as to the ex post facto clause, but disagreed with it regarding search and seizure law. Therefore, it reversed the order of suppression and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari review to an appeal by plaintiff purported father from an order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) that dismissed his complaint seeking orders of visitation and to determine paternity of a child born to defendant mother while she was married to and living with another man. He argued that the trial court was required to order genetic testing by Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-1029 (1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother dated the purported father before she married her husband, but admitted to having had only one sexual encounter with the purported father thereafter. She admitted having led him to believe he was the child's father, but called it a sick game, engaged in because of feelings of guilt about an abortion. The high court agreed that genetic testing was not mandated under the circumstances and that the trial court had not abused its discretion in weighing the best interests of the child and determining that preservation of a stable family unit was paramount in the case of the child in question. Because of the presumption of legitimacy of Md. Code Ann., Est. &amp; Trusts &sect; 1-206 (2001), the purported father lacked the status of a putative father within the meaning of Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-1002(c) (1999), which was a prerequisite to being able to demand blood or genetic testing under Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-1029 (1999). That law designed to enable men to avoid being falsely identified as fathers of children born out of wedlock. Finally, the purported father failed to identify any cognizable constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs association and citizens sued defendants developer and county commissioners in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne's County (Maryland) to declare the commissioners' development rights and responsibilities agreement with the developer invalid. The trial court dismissed the case, and plaintiffs appealed. Before the special appeals court could consider the matter, the court of appeals sua sponte issued a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs objected to a development rights and responsibilities agreement (DRRA) between the county commissioners and the developer. The court of appeals held their proper recourse was an administrative appeal to the county's board of appeals, under Md. Ann. Code art. 66B, &sect; 4.07 (2003), which was to hear and decide appeals alleging an administrative officer's error in enforcing art. 66B, and, if aggrieved by the Board's final action, a petition for judicial review. The county commissioners acted legislatively when authorizing DRRAs in Queen Anne's County, Md., and reserving to themselves the role of &quot;public principal&quot; authorized to enter into such agreements. When they signed off on a DRRA with the developer, this was done in their administrative role as the &quot;public principal.&quot; Their approval was the act of an &quot;administrative officer&quot; or &quot;administrative official&quot; under the Maryland and County Codes, respectively, because the term &quot;administrative official&quot; embraced whatever administrative mechanism a local Maryland jurisdiction set up to enforce its planning and zoning laws and ordinances, including a multi-member body.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firefighters were required to attend various training sessions as part of their membership in the National Guard, which membership was a condition of their employment. The only compensation received for the National Guard service was pursuant to 37 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 204(a)(2) and 206(a). The firefighters filed suit in the circuit court, seeking overtime wages from the State pursuant to a variety of federal and state statutes. The circuit court granted the State's motion to dismiss the action, finding that the firefighters had an exclusive administrative grievance procedure under Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect;&sect; 12-101 through 12-405 (1997, 2003 Cum. Supp.). On appeal, the intermediate appellate court vacated that determination and remanded to the circuit court. On further appeal, the court found that the firefighters had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before seeking review of a final administrative decision in circuit court, such that there was a lack of jurisdiction. The court did not reach the issue as to coverage under the federal law. The court noted that its earlier decision in Bunch was controlling, and that the Kram precedent did not change the outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder for killing two people, and was under two death sentences. Defendant filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) a motion for a new trial based on allegedly newly discovered evidence, pursuant to Md. R. 4-331(c), and a separate motion to correct an illegal sentence, pursuant to Md. R. 4-345(a). The circuit court denied the motions. Defendant timely filed notices of appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to killing two people in a contract killing. He argued that he was entitled to a new sentencing hearing as newly discovered evidence in FBI reports taken at the time showed that he was not the shooter and therefore not eligible for the death penalty. He also argued that the trial judge's application, at his sentencing hearing, of an amendment to the Maryland death penalty statute regarding mitigating circumstances which became effective a few months after the murders violated the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States and Maryland Constitutions. Defendant's attorneys argued that newly discovered descriptions in the FBI reports of a man in the lobby where the victims were murdered contradicted the identification of defendant by two witnesses and showed that an African-American male in the lobby was someone other than defendant. On appeal, the court found that a new trial was properly denied, as the report statements did not contradict the two witnesses' testimony, and the evidence was overwhelming that defendant was the triggerman. Further, the application of the amendment to the sentencing hearing did not violate the ex post facto prohibition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After many, many instances of abuse by defendant, her ex-husband, including threats to kill her and the children, an ex-wife obtained a no-contact protective order. Before it went into effect, defendant took the children on vacation and over several days made repeated phone calls threatening violence. He argued on appeal that because he had made many calls one after the other, they constituted a single or a few transactions, not 18 separate offenses. The high court applied traditional principles of statutory construction to determine the appropriate unit of prosecution for violation of a protective order, and found a clear legislative intent, based on both plain language and legislative history, that each unlawful phone call was a separate violation of the order. Any other interpretation would have removed any incentive to desist after having begun to violate an order. Since 18 separate violations had been established, there was no impropriety in the trial court's decision, in hopes of protecting defendant's family, to impose 18 consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held the counselor had to file his wrongful termination suit no later than three years after the final administrative decision terminating his employment was made. This was when his employment was finally terminated. This final administrative decision was left to the discretion of the state board of education, which had primary jurisdiction. This decision exhausted his administrative remedies, as there was nothing left for the state board to do, and it was from at least this point that the statute of limitations applicable to his wrongful termination suit began to run. The subsequent judicial review of the final administrative decision under Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-222 in the trial and appellate courts was not considered part of the counselor's administrative remedies. As the counselor's wrongful termination action was not filed within three years of the decision of the state board of education, the suit was barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner and the marina owners were in a dispute regarding whether the marina was allowed to moor boats in the landowner's extended property line area, which the landowner planned to use as licensed offshore blind sites for hunting waterfowl. The landowner ultimately filed a suit for a declaration that the county ordinance was invalid since it purported to allow mooring in the landowner's riparian areas until a designated date that extended two months into the wild waterfowl hunting season. The lower court declared the ordinance unconstitutional and a petition for certiorari review was filed. The court granted review and found that the ordinance was preempted by state law. The ordinance exceeded the authority delegated to the county commissioners because they passed a regulation that conflicted with state law. The ordinance conflicted with Md. Code Ann., Nat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife was seriously injured in a one-vehicle accident that occurred while she was a passenger in a vehicle driven by her husband. The policy provided bodily injury liability coverage of $ 100,000 per person, unless the injured party was the insured or a member of the insured's family, in which case the statutory minimum coverage, $ 20,000, applied. Plaintiffs argued that this provision was void as against public policy. The supreme court disagreed. The Legislature prohibited liability coverage of less than the minimum amounts required by Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 17-103(b)(1). A &quot;household exclusion&quot; violated public policy only to the extent that it operated to prevent this mandatory minimum coverage. If the Legislature intended to require complete insurance coverage for injury spouses, it would have said so or increased the mandatory minimum liability limits. The supreme court, under the doctrine of separation of powers, could not invade the province of the Legislature and rewrite the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant had been terminated from a job for &quot;reasons of disability&quot; but never sought disability benefits and did not consider herself disabled. Because the claimant was not receiving any of the disability benefits required by the definition of disabled found in Md. Regs. Code tit. 07, &sect; 03.17.02B(6), the ALJ concluded that the claimant was not entitled to the uncapped shelter cost deduction provided for in the Food Stamp Act, 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2014(e)(6)(A). The claimant argued on appeal that the decision denying her the uncapped shelter deduction was arbitrary and capricious, that she should have been deemed constructively disabled with $ 0 income, and that denial of the uncapped deduction violated her equal protection rights. The court disagreed and held that a food stamp recipient must receive disability benefits in order to become entitled to the uncapped excess shelter cost deduction. The court concluded that &quot;receives&quot; meant &quot;actual receipt&quot; and that, as a result, the ALJ did not abuse her discretion when she found that the claimant was not disabled.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the decision of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which affirmed a trial court's rulings, denying defendant's motion to suppress inculpatory statements made during a bail hearing where he was not represented by counsel and, ultimately, convicting him of distribution of cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During trial, defendant moved to suppress statements he made during a bail review hearing where he was unrepresented by counsel, and his motion was denied. Affirming, the court held that, in the context of defendant's bail review hearing, the requirements of Miranda did not apply because, although he was in custody at the time, he was not &quot;interrogated&quot; where the district judge's question, &quot;Is there anything you'd like to tell me about yourself, sir,&quot; was merely giving defendant a chance to explain any circumstances bearing on his bail and was not designed to elicit an incriminating statement. Moreover, because defendant's bail review hearing was not a &quot;critical stage&quot; of the pretrial proceedings, i.e., it was not an adversary judicial criminal proceeding, his Sixth Amendment right to provided counsel had not yet attached. And, finally, the court held that the redacted version of the inculpatory statement, as it was read to the jury, was not so vague and misleading as to have made its admittance a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court. It was unquestionably relevant and its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Educ. &sect;12-104(b)(3) (2001), which authorized the Board to &quot;sue and be sued,&quot; did not waive sovereign immunity because the Legislature did not authorize a method of appropriating the funds for an adverse judgment nor did the Board have the necessary taxing authority; (2) the trial court correctly found that, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect;12-201(a) (1999), the Board did not waive sovereign immunity because the alleged contract with the students, namely, the tuition bill, was not signed by a duly authorized person; but (3) the trial court improperly found that sovereign immunity was waived for all actions in which declaratory and/or injunctive relief was sought, and, unlike the declaratory actions where the court found immunity was waived, the students were not challenging the legality of a statute or an official's implementation of a statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner physician appealed from a judgment of the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland that affirmed a trial court's judgment upholding the revocation, by respondent Maryland Board of Physician Quality Assurance, of his license to practice, on grounds that his sexual involvement with a series of patients violated Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. &sect; 14-404 (2003 Supp.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician commenced love affairs with a series of women while they were his patients, and continued treating them during their involvements, all of which ended badly for the women. He argued that the sexual involvements were separate from his treatment of them as patients, so that he could not be said to have violated &sect; 14-404. The high court disagreed, as had all tribunals that had reviewed the matter. First, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the physician, as it would have been clear to any doctor that a sexual involvement with a patient was forbidden. A physician's duty was to put his patients ahead of his own needs, and the physician in question had repeatedly let his own needs dictate his conduct toward his patients, including, in at least one case, the husband of one of the women. Therefore, Maryland joined a number of other states in holding as a matter of law that a sexual relationship with a patient was an ethical violation warranting license revocation.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 33, &sect; 13-209 (2002), recodified as Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law &sect; 13-245 (2003), by paying third persons for performing walk around services on election day, holding that the statute violated free speech guarantees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Md. Ann. Code art. 33, &sect; 13-209 (2002), originally enacted to prevent election corruption, prohibited candidates or others from paying persons for performing what were known as walk around services (such as distributing sample ballots) on election days. Defendants were arrested after engaging homeless people and others to perform such services in a statewide election. They argued that the statute impermissibly limited their federal and state free speech guarantees. The high court noted that constitutional case law was generally highly protective of political speech, subjecting any limitations thereon to strict scrutiny except in cases involving campaign contributions. Section 13-209 was not contribution-related; on the contrary, it limited candidates' abilities to get their message out to voters through one-on-one conversations. Furthermore, many other Maryland statutes attacked the problem of election corruption in more direct and effective ways. Therefore, the statute's limitations on free speech were impermissible.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-222(h)(3)(vi), subject to judicial review under the arbitrary and capricious standard. The Court of Special Appeals exceeded its authority by compelling the board to exercise this discretion. Whether the board erred in not recusing members participating in settlement negotiations was separate from its failure to refer the case to the OAH. Even if the board had to recuse panel members, it was not bound to refer the case to the OAH. Its refusal to refer the case to the OAH was not arbitrary or capricious. Even conceding the error of its failure to recuse certain panel members, that did not make its decision not to refer to the OAH arbitrary or capricious. Double jeopardy did not preclude the board's rehearing, nor did res judicata apply, as there was no final judgment or subsequent cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the appellate court was reversed as to its requirement that the board, on remand, refer the matter to the Office of Administrative Hearings; otherwise, the judgment was affirmed. If the board chose to rehear the matter, board members who participated in settlement negotiations with the pharmacist could not participate in the hearing panel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Allegany County (Maryland), which convicted him for premeditated murder, first degree sexual offense, robbery, and false imprisonment, and which imposed a sentence of death for the murder, 30 years in prison for the first degree sexual offense conviction, five years consecutive for the robbery conviction, and one year concurrent for the false imprisonment conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with several offenses related to the death of a babysitter, and the death penalty was sought. Defendant was acquitted of an attempted rape charge, but convicted of all other charges. A jury unanimously concluded, by a preponderance, that the aggravating factor of first degree sexual offense outweighed the mitigators and that defendant should be sentenced to death for murder. Additional prison terms were ordered on the other crimes. On appeal, defendant did not contest that he strangled the babysitter or engaged in sexual activity with her. He argued the sex was consensual, so there was no aggravator for the death penalty. He also challenged his interrogation, use of his confessions, and the jury instructions. The court found that even though defendant's initial interrogation was possibly tainted, his later waiver of Miranda was valid, so the confessions were properly admitted. The jury instructions were all proper as well. Finally, the court found there were three admissions, plus forensic evidence, establishing that sexual activity of some kind occurred and there was medical evidence indicating the activity may have been violent and non-consensual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed all of the guilty verdicts, and the prison sentences imposed for the first degree sexual offense, robbery, and false imprisonment convictions. However, the court reversed the death sentence and remanded for a new sentencing proceeding on the murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed a trial judge's decision convicting him of three separate counts of the unlawful possession of a firearm under former Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 445(d)(i), (ii), and (iii) (2001) for possessing a single regulated firearm on a single occasion and sentencing him to three separate sentences pursuant to former Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 449(e) and (f) (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's three separate possession convictions were based on his status as a person previously convicted of a crime of violence, a person previously convicted of a felony, and a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor with a penalty of over two years of incarceration. Reversing in part, the court held that the legislature did not intend for a court to render separate multiple verdicts of convictions for illegal possession of a regulated firearm where defendant fit within several categories of prior qualifying convictions, but only possessed a single regulated firearm on a single occasion. Relying on state and federal caselaw, the construction of the recodified provisions of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect;&sect; 445, 449 (Md. Code Ann., Pub. Safety &sect;&sect; 5-101(g) and 5-133 (2003)), and the rule of lenity, the court concluded that the phrase &quot;Each violation shall be considered a separate offense&quot; in Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 449(e) referred to each current act of illegal possession, rather than to each prior qualifying felony conviction. Thus, only one of defendant's convictions under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 445(d)(1), specifically his conviction under &sect; 445(d)(1)(i), could stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for possession based on his status as a person previously convicted of a crime of violence, but it reversed defendant's convictions based on his status as a person previously convicted of a felony and based on his status as a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor with a penalty of over two years of incarceration, and it remanded to the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

The court referred the matter to a circuit court for an evidentiary hearing. The hearing judge concluded that neither the rules of professional conduct, nor any other provisions of the Maryland code, were violated. The Commission filed objections. The court found the heart of the complaint was that the attorney violated Md. R. Prof. Conduct 1.15, 8.4, and Md. Code Ann. Ins. &sect; 22-103 (2003), which governed trust brokers' deposits of trust money, by depositing the interest from funds entrusted to him by his trust brokerage clients into his title insurance company's account without the express consent of the beneficial owners. The attorney responded that he could gain consent from either the client or the beneficial owner. It was undisputed that he had the client's consent. The court found the attorney was acting as a broker, not an attorney, and the Insurance Commissioner did not discipline his actions. Also, clear and convincing evidence did not exist that the attorney committed a criminal act in violation of the rules of professional conduct. Therefore, the petition was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 49B, &sect; 42 (2003), violated Md. Const. art. XI-A in an action by plaintiff employee seeking to recover for employment discrimination that violated Prince George's County, Md., Code &sect; 2-222 (1999).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three of the counties that enjoyed home rule rights under Md. Const. art. XI-A to enact legislation so long as they enacted only local laws were further explicitly empowered by Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, &sect; 42 to enact anti-discrimination legislation. The county where the employee worked out of an office for her employer enacted such ordinances, and she claimed that the employer, through her manager, discriminated against her in many ways that were forbidden by ordinance. The high court held that all the constitutional provision did was forbid the enactment of statewide public laws, but the ordinance could be construed as applying only to discriminatory acts in the county of enactment by an employer with a significant presence there. The fact that new causes of action were customarily created in other ways did not preclude the county from authorizing a lawsuit. Thus, the law was a local one, authorized by a statute that did not have to be construed as allowing counties to enact laws of statewide application. Moreover, &sect; 42 was not a forbidden local law because it applied to more than one county.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 11-504 (1998), a debtor in bankruptcy could claim, as exempt from his bankruptcy estate, wages previously garnished by a judgment creditor, pursuant to Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bank sued a debtor in a Maryland court, and obtained a judgment awarding it money damages. After it obtained that judgment, the bank filed a writ of garnishment to enforce its judgment, and it attached 25 percent of the debtor's wages. In December 1998, the debtor filed a petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 701 et. seq., and sought recovery of $ 1,064 which was withheld from his wages and paid to the bank under the writ of garnishment during the 90-day period before he filed his petition for bankruptcy. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit asked the state supreme court to determine whether, under Maryland's exemption scheme, the debtor was entitled to recover the amount withheld from his wages. The state supreme court interpreted Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 11-504 (1998), and held that, when the debtor filed for bankruptcy, the wage attachment became a preferential transfer in the form of earned wages, which was recoverable by the trustee in bankruptcy and, derivatively, by the debtor.</SPAN></P>

The Commission denied the petition, however, and the trial court affirmed the Commission's decision. The state supreme court held that (1) residents who lived in the area that was annexed did not have a fundamental right to receive electric service from the Town; (2) Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Co. &sect; 7-210(d) (1998) gave the Commission power to determine if the corporation's service area should be modified because the Town annexed land that was located in the service area; and (3) the record supported the Commission's judgment that the public interest would not be served by transferring electric service rights in the area that was annexed from the corporation to the Town.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's drug and alcohol troubles had led to a short incarceration during a period when the maternal grandmother was unable to look after the children, and they stayed with friends of the grandmother. When the mother returned, after six weeks, the friends sought to keep the younger child. By the time a master made findings, the mother had satisfactorily addressed her substance abuse problems, and the trial court adopted the master's recommendations that the mother receive custody, conditioned on seeking housing in a particular family shelter community and on allowing visitation with a sibling who remained with the friends, at their home. The high court held, first, that even though the mother had not timely appealed the original order, she had timely appealed the motion to strike the conditions, and since it interfered with her exercise of custody, it was immediately appealable under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-303. The high court further held that custody awards to fit parents had to be accorded final effect. The conditions themselves violated the mother's due process guarantees, under the Troxel decision, to raise her children as she saw fit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order denying emergency relief from the conditions, and remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to modify all conditions attached to its previous custody award. All other issues were moot.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) affirmed the decision. The owner appealed to the appellate court, but a writ of certiorari was issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that Md. Ann. Code art. 2B, &sect; 11-304(d)(2) relating to ceasing operations, serving food, and providing entertainment between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., violated Md. Const. art. XI-A, known as the Home Rule Amendment. The owner also presented a statutory interpretation issue concerning the applicability of Md. Ann. Code art. 2B, &sect; 11-304(d)(2) and a federal constitutional challenge to Md. Ann. Code art. 2B, &sect; 11-304(d)(2) based upon the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The reviewing court found that, under Md. Ann. Code 2B, &sect; 11-304(d)(2), the owner was a licensee with a B-D-7 license and had to cease all operations between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. Further, the entertainment offered by tavern was dancing to music provided by disc jockeys, and as such it was not activity protected by the First Amendment. Finally, there was a rational basis for the classification contained in Md. Ann. Code 2B, &sect; 11-304(d), which was all that was required under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a doctor, appealed, by writ of certiorari, from the affirmance by the Maryland Court of Special Appeals of a trial court's entry of summary judgment for respondents, a hospital and the parties to the hospital's decision denying the doctor privileges, in the doctor's suit alleging breach of contract and several torts, and seeking a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital argued that its credentialing decision should be upheld if it was supported by substantial evidence and made in conformity with its bylaws. The state's highest court held that if the hospital's decision was made in conformity with its legal bylaws, its action was entitled to the deference due any internal corporate decision. If there was not a dispute as to the material fact that the hospital followed its bylaws, the hospital might be entitled to summary judgment under the standard set out in the civil procedure rules. The hospital's argument that as a private, non-profit hospital it was a quasi-public entity, and its decision should be given the deference accorded to an administrative agency's action, was rejected. Credentialing decisions by a private hospital did not constitute administrative agency action and were not subject to substantial evidence review. However, the hospital had the right to control its staffing procedures without the trial court's interference. If the gravamen of the doctor's action was the credentialing decision itself, and a resolution would require a determination of whether the decision was right or fair, the action simply would not lie.</SPAN></P>

The case was remanded to the intermediate court with instructions to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The state department conceded the point, but it argued that the section was inapplicable to the termination of a probationary employee. The state department submitted that such terminations were not firings for misconduct. On appeal, the court found that Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect; 11-303, rather than &sect; 11-106 applied to probationary terminations. Therefore, the employee could be terminated without regard to &sect; 11-106.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the statutory scheme under which he was sentenced to death was unconstitutional because it allowed a jury to impose that sentence by finding by a preponderance of the evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt, that aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating circumstances. The court of appeals held a United States Supreme Court decision requiring a jury to decide, beyond a reasonable doubt, if a defendant was eligible to receive the death penalty applied only to the eligibility phase of a capital sentencing proceeding, wherein the jury decided if a statutorily specified aggravating circumstance, making defendant eligible for the death penalty, was shown beyond a reasonable doubt. This requirement was complied with in defendant's case, as a required aggravating circumstance was found beyond a reasonable doubt. This principle did not apply to the phase of the capital sentencing proceeding where the jury decided if the death penalty should be imposed by weighing aggravating circumstances against mitigating circumstances. The State was constitutionally free to allow this determination to be made by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's intended expert witness at trial, a chemist, was not allowed to testify because the trial court determined that the expert witness did not have a sufficient factual basis upon which to base his opinion as to the quality controls employed in the county police drug analysis laboratory or the specific testing of the suspected cocaine evidence in defendant's case. Defendant argued that the improper exclusion of his expert witness's proffered testimony was caused by the State's improper refusal of his requests during pre-trial discovery to provide certain information and documents regarding the procedures at the laboratory and the trial judge's denial of his motion to compel the State to provide that information and documents. On appeal, the court found that because defendant was entitled to some of the withheld information and documents, the basis for the trial judge's exclusion of the expert witness's testimony was erroneous. Furthermore, the court concluded that the error was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari review to defendant's appeal from an affirmance, by the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland, of her conviction of disorderly conduct in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 121(b)(3) (1996 &amp; 2001 Supp.), recodified at Md. Code Ann., Crim. &sect; 10-201(c)(3) (2002) and resisting arrest. She argued that the evidence was insufficient to convict her because she had been engaged in protected speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant went to the public hospital where she had formerly worked to collect her final paycheck, a mix-up sent her back and forth between departments, and when a hospital police officer finally brought the check but insisted on taking it to human resources first, she exploded in loud obscenities. When she refused to lower her voice, he finally arrested her. The high court found no clear error in the trial court's determination that defendant had violated &sect; 121. Maryland courts looked to three factors in determining whether a limitation on speech was permissible: whether the regulation was content-based or neutral, the surrounding circumstances, including location, and whether less disruptive alternatives were available. There was plenty of evidence that the officer's actions were directed to the volume of defendant's tirade, not the obscene language. The incident in occurred in a hospital, where people expected their privacy to be respected. Finally, defendant could have delivered the same words in a lower voice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari to an appeal by petitioner Comptroller of the Maryland Treasury from an affirmance, by the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland, of a trial court's affirmance of an administrative decision setting aside an assessment against respondent restaurants for alleged underpayments of county admissions and amusement taxes imposed under Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 4-102 (1997).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue was whether the tax court, an administrative agency, had committed legal error when it interpreted the language &quot;in connection with entertainment&quot; in the statutory definition of when localities and a stadium authority could impose a tax on admissions and amusement receipts, at Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 4-101(b)(1) (1997), to require an actual financial nexus between the amounts charged and the entertainment provided. The court found no error in the interpretation as applied to the case of two restaurants that provided live entertainment in some rooms on some nights, but charged no cover, did not change their food and drink prices, and paid the musicians pre-set rates. Finding the term ambiguous, it looked to the legislative history of and case law interpreting both the Maryland statute and the long-repealed federal cabaret excise tax, once codified at 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1700(e)(1), to find that mere incursion of overhead to pay musicians was insufficient. The court found it significant that Maryland's statute had not been amended when Congress had amended the federal statute to broaden its reach nor in response to lower court decisions in the case before it.</SPAN></P>

Section 11-4A(a) stated that it was unlawful for merchants to offer or sell certain future services contracts, and allowed County employees to regulate the sale of future services contracts in cases where performance of a contract occurred primarily in Montgomery County or, regardless of where performance occurred, when the contract was signed in Montgomery County. A business that sold health club services and a business that sold ballroom dance lessons sued the County, arguing that the ordinance violated the Maryland and United States Constitutions. The state supreme court held that because &sect; 11-4A substantially affected people and entities located outside Montgomery County, many of whom had little or no connection with Montgomery County, it was not a local law, and the Montgomery County Council exceeded its powers under Md.

Md. Code Ann., Corr.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The terms of defendant's first degree murder sentence were ambiguous, so defendant was resentenced to a term of 50 years' imprisonment. Defendant contended that his sentence should have been construed as a flat 50 years, rather than life with all but 50 years suspended, because the pronouncement of his sentence by the judge was ambiguous, and under the rule of lenity he was entitled to the less severe sentence. The intermediate appellate court concluded, however, that, although defendant's sentence was illegal, the sentence was corrected by extrajudicial communications between the sentencing judge and the Chairman of the Maryland Parole Commission, so that defendant's sentence was life with all but 50 years suspended. The court of appeals found that the sentence imposed upon defendant during his resentencing was for a straight 50 years, which was illegal. Defendant's sentence, however, was never corrected properly because there was never a hearing on the record or notice provided to the parties, as was required by Md. R. 744(c). Consequently, the circuit court's commitment order and the Maryland Department of Correction's sentence change report were of no legal force or effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owner appealed from a judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which affirmed the trial court's affirmance of a decision by the county board of zoning appeals, denying the owner's request for a zoning variance in order to construct a hunting camp on his property. The denial was based on a finding that the property was located within a Critical Area Buffer (CAB).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought to build a hunting camp on land that he owned, much of which was within the CAB. He consulted with experts and county officials and modified his plans on where to locate the camp buildings in order to have the most minimal adverse impact on the environment. However, the modified variance request was denied by the board. On appeal through two levels of courts, that determination was affirmed. However, on further appeal, the court found that the board's determination was not supported by empirical data, did not refute the owner's experts' studies and reports, and was accordingly deemed arbitrary and capricious. The court held that the board had used the unconstitutional takings standard, which was error, because the board was required to determine whether an unwarranted hardship existed, and whether the owner's intended use was reasonable and significant, using the criteria of Wicimo County, Md., Code &sect;&sect; 125-35, -36. The board's finding that the owner's situation was a self-induced hardship was error, as was its reliance on the cumulative negative impact theory. It was noted that findings with respect to the criteria listed in &sect; 125-36 were required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of the special appeals court, directed that court to vacate the decision of the trial court, and further directed the trial court to vacate the decision of the board. The trial court was also directed to remand the case to the board for reconsideration of the owner's variance request.</SPAN></P>

In response, the insurance company filed an action against the insured, seeking a judgment declaring that it was not liable because the accident occurred before October 1, 2001, when Md.

The state supreme court held that (1) automobile accidents were a prime source of injuries suffered by parents and children due to the negligence of the other, and it was entirely reasonable for the legislature to provide some measure of redress for such injuries while preserving parent-child immunity in other contexts; (2) Section 5-806(b) applied to claims filed on or after October 1, 2001, even if the incident which gave rise to the claim occurred before that date; and (3) neither the Maryland Constitution nor the United States Constitution prohibited retroactive application of &sect; 5-806(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Medicaid benefits recipient sued defendants, state officials and the bank which was allegedly to disburse to Maryland funds tobacco companies paid under a settlement. She sought relief under the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396 et seq., alleging that she and other victims of tobacco-related illness were entitled to some of the settlement funds. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, dismissed the case, and she appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The recipient argued that the money that Maryland was to receive from the tobacco industry exceeded what it had paid on behalf of Medicaid recipients like her who suffered from smoking-related injuries, and that the excess recovery belonged to her and others similarly situated. The trial court dismissed on grounds of sovereign immunity. This was error, held the appellate court; the defense of immunity was unavailable in actions for declaratory or injunctive relief against state officials by eligible persons under the Medicaid program who claimed that state practices violated the Medicaid Act. However, in light of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396b(d)(3) (the 1999 amendment to the Medicaid Act), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396k(b), which provided for payment of funds recovered from third parties to Medicaid recipients, was not applicable to the settlement of the litigation between Maryland and the tobacco industry. The recipient, and all others similarly situated, were not entitled to any future proceeds paid to the State under the settlement agreement with the tobacco industry. However, the recipient was entitled to a declaratory judgment, albeit one that was adverse to her position.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the appellate court ruled in favor of defendants on the merits of this controversy, it vacated the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case to that court for the entry of a declaratory judgment consistent with the appellate court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After qualifying as a minor political party, the political party sought to nominate a candidate as its candidate for election to the United States Congress. Under the Maryland statutes, the political party was limited to a nomination via a second petition signed by at least one percent of the total number of registered voters in the congressional district. The Board notified the political party that the candidate's name would not be included on the general election ballot because the petition contained an inadequate number of voters, as many of the voters who signed the petition were listed as inactive. The court of appeals, in reaching its conclusion, found that certain provisions in the Maryland Election Code, Md. Ann. Code art. 33, &sect; 1-101 et seq. (1997, 2002 Supp.), and practices by the Board were invalid, based entirely upon Md. Const. art. I and Md. Const. Decl. Rights arts. 7, 24. Further, the second petitioning requirement applicable to minor political parties' candidates discriminated against those parties and candidates in violation of the equal protection component of Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24.</SPAN></P>

After conviction the trial court remarked that defendant would have faced serious sentences if he had proceeded with a jury trial and been convicted. Defendant argued that his rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 21 had been violated in that he had been coerced into waiving a jury trial. The high court held that while a defendant could not be coerced by sentencing promises into giving up the right to a jury trial, there was no indication in the record that the trial court had been involved in the deal in any way. Therefore, there could have been no coercion under the facts of the case, no matter what the judge said afterward.</SPAN></P>

The Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals (MSBCA) dismissed the contractor's appeal on grounds that its notice of claim to the SHA was untimely. The circuit court reversed and remanded, but the Maryland Court of Special Appeals reversed the circuit court's judgment. The contractor sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor, which was awarded a contract to remove lead-based paint and repaint bridges, sought additional money from the SHA due to additional costs incurred in complying with Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations. The contractor timely sought review of the SHA's denial of its claim. The MSBCA made 15 findings of fact before summarily dismissing the appeal. The instant court held that the MSBCA violated procedures set forth in its enabling statute by summarily dismissing the appeal in the absence of adopted rules of procedure. The MSBCA was directed by Md. Code Ann., State Fin. &amp; Proc. &sect; 15-210 (1974, 2002 Repl. Vol.) to adopt regulations, yet it failed to do so with regard to summary disposition. The issue of untimely notice to the SHA was a defense and a factual question to be determined after a full hearing on the merits and not a jurisdictional bar to the contractor's claim. As the contractor filed the appeal of the denial of its claim within 30 days of its receipt of the notice of a final action of the SHA, the MSBCA had jurisdiction to hear the contractor's claim on the merits under Md. Code Ann., State Fin. &amp; Proc. &sect; 15-220 (1974, 2002 Repl. Vol.).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Calvert County (Maryland) of first degree murder. The circuit court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment. After defendant's direct appeal was denied, the motions judge denied defendant's motion for post-conviction relief. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals reversed the decision and remanded the case for a new sentencing hearing. The State filed a petition for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that because the trial judge failed to mention the possibility of suspension of sentence, and stated instead that his discretion was limited to the imposition of the statutory penalty of life imprisonment, the trial judge must not have realized that he had the power to suspend the life sentence or a portion of it. Defendant, therefore, argued that he was entitled to be sentenced anew so that a sentencing judge could consider the possibility of a suspended sentence. The intermediate appellate court agreed with defendant, finding that the trial judge failed to recognize that he had the discretion to suspend all or part of defendant's sentence. The court of appeals found that the only lawful sentence that could have been imposed for murder in the first degree under the controlling statute at the time of the sentencing was life imprisonment; no discretion was lodged in the sentencing judge and the imposition of any other sentence would have plainly been illegal. The sentencing judge's statement, therefore, was legally correct in its historical context, and, reflected an implicit knowledge of the case law regarding sentencing in murder cases in Maryland at that time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Maryland Commission on Human Resources, upon a writ of certiorari, appealed from a judgment entered by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) remanding the Commission's action seeking to enforce an administrative subpoena to the Commission to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether it had subject matter jurisdiction. Motions for reconsideration by appellee employer and the Commission had been denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission argued that its subpoena was enforceable, as the employer was an employer under Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, &sect; 15(b). It was undisputed that the subpoena complied with Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, &sect; 11(d). The State's highest court held that the trial court's authority to remand a case to the Commission was limited to actions for judicial review of final administrative decisions under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-222(a) and (h)(1) (1999). In a subpoena enforcement action, the trial court's authority was to either enforce the subpoena, to enforce it as modified, or to dismiss the petition for enforcement. Whether the employer was an employer under the statute was not a jurisdictional question, but was a statutory interpretation issue to be determined by a final administrative decision and to be judicially reviewed in an action under &sect; 10-222. Even if the disputed issue was jurisdictional, the Commission was clearly not acting &quot;palpably without jurisdiction&quot; in investigating the employee's complaints. A final ruling as to whether the employer was a statutory employer was not a prerequisite for the subpoena's enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court with instructions to enter an order enforcing the subpoena.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) of first-degree premeditated murder, robbery with a deadly weapon, and conspiracy to commit robbery with a deadly weapon. Defendant elected a court sentencing proceeding. The trial court imposed a death sentence for the murder conviction, and imposed consecutive 20-year sentences of imprisonment as to each of the other two convictions. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an 18-year-old, and two teenage accomplices entered a fast food restaurant after hours. They stole money from the restaurant and beat the person attending the restaurant to death because he could identify defendant, as defendant had been fired from working at the restaurant a month earlier. They then left in a stolen vehicle. The sentencing court found that the statutory aggravator of committing the murder during an armed carjacking existed. Upon examining the mitigating factors, the sentencing court found that defendant had no prior conviction for a crime of violence and was not the sole proximate cause of the victim's death; however, the court denied the youthful age and the unlikelihood that defendant would engage in future criminal activity that would constitute a continuing threat to society mitigators. The high court found that defendant failed to present evidence to establish the future threat to society mitigator. However, the sentencing court erred by not finding by a preponderance of the evidence that youthful age was a mitigating circumstance. Consequently, the ultimate weighing of the aggravating versus the mitigating factors was inadequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed except as to the imposition of the death sentence. The death sentence was vacated, and the case was remanded to the circuit court for a new sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firefighters were state employees. The court of appeals held, under Md.

The requirement that the firefighters be members of the Maryland Air National Guard was a classification standard, which, under Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect; 12-101(b)(2)(v), could not be the subject of a grievance. Although &quot;classification standard&quot; was not statutorily defined, it was a standard created by the Secretary of the Department of Budget and Management (Secretary) for the guidance of individual agencies, and encompassed requirements, approved by the Secretary, to which all class members were subject. The National Guard requirement was enacted pursuant to the procedure for establishing a class, and the firefighters could not grieve the establishment of a class or a classification standard used in such establishment, under Md. Code Ann., State Pers. &amp; Pens. &sect; 12-102(b)(iii) and (v). Preventing their grievance action did not necessarily preclude them from seeking redress for their perceived injuries.</SPAN></P>

Code art. 27, &sect; 36B (1996, 2001 Cum. Supp.), the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) reversed on grounds that the evidence had been insufficient to convict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was driving a car he had rented, was stopped for speeding. Smelling burnt marijuana, police arrested defendant and his two passengers, and in searching the vehicle's trunk, found a handgun underneath a jacket. One of the passengers admitted owning the jacket, but no one claimed to own the gun. There was direct access to the trunk from the back seat via a fold-down rear seat. The trial court found that defendant, as the driver of the car, knew of the gun's presence, and was at least in constructive possession of it. The instant court noted that an appellate court was obliged to defer to the fact-finder's resolution of conflicting evidentiary inferences. It framed the issue as whether, from the various permissible inferences from uncontested facts, it was rational for the trial judge to have found that defendant knew he was transporting a handgun. It held that it was rational for the trial court to find that defendant had such knowledge. It also held, as a general rule of law, that the status of a defendant as driver of a vehicle permitted a fact-finder to infer that the defendant knew of contraband found in that vehicle.</SPAN></P>

The State's highest court held that the intermediate court improperly found inadequate procedural safeguards to minimize the occurrence of defamatory statements. The teacher could appeal to the county school board and to the Maryland State Board of Education. The teacher also had a right to a second appeal to the Maryland State Board of Education, a right to a hearing, and a right to judicial review of the State Board's final administrative decision. The State Board and judicial review proceedings were governed by the Maryland State Administrative Procedure Act, Md. Code Ann., St. Gov't &sect;&sect; 10-201 through 10-226. The criticism of the procedural safeguards in that the defamation had occurred in the students' initial complaint was rejected, as it would apply to all cases in which a complaint was made about government personnel, where the complaint initiated an administrative proceeding. The trial court correctly held that the defamation action was barred by an absolute privilege.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the Court of Special Appeals' holding that the institution's directive that was violated implicated the Accardi doctrine, but also implicated the Accardi doctrine exception. The institution's directive merely provided for the orderly transaction of the institution's business of collecting and handling urine specimens. The directive implicated no fundamental constitutional rights and was not imposed on the agency by statute. Moreover, the probationer was not prejudiced in the way the sample was handled and by the board's consideration of the positive urinalysis sample which was submitted by him. The institution's staff were generally following the directive, but committed purely technical infractions. Therefore, the probationer failed to demonstrate prejudice from the infractions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought to have the evidence seized suppressed under the exclusionary rule, as he contended that the no-knock search violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The State argued that the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule applied. On appeal, the court found that because application of the inevitable discovery doctrine to the facts of the case would read the knock and announce requirement of the Fourth Amendment out of the U.S. Constitution and, thus, permit forcible and unannounced entry in every search pursuant to a valid warrant, whether exigent circumstances existed or not, the evidence should have been suppressed because the no-knock search violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

That judgment reversed adoption of Rockville, Md., Zoning Ordinance 10-99 because the manner of rezoning constituted improper conditional and spot zoning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The annexation agreement placed the subject property in the city's I-1 zone, under certain conditions. The court first addressed Md. Ann. Code art. 23A, &sect; 9(c) (1957, 1998 Repl. Vol.) and concluded, in part, that the proper interpretation of &sect; 9(c) was that a municipality could not zone, for a five year period, newly annexed lands to a zone substantially different from the pre-annexation jurisdiction's plan recommendation, without express approval of the pre-annexation jurisdiction. Second, it examined when Md. Ann. Code art. 66B, &sect; 4.01(c) (1957, 1998 Repl. Vol., 2001 Supp.) authorized conditional zoning by the city. It found that conditional zoning which acted as a limitation as to otherwise permissible uses was not permitted. Because the city endeavored to foreclose, by limitation pertaining only to the subject property, all of the otherwise permitted commercial retail uses, and impliedly those commercial retail uses, other than a gasoline service station, allowed by special exception, in the I-1 Zone, the court held the Rockville, Md., Zoning Ordinance No. 10-99 to be impermissible conditional zoning. The subject property retained its prior county classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From the time the attorney discovered that his teen-aged son had committed a murder, he acted to hold off the police investigation, during which time he arranged his son's flight to Israel. The attorney testified to a grand jury that he acted in the belief that his son had acted in self-defense and to prevent his son from committing suicide, but, by the time of the disciplinary proceeding the father had also fled to Israel. The high court found no clear error in the hearing judge's determination that the attorney had violated Md. R. Prof. Conduct 8.4(b), (d) by engaging in conduct indicating his unfitness to practice and by obstructing justice. The attorney had committed all the elements of common law obstructing or hindering a police officer and would have been arrested if he had not fled. Since the high court had often disbarred people for far less serious offenses, it had no hesitation in disbarring the attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the agency petitioned for guardianship and termination, the trial court waived notice to the mother. The court of appeals held, under Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-322(b), the agency could only be relieved of its obligation to notify the mother if it made reasonable good faith efforts to locate her. Given her contacts with personnel from the agency and the juvenile court, during which she was not told of the pendency of a petition to terminate her parental rights, reasonable good faith efforts to notify her were not made. The trial court had to rigorously scrutinize whether the agency made such efforts, when the agency moved to waive notice to her. Its findings erroneously focused on her lack of effort to notify the court of her current address, rather than the agency's efforts to notify her. Under Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-322(a)(1)(ii)(1), the agency had to notify the attorney who represented the mother at the hearing at which the child was adjudicated to be a child in need of assistance of its petition, even though that attorney's appearance had been stricken. This was also required by Md. R. 9-105, and the agency failed to give such notice.</SPAN></P>

R. 4-252, upon finding them insufficient to support the charges. The high court agreed with the State that the trial courts had considered the legal sufficiency of the evidence as well as the sufficiency of the charging instruments in making their decisions, but these errors did not settle the issue of whether the State could still proceed against petitioners and defendant. The high court held, without reaching constitutional double jeopardy issues, that under the Maryland common law doctrine of autrefois acquit, there could be no further proceedings. By considering the sufficiency of the evidence, the trial courts had in effect granted motions to acquit, and once acquittal had occurred, the prosecution was over.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant utilities reargued a case in the Maryland Court of Appeals holding that an order of respondent Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) ignored the clear requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-101 et seq., in light of the enactment of 2002 Md. Laws 494, which purported to retroactively permit the PSC to issue orders notwithstanding the APA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PSC had issued Order No. 76292, which placed requirements on the electric and gas utilities subject to regulation by the PSC and imposed limitations on the relationships that those utilities had with their non-regulated affiliates. The appellate court held that the enactment of 2002 Md. Laws 494 violated the single subject rule of Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 29. There was no connection between the provisions relating to the Public Utility Regulation Fund and those purporting to retroactively excuse the PSC from compliance with the APA. Even if the provisions in 2002 Md. Laws 494 were vertically related, as relating to the broader subject of the efficient operation or effective funding of the PSC, there was nothing in the record to suggest that the legislature viewed those provisions as having that connection, and, even more important, nowhere was that broader subject reflected in the title to 2002 Md. Laws 494. 2002 Md. Laws 494 thus failed both requirements of Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 29. The offending sections were severable and the other parts of the law that related to the funding of the PSC and the Office of People's Counsel remained unaffected by the ruling.</SPAN></P>

The state's highest appellate court held that the failure of the town to raise its LGTCA defense until the end of the injured party's closing argument did not bar the dismissal of the suit. The injured party failed to strictly comply with the notice requirements of the LGTCA, Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-304(a) and (b) (1998, 2001 Supp.), as notice was not sent to the town, as well as in the failure to fully inform the addressee of the notice, the town's insurer, of the time, place, or cause of the injury. However, the state's highest appellate court held that the injured party substantially complied with the LGTCA notice provisions. The injured party made some effort to provide notice. The letter to the insurer contained sufficient information about the accident to enable the insurer to conduct a timely investigation, which it did; the insurer also notified the town that the injured party expected compensation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into written agreements whereby the county agreed to waive the school capacity requirements of the Adequacy of Public Facilities Ordinance, Anne Arundel County, Md., Code art. 26, &sect;&sect; 2-409 to 2-420, in return for the land developers' agreeing to convey land or pay money to help alleviate the school capacity problems caused by the residential developments. Without these agreements, the land developers would not have been able to move forward with the recordation of their subdivisions because the county would not have waived the requirements. The appellate court held that under the voluntary payment doctrine, a party was not allowed to recover money voluntarily paid with a full knowledge of all the facts, although no obligation to make such payment existed. Both parties benefitted from the agreements and the land developers had already received benefits from the agreements. Under the voluntary payment rule, the land developers were not to question the legality of the agreements. Although an exception to the voluntary payment rule existed where recovery was authorized by statute, the land developers had not availed themselves of the tax refund remedy provided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child injured his left hip when he was 10 years old. Surgery was performed on the left hip. Because of complications surgery was later performed on the child's right hip. The child suffered a lifelong disability and would be forced to endure many operations. By answer to the special interrogatories, the jury found that the parents discovered the child's injury in November 1993 and that the child did not discover his injury until 1999, after the action was filed in 1998. The trial court found that the three-year time limit under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-109(a)(2) barred the claim. On review of the certified question, the court found that in light of Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 19, the three- and five-year time periods prescribed by &sect; 5-109(a) did not commence running against the child's claim until he attained the age of 18.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance agent appealed, upon a writ of certiorari, from the affirmance by the Maryland Court of Special Appeals of the reviewing court's affirmance of a decision by the Maryland Insurance Commissioner holding that the agent did not have standing to challenge the termination of her contract with appellee insurer, as the agent was divested of individual standing to pursue the claim, due to her pending bankruptcy case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrative law judge (ALJ) was not advised of the dismissal of the agent's bankruptcy case and ruled that the agent lacked standing based on the bankruptcy. The appellate court held that, for purposes of judicial review of an agency's final decision, the administrative record included the exceptions filed by the agent, noting that the bankruptcy petition was dismissed. The intermediate appellate court erroneously concluded that a reviewing court could not go outside the record compiled by the ALJ to consider the dismissal of the bankruptcy case. The appellate court found that the Associate Deputy Insurance Commissioner, in affirming the decision of the ALJ, failed to make sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law for the appellate court to determine whether there was error in the consideration of the dismissal of the bankruptcy case. Although the order recited that the exceptions were carefully considered, the order deprived the agent of standing to maintain the administrative complaint based on the bankruptcy case. If the new evidence was admitted and considered, it would have created a material dispute that merited a clearer resolution by the Commissioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the intermediate appellate court was reversed, and the case was remanded to the intermediate appellate court with instructions to reverse the judgment of the reviewing court and to remand the case to the reviewing court with instructions to remand the case to the Maryland Insurance Administration for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of transporting a person for the purposes of prostitution, in violation of former Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 432 (2000 Supp.). He was sentenced and ordered to register as a sex offender. He appealed. The conviction and sentence, including the order to register as a sex offender, were affirmed by judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland). Certiorari was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certiorari was granted to consider whether the statute requiring that certain criminal defendants register as sexual offenders, former Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 432 (2000 Supp.), was a punitive statute that imposed a sanction and triggered the right to a jury trial and the right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt under Apprendi, as well as to consider two evidentiary issues. In deciding that the right to a jury trial was not triggered, the highest appellate court found that the registration statute was not punitive. It did not expose defendant to a greater penalty than the prescribed statutory maximum. It was not unconstitutional, as it did not constitute punishment. It was a remedial requirement for the protection of the public. Defendant's evidentiary arguments were also rejected, as allowing evidence of defendant's statements to the victim to avoid African-American customers did not constitute improper appeals to racial prejudice. The instructions were highly probative of mens rea. Other evidence was relevant to establish the element of transportation. The fact that evidence may have had incidental emotional effects did not render the admission of the evidence erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subscribers challenged the constitutionality of 2000 Md.

The member challenged the constitutionality of 2000 Md. Laws 569, which authorized contract provisions allowing HMO's to be subrogated to a member's cause of action against another party. On appeal, the court found that the retrospective portions of 2000 Md. Laws 59 and 2000 Md. Laws 569 were unconstitutional under Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 19, Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24, and Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 40. The retrospective portions of both statutes clearly deprived the subscribers and the member of vested rights.

The individuals sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction concerning the validity and enforceability of a Maryland medical assistance regulation, Md. Regs.

The county had the authority to enact the Act. Because the Act did not interfere with state interests, the Act was a local law. The Act did not infringe upon the legislature's ability to regulate marriage on a statewide basis. The county had the power to regulate local employment, including that of its employees. No Maryland statute expressly preempted the ordinance at issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was accused of unauthorized use of criminal justice records; falsely accusing co-workers of misconduct, neglect, and emotional disorders; and of threatening to physically harm a co-worker. An administrative law judge found that the MdTA proved these charges, and recommended the employee's termination. The department of budget and management followed the recommendation. The court of special appeals reversed the firing, because (1) the MdTA failed to follow its own regulations, and (2) firing was too severe a sanction for the employee's misconduct. The instant court reversed this ruling. First, the MdTa did not violate its own regulations: when it first learned of alleged misconduct deemed sufficiently serious to require termination, it was not obliged to immediately terminate the employee. Second, judicial review of an administratively imposed sanction was not authorized by either the Administrative Procedure Act nor general Maryland administrative law principles. And even if termination was disproportionate to the employee's misconduct, it was not so disproportionate as to be &quot;arbitrary or capricious&quot; under Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a police officer, appealed, by a writ of certiorari, from the Maryland Court of Special Appeals' affirmance of a circuit court's affirmance of his termination by a county police chief, alleging that the wrong standard of review was applied under the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights (LEOBR), Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 727 et seq. (1996, Supp. 1998). Respondent, a county police department, filed a conditional cross-petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the appropriate standard of proof in an action under the LEOBR was a preponderance of the evidence, even for the theft-related offenses charged.  Everett v. Balt. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., 307 Md. 286 (1986) was overruled. The officer was afforded the panoply of rights provided by the LEOBR. The LEOBR procedures adequately protected the officer against an erroneous deprivation of his due process claims. Implementation of a heightened standard of proof would not so significantly reduce the risk of error that it should have been implemented regardless of any additional administrative or financial burdens it would entail. A preponderance of the evidence standard, added to the array of other protections under the LEOBR, struck the appropriate balance between protecting the private interests of an officer accused of misconduct and a law enforcement agency's interest in maintaining internal discipline. Thus, the correct evidentiary standard to be applied under LEOBR in local police agency cases was the preponderance of the evidence standard.</SPAN></P>

Before the jury, the person stated his name and birth date, stood next to defendant, and was excused. The trial court refused to instruct the jury that the witness had exercised his right to remain silent and refused to admit inculpatory statements the witness made to another person, finding the declarant unreliable. The court of appeals ruled the trial court erred by not admitting the inculpatory statements against penal interest and allowing the jury to determine the declarant's credibility. The trial court should have determined if defendant would be unfairly prejudiced by not allowing him to call the potentially exculpatory witness who would invoke his self-incrimination privilege in the jury's presence. If the trial court found there was sufficient evidence the proposed witness might have committed the crime, it had discretion to allow defendant to call the witness, and, if it did not allow the witness to be called, it should have instructed the jury that the witness invoked his self-incrimination privilege.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held he had, on request, to be permitted a reasonable opportunity to consult counsel, as long as this would not substantially interfere with the timely and efficacious administration of the test. He did not have to execute any writing to consent to testing. His decision to exercise his due process right to contact counsel was not necessarily a conditional nor a per se refusal to submit to the test, and his exercise of this right was distinct from an assessment of whether he refused the test. His presence in his vehicle, sitting in the driver's seat, awake, and with the engine running, indicated he could attempt to drive the vehicle and was in control of it, for purposes of the statutory definition of the term &quot;drive&quot; in Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner purchased the property aware of property restrictions for the area. The board ruled that the purchase, with knowledge, precluded the granting of a variance, because it was considered a self-created hardship. In disagreeing, the highest appellate court found that while a purchaser of property acquired no greater right to a variance than his predecessor, he also did not acquire less. The right to a variance was not affected by a sale of the land, as to hold otherwise would be inconsistent with the general property-law goal of preserving alienability. The type of hardship that would normally be considered to be self-created did not arise from the purchase of the property, but rather from the actions of a landowner himself that created the hardship. In the instant case, the property was in a &quot;buffer&quot; zone adjacent to wetlands. The landowner, when purchasing the property, knew that variances from the county's zoning provisions would be required in order to build the house it desired. It was error for the court below to find that the purchase was a self-created hardship, since the landowner did nothing to create the situation, other than purchase the property.</SPAN></P>

The commission obtained a preliminary injunction preventing construction activity on the property. The trial court determined the value of the land subject to its denial of certain evidence relating to lost profits. The developer appealed the decision of the Maryland Court of Special Appeals which affirmed the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission wanted to convert the parcel of land into a park. The developer had declined the commission's offers and began construction on the parcel. The commission obtained the injunction based upon its assertion that the developer was tearing out trees, which irreparably damaged the parcel. In addition it asserted allowing development to continue would have increased its cost to obtain the land. The appellate court held the lower appellate court erred, as the commission did not have &quot;quick take&quot; authority; rather, it had &quot;regular&quot; authority. Thus, the trial court erred in granting the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The trial court's grant of the commission's second motion in limine wrongfully precluded the developer from presenting evidence that may have affected the jury's assessment of the fair market value of the land at the time of trial. The developer's right to develop the property and to just compensation greatly outweighed the commission's speculative showing as to its interest in retaining the affected trees and vegetation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that respondent, a workers' compensation claimant who retired as a result of his disability, failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by failing to request a hearing on the decision of the SRPS to offset the claimant's workers' compensation benefits against his disability retirement benefits. As a result, the reviewing court never should have entertained the claimant's petition for mandamus. Furthermore, the reviewing court's orders permitting the claimant to collect both workers' compensation and disability retirement benefits was in contravention of the statutory mandate contained in Md.

Government employees covered by both workers' compensation and a pension or retirement plan providing equivalent disability benefits could only obtain a single recovery for a single injury.

After defendant was convicted of an offense that qualified under this statute, the trial court held that as applied to defendant, whose offenses were not violent and who possessed relatively small quantities of drugs, the sentencing statute violated federal and state constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. The high court held that the punishment was not grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of the offense and was therefore constitutional. Defendant cross-appealed that he was entitled to jury determination of his sentencing enhancement, but the court held that a prior prison term was akin to a prior conviction, an enhanced sentencing factor not covered by the constitutional rule of Apprendi.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in 1992, after a jury trial, of first degree murder with a deadly weapon and the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. After electing to be sentenced by the court and not the jury, he was sentenced to death. Circuit Court for Harford County (Maryland) judgments denied his motions for new sentencing based on newly discovered evidence and mistake or irregularity. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of first degree murder and also, upon defendant's specific request that it address the issue, found beyond a reasonable doubt defendant was the principal actor, an aggravating circumstance that made defendant eligible for the death penalty. Defendant was not able to show any mitigating circumstances that outweighed the aggravating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence (previously held to be a constitutional standard); therefore, the circuit court was authorized to sentence defendant to death. Apprendi did not apply to Maryland's sentencing scheme since death was the maximum penalty provided for by the statute governing first degree murder and so the death sentence was not an enhancement of the maximum penalty. The indictment was a valid indictment for a capital case. Defendant was substantially provided with the information of the charges and that the State was seeking the death penalty. Defendant was sufficiently advised before making his voluntary waiver of his right to be sentenced by the jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother filed a medical malpractice action in her own right and in behalf of her daughter against defendant obstetrician. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) dismissed the claims filed in behalf of the daughter and a jury found that the mother had contributed to causing her own injury. The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland affirmed the trial court's judgment, and the state supreme court granted leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mother filed a malpractice action, alleging that an obstetrician failed to inform her that blood test results indicated a heightened possibility her unborn child had Down's Syndrome. Evidence showed that the mother's doctor referred her to the obstetrician in February 1995, but she did not make an appointment to see him until March 29, 1995. When the obstetrician saw her on April 19, 1995, he ordered an alpha-fetoprotein blood test. However, the mother did not have that test done until May 16, 1995, and the obstetrician did not receive the test results until May 25, 1995. By the time the obstetrician received the test results and discussed them with the mother, she was too far into her pregnancy to obtain an abortion in Maryland, although she could have obtained an abortion in New York, Kansas, or Arkansas. The mother carried the child to term and it was born with Downs Syndrome. The state supreme court held that (1) the facts supported the jury's verdict that the mother's negligence contributed to the delay in detecting Downs Syndrome; and (2) Maryland would follow the majority of states which do not allow parents to sue in behalf of a child for wrongful life.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employees and former employee of a state agency sued the Secretary of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services for monetary damages based on their allegations that they were not paid for overtime work in excess of 40 hours per week. They asserted that the failure to pay them for overtime work violated the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 201-219.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees, after being dismissed from federal court, brought suit in state court. The employees stated their action was authorized by two provisions of the FLSA, namely 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 215(a)(3), 216(b). They alternatively contended that their action was authorized by Maryland law. The secretary moved to dismiss, arguing that the state's sovereign immunity barred the federal causes of action and that congress had no authority to abrogate that immunity by authorizing suits of that nature against a state official in state courts. The trial court agreed with the secretary. The lower Court of Special Appeals reversed the trial court. The higher appellate court then rejected the secretary's contention that the issues of Maryland law, added by its order, should not be reached. Covered state employees were entitled to overtime compensation in accordance with applicable state law or the FLSA, whichever was greater. There was a duty on the part of the state or the appropriate officials to make such payments or provide for them through the budget process, and sovereign immunity was not a defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held Maryland provided a statutory administrative and judicial review remedy for adjudication of the employees' claims and the remedy was exclusive. Because the lawsuit was not encompassed by the exclusive statutory administrative and judicial review remedy, the trial court correctly dismissed the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A marijuana cigarette was found inside of a pack of cigarettes, which was inside defendant's lunch bag. The higher appellate court found that the search of the lunch bag was a lawful search incident to arrest. In the instant case, police evidence showed that a copy of the arrest warrant had been served on defendant. Also, the police had relied on the existence of the warrant. The fact the State did not produce the underlying arrest warrant at the suppression hearing did not obviate the lawfulness of the arrest. In addition, defendant had consented to the search of her lunch bag. Her contention that the police exceeded the scope of what otherwise would have been a lawful search, by searching the open pack of cigarettes within her lunch bag, was also rejected. The higher appellate court found that the search of an inner container, of a container within a container, was lawful where the search of the outside container was lawful. The Fourth Amendment only prohibited unreasonable searches and seizures. The search and seizure in the instant case was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The high court held that this proceeding did not violate the constitutional rule of Apprendi, which required facts (other than prior convictions) that increased a sentence beyond the statutory maximum to be found beyond a reasonable doubt, both because the United States Supreme Court had excluded death penalty cases from his opinion and because a death sentence was the statutory maximum for defendant's offense.

The Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed. The Maryland Court of Appeals granted the subcontractor's petition for writ of certiorari as to whether Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 9-104(f)(3) (1998, 2001 Supp.), applied to an addition to an existing single family dwelling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment in favor of the homeowners was granted because they had paid the contractor in full. The appellate court found that the mechanic's lien law historically had been construed in the most liberal and comprehensive manner in favor of mechanics and materialmen. The mechanic's lien statute, however, contained a homeowners' exception, that limited the homeowners' liability to a subcontractor for work performed and materials rendered by the subcontractor on a single family dwelling erected on the owner's land for his own residence, to the extent that the owner rendered payment to the contractor. The appellate court reasoned that by the time a mechanic's lien notice was received, the homeowner may already have paid the contractor or have accumulated set-offs or credits exceeding what is owed on the contract. Generally, courts had hesitated to construe the mechanic's lien statute against homeowners. Thus, the appellate court held that Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 9-104(f)(3) (1998, 2001 Supp.) applied to an addition to an existing home, as well as the construction of a new home.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) entered an order denying petitioner juvenile's motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him for lack of jurisdiction. The juvenile filed an interlocutory appeal in the appellate court. On its own motion, the state's highest court granted the juvenile's petition for certiorari before judgment and his motion for injunction pending appeal, prior to a determination by the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the juvenile inquired whether the juvenile court had the authority to rescind an order of waiver of juvenile jurisdiction and, if so, whether the circuit court lacked jurisdiction; and whether an immediate appeal could be taken under the collateral order doctrine from the order denying his motion to dismiss the criminal charges. The state's highest court held that the denial of the juvenile's motion to dismiss was not immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine, because it did not satisfy at least one of the elements of the four-pronged test, i.e., the element which required it to be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. To the contrary, such a denial of a motion to dismiss was completely reviewable on appeal; the Maryland Legislature had so provided. The state's highest court also determined that the juvenile's inquiry as to the appropriateness of the order of waiver of juvenile jurisdiction was not yet reviewable on appeal. This determination was consistent with the Maryland Legislature's intent that a challenge to a waiver of juvenile jurisdiction await the final disposition of the particular matter in the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to suppress evidence obtained in a knock and talk where the police obtained entry to his motel room without either a warrant, probable cause to believe, or a reasonable articulable suspicion that there was any illegal activity at the motel. The appellate court was not prepared to find every late-night knock and talk encounter a Fourth Amendment seizure. Nor was the knock and talk a violation of Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 26, which Maryland courts had consistently construed as being in pari materia with the Fourth Amendment. The voluntariness of consent to a search was a question of fact, to be determined from a totality of the circumstances. The trial court did not commit any error of law or any clear error of fact in determining that defendant consented to the search of his room and that the consent was voluntary. The evidence, in a light most favorable to the State, showed no police overbearing, or even impoliteness. The court refused to follow Washington and New Jersey, which required the police to notify occupants of their right to refuse their consent based on the state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge acquitted him of the stalking charge, but found him guilty of the harassment charge. The inmate appealed, contending that the statute under which he was convicted, Md. Ann Code art. 27, &sect; 123, was unconstitutional, and that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction. The interim court affirmed, and the inmate again appealed. The appellate court found that whether the statute should be tested for vagueness on its face was immaterial; the statute survived the void-for-vagueness doctrine whether it was scrutinized using the agreed facts in the case alone or employing the imagined facts of marginal cases which were cited by the inmate in opposition to the statute.

A Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) judgment affirmed a circuit court decision vacating and remanding the commission's order. The commission was granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals determined that (1) the record contained substantial evidence to support the commission's decision that the administrator had violated Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 15-607, by not disclosing employment of family members, and (2) that his conduct with regard to the recruitment, hiring, promoting, and supervising of his family members as employees of the elections board violated the tenets of the conflicts of interest provisions set forth in Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect;&sect; 15-501(a), 15-506. The county elections board was a state agency. The need to investigate and sanction alleged ethical violations was acute. There was no evidence to indicate the board had knowledge of or approved the administrator's family hiring. The hiring and payment were discretionary and not excepted ministerial acts. The position openings were not advertised nor was it shown there was a shortage of workers. The public ethics law prohibited state employees from intentionally using their public office prestige for their private gain. In so doing, the instant court was deferential towards the agency's findings of fact and the inferences drawn by the agency from those facts.</SPAN></P>

She sought a declaration that the city's actions violated state constitutional guarantees, but the court held instead that under the plain language of the personnel policies, there was a triable issue of fact as to whether moving existing employees into those positions constituted filling a position to which the former employee had a right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police did not charge defendant with murder and robbery until 15 years after the incident; he was always a suspect, but there was not quite enough evidence to convict until an accomplice agreed to testify.

Speedy trial rights did not attach until a defendant was charged. However, defendant's due process rights were denied when the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to permit cross-examination of the accomplice regarding memory loss problems that allegedly occurred after an intervening injury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) condemned water and sewerage systems (systems) owned by defendant utility. The Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) judgment awarded $ 6.5 million damages, deducting $ 3.2 million in Md. Ann. Code art. 29, &sect; 3-107 contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) from a jury value of $ 9.7 million. The utility and WSSC appealed. WSSC's writ of certiorari petition was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals decided, inter alia, (1) to disallow the CIAC deduction under &sect; 3-107, since the deduction constituted an unlawful taking without just compensation, (2) the jury valuation was supported by evidence of appraisers who opined upon different methodologies, including comparable sales, capitalization of income, and reconstruction cost new less depreciation, and (3) the WSSC's decision to condemn to improve water quality, without proof that the WSSC would achieve that goal, was not arbitrarily or unreasonably made. The valuation issue revolved around the CIAC concept. CIAC was excluded from the utility's rate base to determine utility charges, and to not deduct CIAC would result in customers paying twice for the CIAC component, so the WSSC argued it should be excluded from condemnation valuation. The utility argued that CIAC was part of their property even though derived from purchasers of land or others.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner tenant under residential lease appealed affirmance, by Baltimore City Circuit Court (Maryland), of trial court judgment for respondent landlord for rent arrearages, interest, and attorneys' fees, arguing applicable limitations period was three years, under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-101 (1998), although lease was under seal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Nine years after petitioner co-signed a one-year residential lease, respondent landlord sued him for rent arrearages, interest, and fees. Because the lease had the word &quot;seal&quot; printed on it, the trial court held that it was a specialty instrument under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-102 (1998), subject to a 12-year limitations period. Petitioner argued that the action was time-barred by Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-101 (1998), setting a three-year period for most contracts. The reviewing court looked for the intent of the legislature, and found that since the 18th century, the three-year period had applied to actions on residential leases. When Maryland statutes were recodified in the 1970s, there was no indication of intent to change this rule, only to clarify those that previously existed. In fact, the codifiers strongly suggested that contracts under seal be abolished. Therefore, respondent's action was time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded with instructions to reverse the trial court's judgment. Recodification did not affect applicability of a three-year statute to residential leases in the absence of any indication of legislative intent to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions of three crimes were reversed on appeal and he was retried. The State entered a nolle prosequi as to one of the charges, attempted voluntary manslaughter, and a jury again convicted defendant of first degree assault and using a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed on direct appeal. Defendant's petition for writ of certiorari was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the first trial, defendant was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the assault, 10 years for the attempted manslaughter (to be served concurrent with the assault sentence), and 20 years for the handgun offense (to be served consecutively to the assault sentence). After the second trial, defendant was sentenced to 20 years for the assault and 20 years for the handgun violation, to be served consecutively. Defendant argued that sentencing him to 20 years for the assault was illegal as the assault merged with the attempted voluntary manslaughter. The State argued that the sentence was not illegal because there was no net increase in the original sentence. On certiorari, the appellate court held that the attempted manslaughter merged with the assault under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 12A-1(a)(1) using the required evidence test so that the assault sentence should not have exceeded the attempted manslaughter sentence. Accordingly, after the second trial, the trial court erred in giving a sentence for the assault that was greater than the sentence for attempted manslaughter that was imposed after the first trial, regardless of the nolle prosequi for attempted manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the judgment of the court of special appeals, remanded to the court of special appeals with directions to vacate the sentences imposed by the circuit court and remand the case to the circuit court for a new sentencing proceeding consistent with the appellate opinion, and ordered the costs in the court of appeals and the court of special appeals to be paid by the county in which defendant was convicted.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) granted summary judgment to employee in one case. A jury awarded damages to employees in the other case, but the trial court dismissed a defendant in that case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Employers were a religious school and its principal. Employees were fired because they did not belong to the church which ran the school, and claimed the firing, based as it was on their religious creed, violated a county ordinance prohibiting employment discrimination on that basis. The supreme court held that the common law doctrine of charitable immunity was not a defense to liability imposed by statute and could not be raised by the employers here. The state employment discrimination statute did not pre-empt the county ordinance. However, the county ordinance as written violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment as well as Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 36. The supreme court found that an offensive clause in the statute which limited the application of an exception for religious organizations could be severed, and struck down the clause, thereby leaving the exception allowing religious organizations to hire or fire on the basis of religious creed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of stabbing his prison cell-mate. Defendant claimed that he acted in self-defense, because his cell-mate was HIV positive and was making sexual advances toward defendant. At trial, defendant called the victim to the stand and asked the victim about his two second degree sex offenses. The victim claimed he could not remember the details of the offenses. The trial court refused to allow defendant to use the PSI to refresh the victim's recollection, because it was confidential. The appellate court reversed. The requirement that a PSI remain confidential was in order to prevent public inspection. Because defendant intended to show it only to the subject for whom it was prepared, the confidentiality of the PSI was not at risk. The trial court's failure to allow defendant to utilize the PSI to refresh the victim's recollection was reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was arrested and charged with the criminal offense of possession of a controlled dangerous substance. Respondent suspended petitioner and ultimately dismissed petitioner from his job. The dismissal was reviewed by three different administrative law judges (ALJ). Petitioner contended his termination was based improperly on the records of his arrest and prosecution that had been expunged according to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 737. The trial court affirmed petitioner's termination as appropriate because it was founded on the police officers' testimony, based on their personal recollections, and not on expunged records. Upon certiorari review, the supreme court determined that an ALJ did not abuse her discretion when she concluded the officers testified from their independent recollection and that such conclusion was supported by substantial evidence on the record. In addition, the supreme court found the appellate court was correct in determining the issue regarding petitioner's viewing of another ALJ's personnel file was moot because petitioner effectively was afforded the relief to which he might have been entitled had recusal been found to be appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that defense counsel's error in the case was not the type in which prejudice would be presumed. Further, the appellate court found that petitioner had not satisfied the prejudice prong of the Strickland analysis. Finally, trial counsel's failure to inform petitioner of his right to automatic removal, without more, did not necessarily render the criminal trial fundamentally unfair or unreliable.

Ann. Code &sect;&sect; 27, 464B(a)(5), (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol.), statutory rape involving a 14-year-old or 15-year-old, arguing that he should have been allowed to raise a reasonable mistake of age defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had good reason to believe the young woman he lived with was 17 years-old, but she was actually 15. Because he was over 21, he was prosecuted for third-degree sexual assault in violation of Md. Ann. Code &sect; 464B(a)(5), the statutory rape offense applicable to contact between an adult and a 14- or 15-year-old. He argued that he should have been allowed to raise a defense of reasonable mistake of age. The court used the same reasoning it had used earlier to find the defense unavailable in a prosecution for second-degree sexual assault, sexual contact between younger children and persons four years or more their senior. The legislative history showed that the prohibitions had been drafted specifically to preclude that defense, or was there a violation of due process or right of privacy, the later was often trumped by the state's compelling interest in child welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Legislative history clarified that legislators did not intend defense to be available. There was no due process or privacy right violation given the state's compelling interest in child welfare and that it would only reach conduct involving someone almost 16 if the defendant were 21.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought certiorari review of Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmance of his drug and paraphernalia possession offense and conspiracy convictions, arguing insufficiency of evidence to show knowledge that drugs were present and failure to excuse certain jurors for cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was a passenger in a car stopped by police officers. An eventual search of the vehicle led to discovery of a large amount of cocaine and drug paraphernalia in a sealed box in the trunk. The court held that petitioner's presence in the car, without more, was insufficient evidence as a matter of law to support his convictions of drug and paraphernalia possession, drug possession with intent to distribute, and conspiracy. Knowledge was an essential element of all these offenses, not knowledge that drug possession was wrong, which was presumed, but actual knowledge that the drugs were present. Under the circumstances of petitioner's behavior during the stop, together with the manner in which the contraband was hidden, it was not possible for a rational fact-finder to have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner failed to preserve alleged jury selection error, but the court reversed his convictions because the circumstantial evidence that petitioner, a passenger, had any knowledge of contraband in a sealed container in the trunk was inadequate as a matter of law to support his conviction.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court (Maryland) affirmed the decision. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari challenging the decision, which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was the owner of record of a convenience store. Respondent filed a complaint for abatement of nuisance pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 14-120, alleging the property was used for the purpose of illegally distributing, storing, and administering controlled dangerous substances. The complaint stated that drug users frequently gathered at the store for the purpose of purchasing and using drugs. The trial court ordered that the property be destroyed. The court held that a district court's authority under Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 14-120 did not extend to the destruction of a building which was used for unlawful activity. The court found the unlawful activity at which the statute was aimed did not inhere in a building itself. Instead, it was entirely in the use of the building. The court held that authority to order the destruction of property did not extend to the situation. The court further held that construing Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 14-120 as allowing for destruction of property without any compensation to the owner raised serious questions concerning the statute's constitutionality under Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 40 and Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the decision, because destruction of property was not an available remedy where the property was only used for an unlawful activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a prisoner in appellant correctional facility, filed a petition for habeas corpus, challenging appellant's interpretation of her sentence. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) granted the petition and held that appellee's terms for multiple counts of felony theft were concurrent rather than consecutive. Appellant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was convicted of nine counts of felony theft and one count of conspiracy. Appellee filed a petition for habeas corpus, contending that appellant correctional facility was required to follow the sentencing court's oral pronouncement of sentence, which conflicted with the written order. The circuit court determined that the state department of corrections had failed to abide by its own procedures for clarification of ambiguous commitments and that it was required to follow the oral pronouncement. As a result, according to the circuit court, appellee's term consisted of 10 concurrent sentences of three years each. The court, holding first that habeas corpus was the appropriate method for appellee to raise the issue, and appellant had the right to appeal the circuit court's decision. The court then held that the circuit court misconstrued appellee's sentence. The intention of the sentencing judge to impose a 24-year sentence was clear. Consequently, there could be no illegal modification of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed. Habeas corpus was the appropriate way for appellee to raise the issue of her alleged right to be released from custody, and appellant had the right to appeal the circuit court decision. Appellee's sentence was not ambiguous, and the habeas corpus court erred in modifying the sentence from the 24 years the trial court imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination of the applicability of Md. Ann. Code art. 29, &sect; 3-107(a) (1957 &amp; 1997) to an impending condemnation action by appellee. Appellant's action was filed before condemnation proceedings had begun. The court, sua sponte, raised the issue of whether the case was appropriate for declaratory judgment. The Maryland law did not authorize appellant's declaratory judgment action. A condemnation action could only be initiated by appellee, not by appellant landowner. Appellee had the authority to abandon the action up until the actual taking of the property or 120 days after entry of judgment. Allowing appellant to maintain the declaratory judgment action before a condemnation action was filed, could not be reconciled with the proper role of appellee and appellant with regard to the power of eminent domain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment on the ground that Maryland law did not authorize a declaratory judgment action by appellant landowner, when appellee had not yet instituted a condemnation action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought certiorari to have the court review judgment of Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) which affirmed jury verdict in favor of respondent police officer on petitioner's claims of battery, gross negligence, and violation of rights under Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 26. The court granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, after breaking into a vacant apartment, hid in a closet to avoid police detection. When the police opened the closet, petitioner was shot by respondent officer who mistook a vacuum cleaner hose for a weapon. The trial court properly excluded evidence of police regulations, guidelines, and training procedures pertaining to the use of deadly force, as well as testimony of a superior officer regarding the propriety of respondent's entrance into the apartment. The only relevant information for the jury's consideration was the circumstances at the immediate time of the shooting. The propriety of prior decisions of respondent, that could not have been changed at that point, were not relevant. None of the actions pleaded, and none that were submitted to the jury, were based on violations of orders, regulations, or guidelines. Respondent clearly had a right to be in the apartment, and had a right to search it. The law could not reasonably put respondent in a position, at the split-second of the shooting, of being faced with the impossible choice of either defending himself, or putting his life in immediate mortal danger in order to save his pocketbook.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Jury was only entitled to consider circumstances of police shooting as seen by reasonable police officer at time of shooting, rather than to view circumstances with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight. Batson challenge was untimely since it was raised after jury was impaneled and sworn.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought writ of certiorari challenging a judgment of the Maryland Court of Special Appeals holding that the decision to classify petitioner as financially dependent on his non-resident parents for purposes of determining his residency status for payment of tuition was not arbitrary and capricious, illegal, or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was born and raised most of his life in Maryland. He lived year-round while attending the university, was a registered Maryland voter, was employed part-time, paid income taxes to the State of Maryland, and he had a Maryland driver's license. His application for in-state tuition payment status was denied. He was classified as a financially dependent student, and because his parents lived out-of-state he was deemed a nonresident. After graduating he sought a refund of the difference between in-state and out of state tuition. The court held the tuition policy of the Maryland Board of Regents and the board's absolute preclusion of in-state tuition status for any student whose primary monetary support came from an out-of-state source arbitrarily and irrationally discriminated against many bona fide Maryland residents in violation of the equal protection component of Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 24. The policy placed in one class bona fide Maryland residents whose primary source of funds was within the state, and placed in another, higher paying class bona fide Maryland residents whose primary source of funds was outside the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed. Policy of denying in-state tuition status to Maryland residents who received support from non-residents created an arbitrary and irrational classification which violated equal protection principles. The petitioner was entitled to have his residency classification determined by the university based on the eight &quot;domicile&quot; criteria without using the &quot;financial dependence&quot; and &quot;financial independence&quot; factors.</SPAN></P>

The court held that petitioner's failure to give notice until soon after his acquittal made his false arrest and imprisonment claims untimely, since these became legal injuries as soon as he was released from custody. However, the malicious prosecution claim did not accrue until petitioner was acquitted, so petitioner's notice was timely. Petitioner argued that untimely notice should have been waived for good cause, because he had been preoccupied with his criminal defense. After looking to other jurisdictions' decisions, the court held that, since giving of notice was not a complicated task, petitioner failed to show good cause for delay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed dismissal of false arrest and false imprisonment claims, because they accrued when petitioner was released, but reversed and remanded for further proceedings on malicious prosecution claim, because it did not accrue until petitioner's acquittal. Preparation of criminal defense was insufficient grounds for waiver of time limits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court issued writ of certiorari to appellants on its own initiative, from Circuit Court for Talbot County (Maryland) judgment for appellees, to consider whether Title II of Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12132, applied to administration and enforcement of county zoning ordinance governing variances for property within specified critical shoreline area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners purchased an unimproved shoreline acreage to which they made substantial improvements, including pathways to accommodate their disabled daughter's wheelchair. The pathways were installed without county building permits and portions were within a buffer zone of a critical environmental area. Upon discovering this, appellants sought a variance from the county board of appeals, which was granted. Appellee, the area's commission, sought judicial review. Appellants relied on Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12132. The circuit court reversed, holding the ADA did not apply and appellants did not meet the variance requirements of the relevant zoning ordinance. The court issued its own writ of certiorari to address the ADA issue. Meanwhile the ordinance was changed to require compliance with disability laws. The court therefore reversed on different grounds, reinstating the board decision, holding the board rightly recognized the need to reasonably accommodate disabled persons despite and within zoning restrictions and applied the appropriate criteria; substantial evidence supported its decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was reversed on different ground and case was remanded with directions to affirm county board of appeals' decision for appellants, as there was no basis to reverse board decision, given substantial evidence before board and its application of appropriate variance criteria to that evidence, both accommodating disabled homeowner's needs and satisfying requirements of zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

After in camera review, the trial court ordered defendants to comply and they appealed. The appellate court stayed the trial judgment and the court issued a writ of certiorari and vacated and remanded. The Act established a general presumption in favor of disclosure. Although content of calls may have been private, phone bills for official calls were not. The factual records sought were not generally subject to executive privilege, or were they personnel records, confidential commercial information, or interagency memos.

The jury sentenced appellant to death based on its apparently unanimous finding of the aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed while appellant was committing a robbery.

The appellate court affirmed the sentence for the robbery, holding that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in finding an adequate factual basis to support the guilty plea to robbery, including appellant's specific intent to rob the victim. However, the appellate court vacated the death sentence because the evidence, which clearly indicated that the robbery was committed as an afterthought to murder, was insufficient to establish the sole statutory aggravator justifying imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction by the Circuit Court for Howard County (Maryland) of constructive criminal contempt for failure to pay child support after that charge had been referred by the circuit court to a master pursuant to Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was delinquent in the payment of child support. The State prosecuted defendant for constructive criminal contempt. The circuit court referred the prosecution for determination by a master pursuant to Md. R. Family Law Actions 9-207(a)(1)(G). The circuit court, relying upon findings of the master, entered judgment convicting defendant. The court reversed that judgment holding that the circuit court had no authority under Md. R. Family Law Actions 9-207(a)(1)(G) or otherwise to refer the constructive criminal contempt prosecution to a master. A constructive criminal contempt prosecution, unlike a constructive civil contempt proceeding, was not to be included in any action in which the alleged contempt occurred, but was to be docketed as a separate criminal action, and carried out by a judge. Whether or not constitutionally mandated, as a matter of sound judicial policy, incarceration was to be ordered only by a judge on a record developed before the judge. In a criminal contempt prosecution additional criminal safeguards of a criminal procedure were to be available to the accused, including the panoply of fundamental due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petition for writ of certiorari, filed by petitioner mutual fund shareholders, was granted to review a finding in favor of respondent state, that a statute did not violate the one-subject requirement of Md. Const. Art. III, &sect; 29. Part of the statute had been defeated as a bill, and was engrafted onto another bill which had been unanimously approved. The approved bill's sponsor voted against the engrafted version. The approved bill served to protect individuals from being appointed resident agents without their written consent. The engrafted version additionally provided that directors of certain investment companies would be deemed independent and disinterested. Protecting individuals from being appointed as resident agents without their written consent was not germane to protecting investment company directors' decisions from shareholders' derivative suits. Combining these separate and unrelated provisions into one Act was unconstitutional. The directors' liability provisions were invalid and severed from the resident agent provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After discovering that two of his three children were fathered by his wife's art professor, respondent husband filed for divorce, and sought damages for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress resulting from petitioner wife's alleged adultery and misrepresentation of the paternity of the children. The trial court dismissed the tort counts, holding that those causes of action were barred by interspousal immunity and by public policy. The intermediate court reversed. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that respondent's tort claims were not viable. Respondent sought to recover damages, under different tort labels, for the same type of conduct that formerly gave rise to the common law cause of action known as &quot;criminal conversation.&quot; That action was abolished on constitutional and public policy grounds years before. The identical public policy considerations were applicable here. Allowing respondent's actions would simply be reviving the tort of criminal conversation through artful pleading.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After trial on the controversy, the trial court issued a declaratory judgment precluding the placement of the proposed charter amendment on the general election ballot. The appellate court affirmed the lower court's ruling by finding that the proposed amendment was essentially legislative in character and in all respects similar to the enactment of a local law. As such, it was an improper attempt to divest the county government of its power to legislate. While charters commonly authorized or precluded specified types of enactments by legislative bodies, they did not properly contain all provisions concerning the subject. The proposed speed bump amendment would narrowly have mandated that the county council could not authorize new speed bumps, and that it must remove all in existence. Thus, the proposed amendment left virtually no room for the exercise of discretion by the county council.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-706(a) (2014) did not violate Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 17 because the added burdens brought about by the 2009 or 2010 amendments to the Maryland Sex Offender Registration Act did not constitute punishment.</SPAN></P>

IV, as fell within Justice Kennedy's McNeely concurrence and it helped law enforcement identify a category of cases in which it was reasonable to dispense with the warrant requirement; [2]-Section 16-205.1(c) required a motor vehicle accident that had caused death or a life threatening injury. As the attention of law enforcement would be divided between critical tasks, it was proper to assign a lower priority to obtaining a warrant before the evidence metabolized; [3]-Section 16-205.1(c) required that law enforcement have an articulable suspicion that the defendant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol; [4]-As the three conditions of &sect; 16-205.1(c) applied, defendant was properly required to submit to a breath test without a warrant.</SPAN></P>
