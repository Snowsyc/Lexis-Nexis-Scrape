</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner applied to build an Adult Retirement Community Planned Unit Development (ARCPUD) pursuant to a town zoning bylaw. The application sought a necessary special permit. Nothing in the zoning bylaw expressly authorized the Board to assess mitigation fees. The Board at a public hearing asked the homebuilder to make a mitigation payment toward the expansion of the town's senior center. The homebuilder initially ignored the request, later said it was &quot;o.k.&quot; with it, and finally indicated it did not agree to do so. In the Board's final decision, it did not mention the mitigation payment requirement in certain final decision sections. The Board then approved the permit request. The only reference to mitigation occurred after the end of the waiver section. The homebuilder objected to the mitigation payment requirement. The trial court found that the Board's decision to approve the special permit application with the mitigation payment requirement had to be vacated, as the Board was not authorized under the town's zoning bylaws to make that request and even though the homebuilder appeared to agree to it, the homebuilder still objected to it while the matter was at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Commonwealth sued defendant mortgagees alleging that through their issuance of subprime loans, they violated Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &sect; 1 et seq. and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &sect; 4(3B). It also alleged defendant corporate parents and grandparents participated in the alleged wrongdoing, and made defendant acquiring company a party. The Commonwealth's motion for preliminary injunctive relief was opposed by separate motions to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth, through its attorney general, filed an action seeking a preliminary injunction against subprime lending activities it claimed violated laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &sect; 1 et seq., and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &sect; 4(3B) by discriminating against black and Latino borrowers. The Commonwealth directed the action against the mortgagees, the corporate parents and grandparents, and an acquiring company who eventually purchased the allegedly troublesome mortgages. The various defendants sought dismissal. The trial court found that the Commonwealth was entitled to the preliminary injunction. It also found that (1) the Commonwealth had sufficiently sought relief by alleging that the mortgages were unfair pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &sect; 2 because a combination of their features made repayment of the underlying loans very risky; (2) that the discrimination claim was pled with sufficient specificity; (3) that additional investigation of personal jurisdiction over the corporate parents and grandparents was required, and (4) the acquiring company had to stay in the case solely for granting any necessary equitable relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied both the mortgagees' motions to dismiss and compel arbitration, reserved ruling on the corporate parent and grandparent's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, allowed the acquiring company's motion to dismiss regarding not having to pay penalties or costs, but denied it regarding equitable relief that could be awarded against it, and granted the Commonwealth's preliminary injunction as indicated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner filed a Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 249, &sect; 4 action on remand seeking review of an order of conditions issued by defendant Brewster Conservation Commission, which denied the owner's application to construct a single-family dwelling and septic system within a buffer zone around an isolated land subject to flooding surrounded by isolated vegetative wetland. The parties filed cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the finding that alternative access to the lot was feasible was not supported by substantial evidence. The Commission found a possible alternative access, but not a feasible alternative access. In order to effect the Commission's possible alternative access to the lot, the owner would have to reconfigure an adjacent lot, at a cost of approximately $ 30,000, which was an objectively great expense. Requiring such expense of the owner, in addition to his effort and energy, bordered on waste. The Commission did not give due consideration to the relative costs of alternative access and the impact that alternative access would impose upon the adjacent lot. There was support for the Commission's policy of imposing upon an applicant a 2:1 mitigation ratio. Even though the policy was unwritten, the Commission had imposed this ratio upon applicants before. The policy was not arbitrary and capricious. As Brewster, Mass., Wetlands Regs. &sect; 5:01 required the owner seeking a variance to satisfy all the enumerated requirements, the Commission's findings of inadequate mitigation to the adverse impact of the project supported its denial of the owner's application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's motion for judgment on the pleadings was denied. The Commission's cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings was allowed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff rental unit owners sought a preliminary injunction to prohibit defendant town from enforcing the provisions of Article 37 of the Town of Milford, Mass., bylaw on the ground that it violated their equal protection rights, that the fees under the Article constituted a tax, that the Article violated their Fourth Amendment rights, and that their due process rights were violated. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Article 37 required properties that were leased, rented, or offered for lease or rent to be registered with the board of health and obtain a certificate of registration. The superior court held that the bylaw was rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of public safety. Because the Article limited an owner's use of land without discriminating or burdening fundamental rights, it was valid as long as it served a rational, public purpose. The passing of a bylaw affecting rental units in response to observations by board of public health employees of dangerous and unhealthy conditions in rental units was rationally related to the legitimate government interest of protecting public health. Article 37 did not constitute an illegal tax. Paying the fee did not confer a benefit. Property owners could choose to no longer rent out their property and thus avoid the licensing fees. There was no violation of the owners' rights under the Fourth Amendment and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 14. Because non-consenting unit owners had the ability to force the board of public health to acquire administrative search warrants, they were not coerced into consenting to searches.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court allowed the town's motion for summary judgment in part and denied it in part. It denied the owners' motion for summary judgment in all respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was an appeal from an enforcement order of defendant Barnstable Conservation Commission (BCC) (Massachusetts) wherein the BCC reaffirmed previous orders against plaintiff property owner's alleged prohibited activities in a buffer zone protected by the Wetlands Protection Act (WPA). Among other things, the BCC sought removal of a miniature golf course that was installed without the filing of a prior notice of intent or BCC approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 40, the court concluded that the property owner's continuation of activities within the protected wetlands area, except to the extent they were grandfathered or exempted by the WPA, would be enjoined unless a notice of intent had been filed by the property owner and the activity had been approved by the BCC. Regarding the property owner's installation of irrigation and lighting, to the extent that these had not been removed, the court ordered the property owner to remove them within 30 days. Regarding the property owner's cutting of grass and pruning of plants, the court found that aerial photographs which pre-dated his ownership of the property indicated that grass-cutting had been done for decades by previous owners so that a grandfathered use existed. In addition, there was no adverse impact. Also, pruning of vegetation, like grass-cutting, was not a prohibited activity and was exempt from the WPA. Finally, regarding the installation of the miniature golf course, while there was no adverse impact, the installation was subject to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 40 and 310 Mass. Code Regs. 10.02, which required the filing of a notice of intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner was ordered to remove any items which he installed and to file a notice of intent as to the golf course. Except for continuation of activities determined to be non-violative of the WPA, the property owner was to cease and desist from engaging in activities in the buffer zones without filing a notice of intent and obtaining BCC approval. The BCC counterclaim seeking enforcement of its orders in all other respects was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, charged with five counts of rape of a child, three counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, six counts of posing or exhibiting a child in a state of nudity, and one count of administering a drug in order to have sexual intercourse, moved to suppress DVD and mini-cassette evidence that a private individual turned over to police and which the police viewed in their entirety without a warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence was stolen from defendant's apartment during a break-in and later turned in to the police. He contended that he had a subjective expectation of privacy in the DVDs and mini-cassettes, as they were stored in a lockbox with other valuables. The appeals court found the DVDs and mini-cassettes contained no information indicating their ownership. Consequently, defendant's subjective expectation that the police or any other persons who discovered them would not view at least a portion of them to determine their owner was not one that society was prepared to recognize as reasonable. In addition, when the police watched each of the DVDs in their entirety, defendant's expectation of privacy in them had already been eroded. The police merely viewed the same people doing the same sorts of acts on the same DVDs that had already been viewed by private parties. The fact that the police took more time and were more thorough than the private parties did not result in a Fourth Amendment violation. Given that the DVDs and mini-cassettes were all similar recordable media equipment, the police could determine with substantial certainty that the mini-cassettes contained the same material.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was observed viewing nude pictures of a child on a library computer, and printing a photograph. An examination of the public computer revealed that he had used the computer for similar purposes. He had also checked on his status as a registered sex offender. A grand jury issued an indictment. Defendant first argued that the photo in issue was not lewd or lascivious. The photo could credibly be characterized as a candid shot of a preteen with breast buds playing on a nude beach. The mere visual depiction of a nude child is insufficient to support a charge of child pornography. However, the court deferred to the collective judgment of the grand jury found otherwise. The court would not substitute its view of the photo for that of the grand jury. The court also found that Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 272, &sect; 29C(vii), was not vague or overbroad. The common understanding of the term &quot;lewd&quot; and the decisional law of the Commonwealth construing that term adequately apprised a defendant that a photograph featuring the breast buds of a preteen girl could be deemed lewd and subject to criminal sanctions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' property abutted a lake, although they had no property interest in the lake, and they used the area around where their property was located for swimming. It was noted that the lake was used for boating, swimming, and fishing. Based on a petition by town residents, 2006 Mass. Acts 91 was enacted, which increased the speed limit for boating within the area of the lake around the owners' home. The law effectively limited the swimmable area by the owners' property. They filed their action with respect to 2006 Mass. Acts 91, and their initial request for a preliminary injunction was denied. Thereafter, defendants sought dismissal of the action. The court held that as the owners had no property interest in the lake, they could not bring a claim under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. There was also no violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as no fundamental right of the owners was affected and there was no suspect classification involved. There was no violation of the standing laws under Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 10, as any harm suffered by the owners was not special or peculiar.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties disputed whether the town charter allowed plaintiff to hold both positions. Plaintiff was sworn into office as a member of the town council. The court held that plaintiff had failed to show irreparable harm. Under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 43B, &sect; 7, the commission could proceed with fewer than nine members, and plaintiff could participate in its activities as a member of the public. Moreover, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 43B, &sect;&sect; 8(b) and 10 contemplated active participation in the commission by current town officials. The refusal to swear plaintiff in did not unconstitutionally impinge upon his right to be elected under Mass. Const. art. 9. This right was subject to legislation reasonably necessary to achieve legitimate public objectives. Simultaneously holding more than one office was a matter of public concern. Next, the public would not suffer irreparable harm if plaintiff was not immediately sworn into office, as he could participate in the commission as a town councilor and as a member of the public. Finally, plaintiff had failed to convince the court that he had a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. Both he and the town clerk had raised compelling arguments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127, 133D 1/2, required sex offenders on parole to wear a Global Positioning System (GPS) device at all times and to stay out of certain geographic zones the parole board has designated for them. Offenders on parole were also required to pay to maintain a telephone line dedicated to the use of the GPS and pay other fees. Among other alleged errors, the offenders argued that the statute was void for vagueness because the term &quot;court ordered parole supervision&quot; referred to a status that did not exist in Massachusetts. The court found that the offenders had not established a likelihood of success on the claim. An enactment was void for vagueness if its prohibitions were not clearly defined. The court held that application of common intelligence demonstrated that the challenged phrase was not so vague as to render Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127, &sect; 133D 1/2, void. An exercise of common intelligence indicated that the legislature's use of the phrase &quot;court ordered parole supervision&quot; intended to expand the application of the Mass. Gen.

The and suffered fatal injuries as a result of Ms. Rodriguez's negligence. The estate also sued the owner and lessor of the van under a agency theory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case against the van owner was based solely on the allegation that the driver was acting as the owner's agent at the time of the accident and that the van owner was therefore legally responsible for the driver's alleged negligence. The estate conceded that the only basis for that allegation of agency relationship was found in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 85A. The court held the evidence submitted by the van owner to negate the existence of agency relationship between it and the driver had to be weighted against the prima facie evidence created by the statute. That was a question of fact for a fact finder to decide. However, since the only basis for the van owner's possible liability to the estate was its ownership of the vehicle involved in the accident, and there was no evidence proffered to show that the driver was under the direction or control of the van owner at the time of the accident or at any other time, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106(a) was applicable to the circumstances and, as it preempted the application of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 85A, it required a summary judgment in favor of the van owner.</SPAN></P>

The landlords contended that they were entitled to indemnification from the cable television company pursuant to the provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 166A, &sect; 22. The trial court found that the Massachusetts Legislature had intended by the statute that cable television operators were to indemnify the cities and towns in which their operations existed. If the Legislature had intended that the operators of cable television system facilities were to have indemnified landlords in the way the landlords claimed, the Legislature would have stated just that intention, but instead did not. Furthermore, common sense and sound reason necessitated that the provision covered damage as a result of the installation or removal of cable television services, or damage caused by the operation of the cable television services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had previously granted plaintiffs summary judgment establishing defendant's liability under ch. 93A. The court noted that by cross-moving for summary judgment, defendant was effectively moving for reconsideration. The court, in exercising its discretion to review and undo the work of another judge up until the time of final judgment, changed the court's prior opinion finding that plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. The court held that plaintiffs' ch. 93A claim could not stand as a matter of law because the sales tax code and regulation covering the field precluded such an action. The court held that the sales tax code provided no express remedy for purchasers, such as plaintiffs, to recover for overcharged taxes. Further, nothing in the language of the sales tax code revealed an intention to allow for the recovery of minimum statutory damages or multiple monetary damages as would be available under ch. 93A.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 149, &sect; 152A, the Massachusetts Tips Statute. Both parties filed motions for partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before October 2002, defendants included a service charge on food and beverage bills for banquets. Part of the service charge was distributed to managers or retained by defendants, which argued that this was proper because managers sometimes assisted in serving food. The court first noted that plaintiffs' claims, which were filed in October 2002, fell under the version of &sect; 152A in effect prior to its 2004 amendment. The court then declined to find the pre-2004 statute unconstitutionally vague for failure to define &quot;employees&quot; and &quot;service&quot; in the second sentence. The terms had to be interpreted in conjunction with the entire section, not just the sentence in which they appeared. Next, the court held that distributing service charges based on an employee's primary duty was consistent with legislative intent. Thus, the issue was not whether managers assisted in serving food or how often, but what their primary duty was during banquets. The primary duty of the managers was to supervise, not to serve food and beverages to patrons. Accordingly, plaintiffs were entitled to the full benefit of the service charges.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also made other statements directly to police. In support his motion to suppress the statement made to medical personnel, defendant argued that when he made the statement he was still under the influence of pain medication and thus, the statement was involuntary. The court noted that defendant's diminished capacity due to the trauma and surgery did not require a finding that his statement was involuntary. There was no police misconduct and the &quot;interrogations&quot; were calm, conversational, and very short. Defendant's statements to police were also found to be admissible because, inter alia, his responses were not illogical or nonsensical. Nor the failure to tape record an officer reading defendant his rights invalidate defendant's statement to police.

The pre-2004 amendment version of &sect; 152A was not unconstitutionally vague for failure to define the term.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff representatives filed a class action complaint against defendants, the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MTA) and the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), challenging the constitutionality, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, of a toll discount program. The MTA and the Massport filed motions to dismiss under Mass. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The representatives alleged that the MTA and Massport violated the constitutional rights of the representatives, and the class they purported to represent, by implementing and enforcing a discount toll program regarding vehicular transit in tunnels and over a bridge in and around Boston, Massachusetts. The program was implemented to reduce environmental pollution and alleviate traffic congestion in nearby communities. The court found that the program's burden on interstate travel was minimal and it did not involve a fundamental interest. Therefore, because the program furthered compelling interests, the program did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. Moreover, granting a slight travel privilege to the communities most affected by the tunnels and the bridge closely related to the sought after objectives did not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of U.S. Const. art.

Gen. Laws ch. 66, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group's efforts to obtain certain public records stemmed from an effort to challenge, and perhaps bring to a halt, the construction of a Mosque and cultural center on a parcel of land owned by an Islamic group. The authority refused to turn over all of the documents requested, claiming that the group did not have standing to make the request because the initial request letters were written by an individual. The court permitted the group, within 10 business days, to join the individual as a party plaintiff pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 17(a). The authority also challenged the contents of the request, which the court found read more like the opening salvo in the quest for documents pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 34. The court urged the requester to consider redrafting a much leaner, more directly focused and reasonable request that either properly could be responded to or that could produce a revised good faith estimate of the costs involved in collecting, examining, and producing whatever could be requested. The court also urged the prompt turnover of those records that the authority had yet to turn over to the requester, on payment of proper copying charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect; 24 1/2, which took effect in 2006, drivers with two or more operating under the influence (OUI) convictions were required to install a Certified Ignition Interlock Device (IID) on their vehicles. Plaintiff, who had been convicted of OUI in 1990 and 1994, refused to install the device. The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that Mass Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24 1/2 was an ex post facto law in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24. The statute's dominant purpose was to protect public safety; thus, it was remedial. The fact that the IID requirement imposed a heavy burden upon individuals such as plaintiff did not render it punitive. Next, the court rejected plaintiff's argument that because he had operated a motor vehicle safely for 11 years, the IID requirement violated his due process rights. The statute bore a reasonable relation to the legislature's goal of ensuring that those who had flouted the law in the past did not threaten future injury to themselves or to others. The legislature had determined that the IID requirement applied to all individuals with two or more OUI convictions. Any changes would have to be made by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident filed a declaratory action pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231A to declare that the Boston Redevelopment Authority's (BRA) sale of urban renewal land to the ISB violated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and the Massachusetts Anti-Aid Amendment. The resident alleged that the sale was substantially below market value, constituted an illegal and unconstitutional subsidy of a specific Islamic sect, and an unconstitutional entanglement and integration between a governmental institution of higher learning and the same Islamic sect. The court found that the resident filed his action more than 16 months after the challenged sale and more than 15 months after the applicable 30-day statute of limitations had run. Consequently, because the resident's challenge was time-barred by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 121A, the ISB was entitled to a judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(c) and Mass. Super. Ct.

Plaintiff brought suit after defendants instigated criminal proceedings against plaintiff after plaintiff was hired to install new air conditioning units for the town administration building.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Within a short period of time, the alleged new system failed. In conducting somewhat of an investigation, the various individual defendants believed that plaintiff falsely presented that he had installed new units but, instead, had never installed anything new. One of the sergeants conducted a show cause hearing against plaintiff, the clerk magistrate issued a complaint on the charge of larceny by false pretenses, but the complaint was dismissed upon plaintiff's motion. Plaintiff was never arrested, placed in custody, or handcuffed at any time during the proceedings. The court denied defendants' motion to dismiss, which was based on the anti-SLAPP statute,&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 59H, since defendants were all government employees engaged in conduct in their capacities as government employees. Since defendants were not engaged in petitioning activity, they failed to meet their initial burden of proof to have the anti-SLAPP statute apply. The court found merit in some, but not all additional claims against the various defendants and set forth its decision on each claim as to summary judgment, depending on whether the respective parties were immune to suit or not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendants' motion to dismiss.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners sought judicial review of a denial of a variance by defendant Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation under the Watershed Management Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 92A1/2. They argued that the Act violated Mass. Const. art. X and Mass. Const. amend. art. XLIX. The Department filed a motion to dismiss based on res judicata. The landowners filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that res judicata did not apply. In a previous action, the landowners had argued that under Mass. Const. amend. art. XLIX, the Commonwealth had the duty to acquire a property interest in land in order to enact regulations restricting the use of their property. They were not making such a claim here. As for the taking claim, the court would hear it, as the landowners had gone through the variance procedure in order to ripen it. Next, the court held that the Act did not violate Mass. Const. art. X. The landowners were claiming that the denial of the variance deprived them of all economically beneficial use of part of their property. Reasonable government action that restricted an owner's use of a portion of the land, and that did not involve a physical invasion or a &quot;categorical&quot; or &quot;total&quot; regulatory taking, did not require a payment of compensation. As for the Mass. Const. amend. art. XLIX claim, the Department had not acquired an interest in the landowners' property in the nature of an easement. Neither the Act nor the variance decision deprived the landowners of the exclusive use of part of their property or granted the Department a right of use or enjoyment of it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter before the court was whether same-sex marriage was prohibited in New York and Rhode Island. The court determined that same-sex marriage was prohibited in New York based on a decision of the New York Court of Appeals, which held that New York's Domestic Relations Law's limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples was not unconstitutional. The court applied the chief justice's construction of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 207, &sect;&sect; 11 and 12, to determine whether same-sex marriage was prohibited in Rhode Island. Accordingly, the court would find same-sex marriage was prohibited in Rhode Island if same-sex marriage was explicitly deemed void or otherwise expressly forbidden by a Rhode Island constitutional amendment, by a Rhode Island statute, or by a Rhode Island Supreme Court decision. However, the court determined that same-sex marriage was not prohibited in Rhode Island. No evidence was introduced of a constitutional amendment, statute, or controlling appellate decision from Rhode Island that explicitly deemed void or otherwise expressly forbade same-sex marriage.</SPAN></P>

Acts 91, which increased the speed limit for motorboats within a channel on a particular lake.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners argued that the statute was an unconstitutional taking of their property rights. The trial court held that the statute did not affect any fundamental rights of the owners, was not based on a suspect classification, and had a strong presumption of validity. It displaced swimmers from most of the open water within the channel and permitted motorboats to operate up to 35 m.p.h. It was rational for the Massachusetts legislature to decide that boat traffic should be preferred over swimming. Moreover, the authority of the Division of Law Enforcement to establish speed limits for motorboats on lakes could be amended by the legislature. Any impact on the recreational, aesthetic, or property interests of the owners was de minimus. There was no regulatory taking. Further, the owners lacked standing. The law provided that in the event of a conflict with the regulations, the state statute controlled. The statute protected swimmers by prohibiting swimming in the channel. Finally, the statute did not permit the negligent operation of a motorboat. The safe operation of motorboats was required by state law and the social norms that constituted the standard of care for motorboats.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was a member of the Massachusetts bar. She was a respondent in several complaints before the Board. The attorney alleged that these complaints were filed against her because the attorney unsuccessfully ran for governor on a platform of court reform and the abolishment of judicial and quasi-judicial immunities. Bar Counsel and Assistant Bar Counsel were immune from liability under Mass. Sup. Jud. Ct. R. 4:01, &sect; 9(3). Mass. Sup. Jud. Ct. R. 4:01, &sect; 9(3) provided no qualification on the immunity conferred, save only that the challenged conduct must have been committed in the course of their official duties. The complaint did not allege that the Bar Counsel or Assistant Bar Counsel acted outside the scope of their official duties. Likewise, the Office and Board were immune from liability under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258, &sect; 10(c), which provided an exception to liability under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258, for claims arising out of an intentional tort. The actions at issue fell squarely within Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258, &sect; 10(c).</SPAN></P>

The non-media defendants filed a special motion to dismiss under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect;&nbsp;59H contending that their actions were &quot;petitioning activity&quot; within the meaning of that statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiffs alleged that a project they undertook to build a mosque came to a halt because of a very public attack mounted by both the media and non-media defendants on it and its members. After a review of the record evidence, the court found that the non-media defendants failed to meet their burden of showing that the subject matter of the plaintiffs' claims was based solely on the defendants' &quot;petitioning activity,&quot; as that term was defined by the case law. While the court agreed with the non-media defendants that whether conduct was &quot;petitioning activity&quot; did not turn on whether their efforts in obtaining government review were successful, the problem with this position was that their complaints were not of the sort capable of being reviewed by any governmental agency. The complaint also asserted that the plaintiffs were targeted because they were Muslim, in violation of their civil rights. To prevent them from pursuing relief without a more compelling showing on the part of the defendants that they were being sued solely because of their petitioning activity, would come dangerously close to applying Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &sect; 59H in an unconstitutional manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a change of plea and sentencing, defendant was given concurrent sentences of straight probation for 15 years with probation supervision, including specified conditions that included restitution of over $117,000 dollars and house arrest under electronic monitoring. A trial judge then decided that mistakes had been made, and a new sentencing order was entered after consideration of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 92, and other relevant statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had stolen from her employer and had stolen funds meant for the poor. A cosmetologist, she was also a single mother with three children, one of whom was ill. In part, the court in its new sentencing order stated that the process by which the prior sentence had been imposed was flawed, that defendant should have been expressly directed to stay under house arrest until the electronic monitoring was installed, and that a complete financial inventory of defendant's property should have been done before setting the terms of repayment. In so ruling, the judge discussed the aims of sentencing and restitution, including deterrence and the social policies behind it, and relied on Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 92A, by analogy, and on 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3664(d)(2)(B)(3), for guidance in arriving at a &quot;just punishment&quot; in view of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211E, &sect; 2(3), explaining that restitution was a just punishment. The judge also stated that the decision to reject the recommendation of incarceration was appropriate in the instant case and explained that the Probation Department established a payment plan in a case like the instant one in which the amount of restitution was not in dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court imposed probation with strict conditions, including electronically monitored house arrest for a year, monthly restitution payments for 15 years, and drug test monitoring. The court also ordered that if defendant failed to comply with the conditions or violated any law, she was subject to imprisonment up to the maximum sentence allowed. She was also ordered to obtain a job and support her children. The court also issued related orders.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 13B on the grounds that he was not accused of touching the alleged victim and alternatively, that &sect; 13B was unconstitutionally vague if it extended to cases where a defendant directed another to touch himself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Witnesses told a grand jury that on various occasions over a three-year period, defendant instructed his stepson, then between 11 and 14 years old, to masturbate while defendant watched. The court granted his motion to dismiss the indictment because there was no evidence that he committed the required indecent touching of a child. While there was no dispute regarding the sexual nature or intimacy of defendant's conduct, the element of touching required under &sect; 13B did not include touching of the victim's person by the victim's own hand at defendant's direction or command. Caselaw defining touching under &sect; 13B focused either on a defendant's actual, physical touching of a victim or on a defendant's direction to a victim that the victim indecently touch another person. No case made the conduct of directing a victim to touch him or herself a crime under &sect; 13B. Even if &sect; 13B did include such conduct, the dismissal of the indictment would have been required because such an expansion would have made &sect; 13B overbroad and failed to provide fair notice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission, a public agency, helped businesses with a smooth transition to a new location. It was determined that the corporation had to move its business; the land was needed for a regional development project. The Department determined that the corporation, which had decided to close rather than to relocate, was entitled to over $ 1 million. At the administrative hearing, evidence was introduced of the various costs to the corporation and the value of its assets. A hearing officer used the fair market value of equipment and calculated a number of other figures to reach the dollar amount. The Commission argued that the corporation was entitled to a lesser figure because it was closing, not relocating. On review, the court, noting its normal deference to an agency's findings and its role under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 30A, &sect; 14, to make the findings of fact, agreed that the corporation fell under the definition of a business forced to move from its real property and that the corporation's direct losses of tangible personal property had to be calculated just as if it had relocated. The court deferred to the officer's refusal of interests and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motions for judgment on the pleadings and affirmed the decision of the Department, with a modification based on a mathematical error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driveway would have been built within an area designated as resource area buffer to the salt marsh. The court affirmed. The Commission's ruling that the owner had failed to meet two prongs of the four-part criteria for a variance established in Falmouth, Mass., Wetlands Regs. &sect; 10:13 was within its discretion and was supported by substantial evidence. The Commission's decision discussed the negative impacts the construction would have on the viability of the salt marsh, noting the developmental impacts that would occur in decreasing plant species diversity within the salt marsh, a concern related to the owner's proposed work within 25 feet of the salt marsh. The Commission identified the values of the salt marsh and how developmental impacts could be expected to prejudice the resource area. Further, even assuming the owner established a hardship, he failed to establish an unconstitutional taking from enforcement of Falmouth, Mass., Wetlands Regs. &sect; 10:18(7), which prohibited work within 25 feet of a salt marsh, because he failed to show that enforcement of &sect; 10:18(7) would eliminate all economically beneficial use of the locus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owners were awarded a judgment of the difference between the jury's finding of the fair market value of a property taken in an eminent domain proceeding and the pro tanto amount, plus interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners argued that the interest rate, which stood at an effective annual rate of 2.18 percent, failed to meet the standard of constitutional reasonableness. The trial court held that it was not clear that a challenge to the prejudgment interest awarded in an eminent domain case could be raised in a post-judgment motion. However, even if the challenge was procedurally proper, it failed as a matter of substantive law. The owners' expert testified that a return of between 4.81 percent and 5.84 percent was expected during the period. The market-sensitive rate in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 79, &sect; 37 was constitutionally reasonable. A &quot;reasonable&quot; interest rate for constitutional purposes did not represent one precise rate, but rather a range of figures. The disparity of between 2.63 percent and 3.66 percent between the rate reached by application of the statute with its built-in recourse to a non-fixed market-driven index and that alluded to by the owners' expert was not sufficient to require allowance of the owners' motion.</SPAN></P>

The police did not ask the third party whether he was an occupant or lessee and had no information as to whether he regularly stayed in the apartment, had keys to it, or otherwise exercised any control over it. The police were aware that there were other individuals present and it was as likely that the third party was a visitor as that he was a person with joint access or control over the apartment. The community caretaking function was inapplicable as the police were engaged in a criminal investigation when they entered the premises. Further, the search warrant affidavit did not indicate that the police believed that they were engaged in a caretaking function when they entered the premises.

At the institution, she was subjected to a visual strip search and visual body cavity search performed in privacy by a female corrections officer. A urine sample of the arrestee was taken for a pregnancy test. She was then taken to the nurse's office, where the nurse performed a routine medical screening. The arrestee contended that a fecal specimen was collected and that a physical body cavity search was conducted. The court found that it could not said as a matter of law that the visual strip search did not violate the arrestee's rights under the Fourth Amendment. Further, the officers and the supervisor were not entitled to qualified immunity as they should have been on notice that the policy of strip searching every incoming inmate, regardless of suspicion, was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a citizen, brought an action pursuant to to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231A, seeking a declaratory judgment that a sale of urban renewal land by defendant, a city agency, to defendant, a religious society, violated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and the Massachusetts Anti-Aid Amendment. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the citizen failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because he lacked the requisite legal standing to maintain this action. The Establishment Clause and the Massachusetts Anti-Aid Amendment shared similar areas of concern. Both provisions essentially sought to permit the sponsorship of any particular religion by the government. Thus, essentially both constitutional provisions placed a duty on state actors within Massachusetts to act with a secular purpose and a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion. Treating the factual allegations in his complaint as true, the court held that the citizen had alleged sufficient facts to place him within the area of concern of the Establishment Clause and the Anti-Aid Amendment. As a resident taxpayer of the City of Boston, the citizen had the right to contest the sale of publicly owned land at a below-market price to a religious institution for the purposes of operating a house of worship and the endorsement of a particular religion and excessive entanglement created by the establishment of a particular lecture program at a public college.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Massachusetts had not submitted any state plan to assume responsibility for occupational safety or health standards.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Anti-SLAPP statute,&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 59H, authorized a party to move to dismiss claims against the party which were based on the party's exercise of its rights of petition under the U.S. and Massachusetts Constitutions. The question presented in this case was how to treat a counterclaim for malicious prosecution under the Anti-SLAPP statute. The court held that when an abuse of process claim was based solely on another party's claim for negligence on the theory that the negligence claim was actually brought to achieve an ulterior motive and not on the basis of independent conduct, even though the negligence claim was not entirely lacking in merit, the abuse of process counterclaim should survive a special motion to dismiss. In the present case, defendants maintained that the sole purpose of bringing the Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 59H, motion to dismiss was to prevent a defendant from conveying one or more of its units to a bona fide purchaser for value. The court held that because this was a case in which the counterclaim for abuse of process was of the variety that was based entirely on the initiation of process, the special motion to dismiss had to be denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the employee had been earlier approved for disability retirement, a later medical panel examination found that he was capable of returning to his former duties. The court found that there was a high probability that the board violated several provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect; 8 in its refusal to accept the employee as an active member of the retirement system or accept any deductions made on his behalf. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect; 8 was a specific provision of the state public employee retirement and pension statute which covered the procedures for reexamination of members retired for disability and the restoration of certain members to active service. The board did not have the power to reexamine or evaluate the retiree or discretion to refute a decision of the medical panel. The public had a legitimate and strong interest in an accurate and unambiguous accounting of the state retirement fund and enforcement of a statutory mandate that required retirement deductions actually be placed in the proper savings annuity fund. Furthermore, the commission had a strong likelihood of prevailing on the merits of its case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner owned waterfront property. He sought to construct a stairway to provide access from his house to the beach. The Commission denied the request based on four concerns: (1) the alternative of nearby community access stairs; (2) the destruction of vegetation and habitat; (3) possible erosion; and (4) the prior trimming of vegetation on the bank. It also based its denial on failure of the proposed work to meet the standards set forth in Eastham, Mass., Wetlands Protection By-law, art. 34 (1980). The court held that the Commission's findings regarding erosion and habitat were in direct contradiction to the evidence. It was clear that the common landing was considered as a technical alternative to the proposed project. In considering the common landing as a technical alternative the Commission ignored the direction of its own Bylaw. The common landing was not a technical alternative as required. The Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it considered the common landing as a technical alternative. As the Bylaw imposed stricter standards than the Wetlands Protection Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 40, the superseding order of condition did not control.</SPAN></P>

Second, the board held that the developer had created &quot;reserve strips&quot; along both of the plan's entrance roads, which were prohibited under the town's subdivision control regulations. The court ruled that the board's action was unconstitutional. Holden, Mass., Rules and Regs. Relating to the Construction and Use of Particular Sewers, ch. 9.5-4, Item 31, upon which the board based its sewer denial, was too vague to inform developers about the standards that had to be met for sewer systems. It also violated the mandate of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 41, &sect;&nbsp;81M. Holden, Mass., Subdivision Control Regs. &sect; V.A.1.f, which dealt with &quot;reserve strips,&quot; was also too vague. &quot;Reserve strips&quot; was an undefined term and the regulation, which prohibited all reserve strips unless determined by the board to serve the public interest, was unconstitutionally broad.</SPAN></P>

During an undercover operation, police officers observed adult males engaging in sexual conduct in full view of other patrons. The term &quot;lewd&quot; as used in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 139, &sect; 4 had been judicially defined such that it included the public exposure of genitalia, and use of the term did not render the nuisance statute unconstitutionally vague. The theater's claim of overbreadth failed as the theater could not mount a facial challenge to the statute where its conduct fell squarely within the statute's constitutional prohibitions, the statute only regulated public or nonconsenual sexual conduct, and the theater was not charged with performing the prohibited sexual acts but only with maintaining a public nuisance utilized for the commission of lewd acts. There was no freedom of expression violation because the statute did not seek to suppress constitutionally protected expressive conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff residents sued defendant city manager, seeking to compel the city manager to appoint members to fill the vacancies in the volunteer police review and advisory board (PRAB). The residents filed an emergency motion to file a memorandum of law related to the amendments to the PRAB ordinance. The city manager filed a motion to strike the motion alleging that the motion failed to raise new issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After suit was filed, the city amended the PRAB ordinance. The amendments, inter alia, mandated that PRAB members were required to be city residents when appointed, but added that if a board member ceased to be a city resident he/she was to remain on the board until a suitable candidate was appointed to fill the position. The residents alleged that the amended PRAB ordinance violated Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 41, &sect; 109, created an unconstitutional distinction between board members, and was void for vagueness. The court found that, while the amended ordinance did not limit a resigning officer's remaining term, a &quot;holdover&quot; PRAB member could, at most, have only continued to sit on the PRAB for the remainder of his term, or less than five years. Thus, contrary to the residents' arguments, the ordinance did not create different classes of members, since even &quot;resigning&quot; members could have only potentially served for the remainder of their term. The amended PRAB ordinance was consistent with Massachusetts case law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers, who paid admission to enter the theatre, made observations of men engaging in sexual acts including masturbation, oral sex, and anal sex. The conduct took place in plain view while adult films were showing depicting men and women engaging in various sexual acts. The Commonwealth maintained that defendants were keeping or maintaining a nuisance because they were permitting the theatre to be used by persons who were engaging in acts of &quot;lewdness&quot; as used in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 139, &sect; 4. The court concluded that defendants should have been aware that oral sex and anal sex fell squarely within the definition of &quot;lewdness.&quot; In addition, the Commonwealth established that the theatre allowed its premises to be used for prostitution, another basis for relief under &sect; 4. As for the First Amendment concerns raised by defendants, the court held that consenting adults do not have a right to engage in sexual intercourse in public and that because the conduct occurred in public, it did not implicate any one's right to privacy. Finally, the court concluded that an injunction could issue which prohibited the complained of acts yet was not so restrictive as to force the theatre to close.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, recipients of Transitional Aid for Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC) and a homeless coalition, sought declaratory relief under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231A to establish that the sanctioning policies and regulations for noncompliance with the TAFDC program's work requirements were unlawful. Defendants, Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) and others, filed a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed the court lacked jurisdiction over the recipients' complaint and filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). The recipients claimed they had met the prerequisites for declaratory judgment under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231A and that exhaustion of the administrative remedies would have been futile. The court held that the recipients failed to allege sufficient facts to meet the prerequisites for a declaratory judgment under Chapter 231A because there was no actual present controversy, the recipients lacked standing, and they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The court noted that the recipients' benefits had been restored and that their claims of harm pertained to potential future harm. Also the recipients never appealed the termination of their TAFDC benefits in the past, thus they had conceded the loss of their benefits for that period and their right to establish any entitlement from the DTA or in the court. The court found that the DTA's regulations, Mass. Regs. Code tit. 106, &sect;&sect; 343.250, 34 3.040, provided the &quot;exclusive&quot; procedures governing the appeal of the termination, reduction or suspension of TAFDC assistance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the TADFC recipients' declaratory judgment action that challenged the DTA's sanctions, procedures, and regulations for noncompliance with TAFDC work requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant motor vehicle registrar (RMV) suspended plaintiff driver's license under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24(1)(f), (g) and Mass. Regs. Code tit. 540, &sect; 11.01 et seq. for refusing to take a chemical test after being stopped for suspected operation of her vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (OMVUI). The Chelsea District Court (Massachusetts) upheld the suspension. The driver appealed. The RMV moved for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer stopped the driver after he saw her weaving on the road. The driver admitted to drinking two drinks, failed field sobriety tests, was arrested, requested and did not get an attorney (her husband), and refused the chemical test. The driver's claim that the interaction between her medications and the alcohol affected her ability to form a knowing consent or non-consent did not excuse her not taking the chemical test, or failing it, in spite of medical evidence defining the interaction. The driver did not have a constitutional right to consult a lawyer before making a decision to take the civil chemical test. All of the driver's alleged statutory violations under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Chemical Test Refusal Law, and various regulations, including Mass. Regs. Code tit. 501, &sect;&sect; 2.52, 9.05(6); Mass. Regs. Code tit. 540, &sect; 11.01; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 801, &sect; 1.03; unconstitutionality arguments; and substantial evidence arguments were rejected. The procedures were followed; the laws and regulations were constitutional, and there was substantial evidence supporting the RMV's decision to suspend. The OMVUI criminal acquittal was not a defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the RMV's suspension decision was supported by substantial evidence, granted the RMV's motion for judgment on the pleadings on all of the driver's counts, and effectively affirmed the lower court's judgment and the RMV's decision.</SPAN></P>

The couples claimed that they were denied the right to marry based on selective enforcement of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Just prior to the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples in accordance with the ruling in Goodridge, the State issued forms and guidance that effectively interpreted Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 207, &sect; 11 to bar municipal clerks from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples who resided in any other state. The court held the couples failed to demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on the merits. Thus, it found that a preliminary injunction was not warranted. The couples had standing. However, they failed to show that same-sex couples were being subjected to a different set of rules than were opposite-sex couples. They failed to prove their selective enforcement claim. The provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 207, which provided for different treatment of out-of-state couples, applied equally to same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Even if a fundamental right was at stake, the Privileges and Immunities argument failed since there was a valid justification for the distinction other than the mere fact of non-residency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate commenced his equal protection challenge after confinement to the DDU for a serious rules infraction. He argued that the practice violated his equal protection guarantees under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. I, as amended by Mass. Const. amend. art. CVI. The court noted that while Massachusetts precedent generally favored deference to department decisions about running prisons, precedent also mandated strict scrutiny of a challenge to a statute or regulation as applied for violation of guarantees against gender discrimination. In response to the officials' motion, which it treated as one for summary judgment because both sides had attached supporting materials, the court held particularly that if strict scrutiny were determined to be the applicable standard, it could not possibly find in favor of the inmate because although the department certainly had a compelling interest in preventing prison violence, the inmate had presented materials indicating that while a greater number of male inmates were violent, a higher proportion of female inmates engaged in violence. Furthermore, the department had not shown that the policy was narrowly drawn.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the officials' motion. It reported a question to the intermediate appellate court regarding whether the issue should be decided using rational basis scrutiny or strict scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

The board asserted in its cross-motion that the method employed by it, known as the &quot;uniform rate,&quot; conformed to Mass. Gen.

The court found that the property owners received a direct benefit from their connection to the sewer and noted that, so long as the benefit was conferred on a property, there was no requirement that the benefit was tied to every inch of the parcel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought a permit to allow her to offer tattooing services. The trial court found that the city and the Zoning Commission failed to consider evidence of a substantial government interest justifying the restrictions on body art establishments before Boston, Mass., Zoning Code art. 8, &sect; 8-7, No. 43A was enacted. Thus, the provision was unconstitutional under the First Amendment. Boston, Mass., Zoning Code art. 6, &sect; 6-3 was unconstitutional as a prior restraint on protected speech, as it authorized the denial of a permit on the basis of an unspecified assessment of a site that was &quot;an appropriate location for such use&quot; and a use that would &quot;not adversely affect the neighborhood.&quot; These factors were subjective evaluations, were unrestricted, and vested the denial of a permit in the unbridled discretion of the BOA. The owner's motion for attorneys fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1988 was granted, as her injury was caused by city officials whose acts were those of the city, and as there was a city policy that caused her injury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On defendant's motion for new trial, the court considered whether records that had been in the possession of the Commonwealth that were unavailable to him at the time of trial but which became available after his conviction constituted newly discovered evidence that was material and credible, thereby entitling him to postconviction relief. Issues included whether the grounds he raised were barred by the waiver doctrine, Mass. R. Crim. P. 30(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree and armed robbery. On appeal, after considering the applicability of the waiver doctrine, the court ruled that the case was an &quot;extraordinary case&quot; where, in the absence of postconviction relief, a &quot;miscarriage of justice&quot; would result. Further consideration of the issues was warranted both in the exercise of discretion and because certain grounds could not have been raised in defendant's original or amended motion. The court ruled that the evidence was newly discovered in that, prior to the court's ordering production of the materials, he had been deprived of access to the criminal records of Commonwealth witnesses, witness statements, police reports, and notes regarding the criminal investigation. The court explained how the various records could have been used by defendant's counsel at trial. The records, which bordered on exculpatory material that the Commonwealth should have disclosed, were both credible and material. Inter alia, they showed that defendant's counsel had a conflict of interest as to other persons involved in the crimes. The newly discovered evidence cast real doubt on the justice of defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Although the testimony of one of the Commonwealth's witness was flawed, the court concluded that it was sufficiently cured by giving the grand jurors the videotapes of the interviews. In addition, there was no evidence that the flawed testimony was presented knowingly for the purposes of obtaining an indictment or that it influenced the grand jurors' decision. Defendant also argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the indictments. The court disagreed, noting that, among other things, while defendant's conduct may have not have amounted to violations of the alleged statutes in all circumstances, when viewed in the applicable context, defendant's actions were sufficient to support the indictment. Finally, defendant argued that the statutes, as applied to him, were unconstitutional because he was not sufficiently apprised of the fact that his actions were criminal. The court disagreed, noting that, given the circumstances in which defendant did the alleged acts, his conduct was clearly prohibited by the applicable statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff adult video store owner sued defendant city under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, 11H, challenging the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance. The court permanently enjoined the city from enforcing the ordinance. The store owner petitioned under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &sect; 11I, for an award of attorneys fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance restricted the location of adult entertainment businesses. The city found that the owner's adult video store did not comply with the ordinance. The court found that the ordinance constituted an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech. The store owner was therefore the prevailing party for purposes of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &sect; 11I. The store owner sought a fee award of $ 1,209,585.33, an amount that the court found was not so grossly excessive as to warrant total disallowance. However, time records showed a considerable amount of unnecessary duplication of services. In its lodestar calculation, the court took into account the effect of the city's obstructionist conduct, which unduly prolonged the litigation. In addition, the complex nature of the litigation increased the fee. Although expert fees were unavailable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 in a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action, such fees could be awarded under state law. The court found that a lodestar calculation of 3100 hours at an average hourly rate of $ 280 was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The store owner was awarded $ 868,000 in attorneys fees and costs plus $ 47,027 in expert fees, for a total award of $ 915,027.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the appellate court held that the indictments for threats, extortion, and stalking were dismissed. However, the appellate court found that acts by two defendants which preceded the street protests were not protected by the First Amendment. As there was evidence linking the two defendants to those acts, the indictments against those two defendants charging criminal harassment and conspiracy to commit that crime were supported by evidence and not subject to dismissal.</SPAN></P>

At that point, the customer decided, as many plaintiffs had, to challenge the constitutionality of the $ 120 annual fee that &sect; 4D imposed on every plaintiff, every year that a civil suit remained in the Massachusetts courts. The court held that there was no constitutional violation. It did not violate substantive due process, because it was imposed only on non-indigent litigants, did not interfere with non-indigent plaintiffs' access to the courts, and reasonably related to the legislative purpose of discouraging frivolous continuation of lawsuits. It did not violate equal protection, because it was neither arbitrary nor irrational.

It was not a &quot;case specific&quot; assessment in that it depended on the particular allegations or defenses in any individual case, nor was the challenge case specific. The court held that the challenge to the fee was to be construed as a claim for declaratory relief under Mass. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 32-year-old male, was charged by indictment with eight counts of sexual criminal conduct after a 14-year-old female told authorities that she drank beer defendant provided, became drunk, and had sexual intercourse with defendant several times. Defendant pled guilty to the charges, but challenged the constitutionality of the Massachusetts Community Parole Supervision for Life Law and asked the trial court not to sentence him to community parole supervision for the remainder of his life. The trial court held that (1) the Community Parole Supervision for Life Law did not violate the separation of powers doctrine found in Mass. Const. pt. I, art. XXX; (2) because the prosecutor did not file a motion asking the court not to impose lifetime parole as part of defendant's sentence and because defendant was convicted of violating Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 22A, the court had an obligation to consider whether defendant should be sentenced to lifetime parole; and (3) defendant showed by clear and convincing evidence, including evidence that he had no history of sexual abuse or sexual interest relating to children, that imposition of lifetime parole was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on charges of trafficking in cocaine. Defendant moved to suppress the seized evidence, alleging violations of his federal and state constitutional rights. Defendant asked the court to address whether a legitimate stop could withstand scrutiny when objective evidence suggested the stop was based not on the underlying traffic violations of failure to drive in the right hand lane, but on defendant's race.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped the car in which defendant, who was Hispanic, was a passenger as a result of its driving in the left lane. The officer subsequently observed a small glassine bag on the driver's side floor which was later determined to be cocaine. Another officer was called to assist. The officers discovered a large amount of cocaine in the trunk. Defendant submitted statistical evidence of racial profiling by the officers. The court held the Commonwealth's failure to move to strike the evidence constituted a waiver of the right to object to its admissibility. The evidence showed the first officer stopped Hispanics at a rate 1,960 percent greater than that of Caucasians. Defendant provided sufficient information to demonstrate that minority drivers were stopped and searched with greater frequency than non-minority drivers. No race neutral explanation was proffered by the Commonwealth. The court found the officer stopped the car because of the race of the occupants. The court concluded the officer violated defendant's constitutional rights. All evidence seized during the course of the search and seizure was suppressed. All subsequent evidence was fruit of the poisonous tree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his conviction on guilty plea of two counts each of rape of a child and indecent assault and battery on a child, defendant moved the court not to impose lifetime parole as part of his sentence. He offered no evidence of mitigating factors, but challenged the constitutionality of the scheme codified at Mass. Gen. Laws chs. 265, &sect; 45; 275, &sect; 18; and 127, &sect; 133D.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a child rapist, defendant fell within the category of serious sex offenders for whom, after completion of any prison term, community parole supervision for life was mandated by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 275, &sect; 18 unless the offender carried a burden to produce clear and convincing evidence of mitigating factors making such supervision unjust. The court considered defendant's various constitutional challenges and found them groundless. There was no unconstitutional delegation of judicial authority, because the legislature was empowered to set punishments. There was no double jeopardy violation, because two-component punishments were not the same as two punishments. The scheme provided ample due process protections, including a right to appeal, and did not shift the burden of proof, but simply required a person already found guilty beyond reasonable doubt to produce some mitigating evidence to avoid a punishment that was already under the statutory maximum. Finally, since Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211E, &sect; 3 provided a generally applicable list of sentencing factors, the scheme was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him because, although he knowingly possessed the weapons at issue, he did not know his license had been invalidated by changes in the law. The court held that defendant omitted to act by failing to comply with a law of which he had no notice or reasonable knowledge. Pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted by Lambert and its progeny, defendant's violation of Mass. Gen.

Laws ch. 40B, &sect; 17, from the refusal of defendant building inspector, affirmed by an evenly divided defendant Zoning Board of Appeals (Massachusetts), to halt construction of a home on two adjoining and nonconforming lots.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building inspector said the building was a reconstruction of a previously existing cottage. The abutter had standing to challenge the issuance of a building permit as she could try to prevent construction in a district where existing development was more dense than applicable zoning regulations allowed. The building inspector was in error because the previously existing cottage was demolished more than two years earlier, so any reconstruction had to follow the existing zoning bylaw, and it did not. The proposed reconstruction created a new nonconformity as it was closer than the cottage had been to a side lot line. The new house straddled the line between two parcels separately owned until five days before trial. As a result, each lot was treated separately, including setback requirements. The grandfathering provision of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &sect; 6, para. 4, was unavailable as the lot, whether the two lots combined or each separately, did not satisfy minimum lot size requirements. The house violated the building height restriction in Town of Billerica, Mass., Zoning Bylaw &sect; 8.1, as it was more than two and one-half stories high.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The enabling act that established the commission gave local officials of the three member cities considerable power over property that fell within the redevelopment area. Nonetheless, the landowner lacked standing to challenge a provision that allegedly allowed a mayor to veto certain arrangements it had sought to conclude with the commission, because there was no showing of an actual grievance, that the mayor had actually vetoed anything. The commission was protected from liability for tortious interference with contractual and advantageous relations under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258, &sect; 10(c), and individual officials were protected by qualified immunity. Even if the commission had acted dishonestly, it had not violated Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, because it was acting in furtherance of its legislative mandate. Inverse condemnation was insufficiently pled in the absence of pleading that the landowner had been deprived of all beneficial use of its property. Finally, there was no spot zoning because the landowner was not treated differently from others in the regulated district.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 12, &sect; 11 et seq., and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 by defendants, an agency and prison officials, claiming that defendants failed to provide a diet that satisfied their religion and by permitting inmates who were not regular congregation members to participate in religious services. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Orthodox Muslims were prohibited from eating meat that had not been ritually slaughtered, i.e., meat which was not Halaal. Defendants did not provide Halaal meat on a daily basis. Defendants provided special meals to celebrate Muslim religious feasts. Any inmate who placed their name on a Ramadan list was permitted to participate in the feasts, regardless of their religion. The court held that the prisoners failed to show that a meatless diet did not comply with their religion. Therefore, the prisoners' free exercise and equal protection rights were not violated by the decision not to provide Halaal meat. As to the Ramadan list, the court held that there was no support for the prisoners' claim that eligibility to be placed on the list should be limited to Muslims who regularly participated in services or whose beliefs were congruent with the prisoners' in all respects. However, the court held that the presence of those who did not profess to have a sincere interest in the Islamic faith eliminated the communality which was an essential component of a meaningful religious service. Therefore, defendants' policies impinged on the prisoners' free exercise rights to that extent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' motion for summary judgment was allowed as to the dietary claims, and to the extent that the prisoners claimed that the officials violated their First Amendment rights by including on the Ramadan list Muslims who did not regularly attend prayer meetings or whose beliefs did not coincide with their own in all respects. The prisoners' motion for summary judgment was allowed as to the claim concerning non-Muslims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Unbeknownst to the mother, the older brother had purchased a paint ball gun and kept it hidden at home. The younger brother found the gun and took it so that he and three other boys, including the injured party could play with it. The injured party was shot in the eye by another boy who had been given the paint ball gun by the younger brother. The court held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect;&sect; 12B, 12A did not apply to paint ball guns. Thus, there was no per se negligence. However, a paint ball gun constituted a dangerous instrumentality when the participants using such guns were unsupervised minors not wearing protective gear. There were genuine issues of material fact as to the events that led up to the injury. A jury had to decide whether the younger brother, at age 14, appreciated the danger inherent in allowing the other boy to shoot the gun. A genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the older brother was negligent in storing the paint ball gun at his mother's house. A jury could not conclude the mother knew or should have known that a paint ball gun was in her home.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 40C.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Historic Districts Act allowed local governments to establish historic district commissions and to allow certain exemptions (as for driveways or storm doors) from the coverage of their historic preservation ordinances. The challenged Springfield ordinance completely exempted property owned by the local library and museum association and the Roman Catholic bishop. By the time the matter came to court, the historic home in question had already been demolished, but the court proceeded to declare the ordinance invalid, finding that while the neighbor had not established a particular injury for purposes of standing, the trust had alleged injury to its whole purpose for existence. Nothing in the act granted the power to exempt the property of particular landowners, charitable or not, and the ordinance subverted the whole statutory purpose of promoting the educational, cultural, economic, and general welfare of the public through the preservation and protection of distinctive buildings and places significant in the history of the commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 76, &sect; 15C, required students in a health science program who came in contact with patients to be immunized against various communicable diseases. Plaintiff, a speech pathology graduate student, sought a preliminary injunction against defendant health institute prohibiting it from administratively dismissing her because she refused to be immunized on religious grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student notified the institute that because of her religious beliefs, she would not submit to being immunized. The institute informed her that since immunization was an essential part of matriculation, failure to be immunized would result in an incomplete degree. The student stated she belonged to an informal group of persons who believed one's body could take care of itself and that people should not put foreign substances into their bodies. The court held the student failed to meet her burden of showing a sincerely held religious belief. The only evidence provided by the student was that she had never been vaccinated. The opposition to vaccines was not a religious issue per se. Thus, she could not rely on the First Amendment to ground her irreparable harm argument. Also, there would have been no irreparable financial harm. In addition, there was unrefuted evidence that the failure to vaccinate would cause a serious harm to the public at large. The risk of endangering people was far too great to tip the scales in favor of granting the injunction. Finally, it was likely the student's action in regard to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 76, &sect; 15C, would fail upon the merits.</SPAN></P>

Defendant made inculpatory statements after being arrested elsewhere and taken to the apartment. The statements were not sufficiently attenuated from the illegal entry. A search warrant for the second apartment was based on an affidavit containing an officer's untrue statements, and observations made after the illegal entry, all of which had to be excised, in determining probable cause. The affidavit contained statements by another, who police stopped without an articulable suspicion of wrongdoing. Given the egregious nature of the stop, defendant had &quot;target standing&quot; to raise the other person's Fourth Amendment violation, and those statements were excised.

The terms of the consent decree conflicted with the agreement between the town and the company under which the latter was not charged for the costs of wastewater collection. Under the new sewer user charge system, the company would be charged a portion of the wastewater collection system's costs that exceeded the costs it had earlier voluntarily agreed to pay. The court held that the parties' original agreement was terminated when the town adopted the new user charge system. The company had notice of the proposed changes in the fee structure, but failed to negotiate changes to the regulations, or to exhaust its administrative remedies by seeking an abatement. Rescission of the contract was not a Contract Clause violation, as the company had no reasonable expectation that the contract would last in perpetuity, and the user charge system was reasonably necessary to serve important public purposes. Under the Emerson College test, the fees were valid user fees, not unlawful taxes.</SPAN></P>

Because the marriage statutes did not concern public employment, were not enacted to confer special privileges, and embodied a legislative decision that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples furthered the public interest, they were not invalid under Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 6. Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 7 was the people's right to institute and change government and was not a basis to invalidate the legislature's limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples. Based on history and the actions of the people's elected representatives, a right to same-sex marriage was not so rooted in tradition that a failure to recognize it violated fundamental liberty, nor was it implicit in ordered liberty. By excluding the couples from marriage, the Commonwealth did not deprive them of substantive due process, liberty, or freedom of speech or association. Limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples was rationally related to a legitimate state interest of encouraging procreation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's new trial motion asserted trial counsel was ineffective for failing to anticipate this ruling, stating that if she had anticipated it, he would have accepted the Commonwealth's plea bargain. Defendant's argument was waived because appellate counsel, not employed by the same firm as trial counsel, did not raise it on direct appeal. The appellate court elected to consider the merits of defendant's motion nevertheless. Defendant had to show both serious incompetency of counsel and that this incompetency deprived him of a fair trial. Counsel did not have to anticipate an appellate court decision.

The court of appeals affirmed the conviction on appeal and the supreme judicial court denied further appeal. Seeking postconviction relief, defendant later filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 248, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted in his habeas action that (1) he was found not guilty of rape, which was charged in a separate indictment; (2) the indictment for rape and the indictment for the offense of which he was convicted were duplicative and exposed him to double jeopardy; (3) the jury was improperly instructed on the issue of knowledge; and (4) his trial counsel was ineffective. The trial court noted that there was no question that defendant was incarcerated pursuant to his conviction and that his claims for relief centered on the indictment, trial, conviction, and sentencing stages of the criminal proceedings against him. Thus, a motion for postconviction relief under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30, rather than a habeas petition, was the proper vehicle for addressing defendant's grievances. The fact that defendant raised an ineffective assistance of counsel issue did not change the circumstances, as the postconviction avenue to pursue that claim was Rule 30. Defendant's statement in his petition that his petition was not a Rule 30 motion for a new trial was also of no consequence, as defendant could not force a writ of habeas corpus where the law did not allow it under the facts.</SPAN></P>

The court that reviewed the conservation commission's denial of the landowner's application held that the action was supported by substantial evidence (much of the driveway was not on the landowner's land), and was not arbitrary and capricious because it helped effectuate a local wetlands protection scheme that accorded with the policies underlying the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, specifically Mass.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient brought suit against defendant doctor alleging that he was negligent in failing to accurately diagnose a frozen section of patient's brain tissue. Immediately prior to trial, the patient moved to allow attorney voir dire of the jury venire.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that when one considered the far greater amount of time needed for attorney voir dire (with all that meant for the administration of justice in busy courts) and the risk that the questions asked by counsel would instill bias as well as reveal it, extensive judicial voir dire was a far better solution to alleviate the risk of juror bias than the attorney voir dire suggested by the patient. Attorney voir dire, especially lengthy attorney voir dire, could reveal juror bias, but was more likely to be used to allow counsel more accurately to determine which jurors would be favorably, or unfavorably, disposed towards their arguments so that they could choose a jury more likely to reach the verdict they sought. Every party was entitled to a fair and impartial jury, not to a favorable jury. The court denied the motion for attorney voir dire.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's outpatient insurance benefits were reduced. She was not a member of a suspect class, and the limitation on her benefits was rationally related to a legitimate state interest of offering affordable insurance coverage to the state's employees. She did not show the commission had no conceivable basis for its policy or that the policy violated her substantive due process rights by shocking the conscience or interfering with an identified liberty or property interest. The policy did not mandate her institutionalization, as her receipt of outpatient benefits had no bearing on her hospitalization. Mass. Const. art. Amend. 114, prohibiting employment discrimination due to disability, did not require a heightened scrutiny of her claim. The commission's plan did not violate Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &sect; 4(16) by requiring mentally ill disabled employees to be institutionalized to obtain disability benefits beyond one year. The commission's plan was not covered by the &quot;safe harbor&quot; provision of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &sect; 4, para. 17, which only applied to age discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The trial court disagreed.  49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30103(b)(1) stated that states were permitted to maintain their own motorcycle helmet laws as long as the state standard was identical to the federal standard. In addition, Mass. Regs. Code tit. 540, &sect; 22.08 required that motorcyclists wear helmets that meet or exceed the federal standards.

Laws ch. 6, &sect; 178K provided for classification of convicted sex offenders into one of three levels. All were required to register, but information was actively disseminated to the community only about Level Three offenders. An offender classified as Level Three sought judicial review, pursuant to Mass Gen. Laws ch. 6, 178M, of his classification. The court agreed that the Massachusetts Sex Offender Registry Board had committed clear error when it accepted its hearing examiner's classification recommendation, despite the fact that the examiner, when considering certain factors listed at Mass. Regs. Code tit. 803, &sect; 1.40, had weighed factors that were clearly inapplicable and had failed to assign scores to various factors in accordance with Mass. Regs. Code tit. 803, &sect; 1.39.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the child pornography statute failed to penalize the alleged conduct because the computer images could never have been &quot;possessed,&quot; as employed in the statute. The court ruled that computer images were capable of possession, and that the legislature intended dissemination to occur at the moment the visual materials were entered into the channels of communication. One who unlawfully inserted these materials into the process of publication was a disseminator within the statute. The construction of the terms &quot;picture&quot; and &quot;photograph,&quot; had to be allowed reasonably to reflect technological advances. Were courts to follow defendant's argument, every technological advance could not be recognized by a court without a special statutory amendment. The statutes under which the indictments were laid did not offend defendant's rights under the First Amendment or Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 16. The warrant authorizing seizure of the computer and data storage devices was reasonably related to the probable cause recited by the affidavit, did not authorize a general search, and did not fail for want of particularity.</SPAN></P>

The authority also contended that the additional allegations the plaintiffs sought to include were irrelevant. Plaintiffs alleged that the authority did not adhere to customary criteria in selecting the property as a site for a park and ride facility. Specifically, plaintiffs argued that ease of ingress and egress was a principal criterion for selection of a site, and the fact that commuters must exit the turnpike to utilize the park and ride, violated the spirit and intent of the enabling statute. Plaintiffs further alleged that the authority took more land than was necessary. The court held that taken in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, the factual allegations supported plaintiffs' claims of bad faith and satisfied the specificity requirement in Mass. R. Civ.

When decedent failed to drop the gun, as the officers ordered him to do, an officer shot and killed the decedent. In federal court, the estate representative asserted a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and two state claims, wrongful death and negligence. The federal court dismissed the &sect; 1983 claim, finding that the officer's conduct was objectively reasonable. The remaining claims were remanded to state court. The city filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that the remaining state claims were barred by collateral estoppel. The court agreed. The wrongful death and negligence claims required the court to determine whether the officer's conduct was reasonable. As the federal court had already determined that the officer's conduct was objectively reasonable, the estate representative could not relitigate the issue. Summary judgment was also appropriate, because the estate representative could not use a one-time report commissioned by the city to assess the police department's strengths and weaknesses to support her negligence claim, as it constituted hearsay.</SPAN></P>

The operator and the owner contended that the insurance company engaged in unfair settlement practices including libel, slander, interference with a contractual relationship, ethnic profiling, and violation of Mass.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both sides moved for summary judgment as plaintiff newspaper sought a declaration that certain docket numbers were public records under the Massachusetts public records statute,&nbsp;Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 66, &sect; 10, and their release. The prosecutors argued that the information was protected under the Massachusetts Criminal Offender Record Information statute,&nbsp;Mass.  Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A newspaper reporter investigating municipal corruption requested that district attorneys disclose docket numbers of all such prosecutions over a period of years, and her employer sought declaratory and injunctive relief when several prosecutors responded that they believed the information was protected by the Massachusetts Criminal Offender Record Information statute,&nbsp;Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 6, &sect;&sect; 167 et seq. The court noted, first, that the Massachusetts public records statute,&nbsp;Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 66, &sect; 10, presumed that public records were subject to release unless specifically exempted. The exemptions for criminal records all focused on protecting an individual's private records, not on protecting a broad range of information sought about particular types of criminal activity. Furthermore, the information fell within the spirit of three of the exceptions to protection contained at Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 6, &sect; 172.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the newspaper's motion for declaratory judgment. It declined, however, to summarily decide whether compliance would be too expensive and cumbersome.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the decision not to renew the dealer's firearm dealers license was supported by substantial evidence. The license was denied because the dealer's place of business was not located at a separate business address, as required by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 123. The dealer's business was located in his home garage. Even though the garage had a separate entrance accessible from the outside, it was attached to his house and shared the same residential address. Thus, the dealer's business was not separate from his residence, under the common law definition of residence. Chapter 140, read as a whole, clearly reflected the legislature's intent that firearm businesses be conducted in commercial settings and not in private residences.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 175, &sect; 19E, the Massachusetts mutual insurance company conversion law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court concluded that the commissioner properly approved defendant's proposed conversion plan, pursuant to &sect; 19E. The plan complied with all of the statutory requirements, and the commissioner acted in accordance with the procedural directives. The commissioner was charged with determining whether or not the proposed demutualization plan was prejudicial to policyholders or to the insuring public and whether the plan provided policyholders with appropriate consideration for their membership interests, based on a fair and reasonable formula. Thus, the statute specifically granted the commissioner the discretion to evaluate the overall fairness of the proposed plan. Accordingly, the court found no error in the commissioner's approval of the plan and that the evidence was more than adequate to support her conclusions. Also, because all of the arguments underlying the claims against defendant were addressed by the commissioner's decision, and because the commissioner properly rejected those arguments, plaintiffs' claims of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and statutory violations against defendant was not subject to further judicial review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner department of corrections filed a motion asking the court (Massachusetts) to reconsider an earlier memorandum and order which declared that petitioner had failed to provide a county district attorney with six months written notice of defendant's scheduled release date, as required under Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 123A, &sect; 12(a), for sex offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the court wrote in its earlier decision that there was no dispute petitioner had failed to comply with its obligation to give six months notice of defendant's release to district attorney's office, the court inferred from the affidavit and subsequent statements of an assistant district attorney that the district attorney's office had first learned of defendant's scheduled release on June 1, 2000. That inference was made in error. In fact, petitioner on January 27, 2000 gave timely written notice of defendant's release, which at that time was scheduled for July 31, 2000. Although petitioner timely furnished notice on January 27, no action was taken by district attorney's office with respect to the notice until June 1. As a result, the court amended its prior decision by finding petitioner acted timely and properly in giving notice to the district attorney's office. In order to effectuate the legislature's purpose in enacting Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 123A, &sect; 12(a), the court required the district attorney's office, to avoid sanctions for extending a defendant's period of incarceration, had to act on release date information provided by petitioner in a reasonably prompt manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Motion for reconsideration was allowed to extent the court found petitioner did provide district attorney's office with six months notice required under law. Court found district attorney's office simply failed to act on this notice in a reasonably prompt manner. Revised finding did not affect court's earlier order requiring petitioner to provide defendant with sexual offender treatment pending the final adjudication of the petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiffs, a tattoo artist and a person desiring to receive tattoos, filed suit against defendant, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for a declaration that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 34 (1957) (amended 1962), the Massachusetts statute prohibiting tattooing except by qualified physicians, was facially void because it violated U.S. Const. amend. I and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. XVI. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tattoo artist was an award-winning tattoo artist who wished to practice his business in Massachusetts. He was licensed as a tattooist by the City of New York where he worked. The person was a resident of Massachusetts who desired to receive tattoos from the tattoo artist without being required to leave the State of Massachusetts. The tattoo artist and the person contended that the acts of creating and wearing tattoos were constitutionally protected forms of expression. The court found that the person did not have standing as a plaintiff to challenge the statute as the statute prohibited the act of tattooing, but not the receipt or the display of tattoos. However, even where the Commonwealth had legitimate governmental interests that were unrelated to speech, a content-neutral regulation of speech such as Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 34, could only be maintained if it did not burden substantially more speech than was necessary to address the Commonwealth's interests. The statute was substantially overbroad and unduly burdened the tattoo artist's right to constitutionally protected expression. It was, therefore, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for summary judgment was allowed as to the person, and was otherwise denied.

DOC had failed to notify a district attorney six months before defendant was to be released from prison as required by Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 123A, &sect; 12(a). As a result, the sexually dangerous person petition was only filed when defendant completed his prison term. He was held in civil custody since then, awaiting trial on the sexually dangerous person petition.

Petitioner brought a pro se petition for habeas corpus challenging his confinement to the treatment center. Petitioner asserted numerous arguments in support of his challenge. Respondent sought dismissal of the suit. The trial court found that the commitment statute had a remedial, nonpunitive purpose.

The court allowed plaintiff's motion for summary judgment but denied defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment. The court concluded that plaintiff was entitled to judgment on the issue of whether defendants violated the WPA because, based on the undisputed facts, the court found defendants violated the express provisions of the WPA by making alterations to their property within the 200 feet buffer zone, and the exemptions in the statute did not apply to defendants' modifications as a matter of law. Further, the court determined that the WPA did not effect a taking on its face or as applied to defendants' property under either the United States or Massachusetts Constitutions. Finally, the court concluded defendants did not offer any evidence to support their argument that the WPA was applied inconsistently or outside the legislative mandate.</SPAN></P>

Defendant agency's regulations regarding benefit entitlement were invalid and unenforceable to the extent that the conflicted with legislative intent regarding the emergency assistance program. Plaintiffs established that the legislative purpose in both the enabling statute,&nbsp;Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 18, &sect; 2, and the annual budget provided for in 1999 Mass. Acts ch. 127, &sect; 2, conflicted with the promulgated regulations at issue. The court interpreted both statutes as narrowing defendant agency's authority to change eligibility conditions or provided benefits by being able to do so only when defendant department was faced with a deficiency in its emergency assistance budget. No such deficiency was shown. Challenged regulations that were not benefit changes but a clarification of existing, obvious policy were allowed to stand.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, this court orders that plaintiffs Graves and Martinello's 122 licenses be reinstated and that the defendant chiefs of police Erickson and Hebert be enjoined from terminating said licenses without due notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard prior thereto as provided under G.L.c. 140, 125.  <BR></SPAN></P>

Treating defendants' motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 56, the court granted defendants' motion as to plaintiffs' equal protection and vagueness claims. The court found there was a rational basis for the distinction between classes of gun dealers and the statute was not impermissibly vague. The court granted summary judgment in part on the due process claim because the statute was not unconstitutional as enacted where it contained notice and hearing provisions, but denied summary judgment in part because the statute violated plaintiffs' due process rights as applied.

Laws ch. 212, &sect; 3A(d) and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &sect; 2A. The driver's motion for reconsideration and to vacate the judgment was denied. The driver appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that &sect; 3A(d) clearly rendered &sect; 32 inapplicable.

Nothing in the driver's brief warranted a departure from the principle that excluded any consideration of, or decision on, constitutional questions unless they necessarily had to be reached. The driver did not prove that there were no conceivable grounds that supported the constitutional validity of &sect; 3A(d). The driver's conclusory claim that his failure to comply with the &sect; 3A(d) thirty-day time requirement was attributable to his attorney, and that that failure constituted a mistake or excusable neglect entitling him to Mass. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1) relief was rejected. The driver failed to explain or justify his noncompliance with &sect; 3A(d). The fact that it was his attorney's action did not automatically satisfy the driver's considerable burden under Rule 60(b) of demonstrating that any mistake or neglect was excusable and not due to simple carelessness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tenant appealed the judgment by the Chelsea District Court (Massachusetts) that awarded possession to plaintiff Housing Authority of the apartment she was renting from the Authority. The tenant argued that the Authority violated her right to procedural due process by basing her eviction on provisions in the lease that were vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Authority notified the tenant that she had failed to report additional income for three years. The tenant claimed that the eviction was in retaliation for her complaining to the local board of health about mice in her apartment. She also filed counterclaims alleging breaches of the warranties of habitability and quiet enjoyment. The jury concluded that judgment was to enter for the Authority for possession, but did not assess any money damages. There was evidence that the tenant failed to report an increase in income on multiple occasions. The appellate court concluded that the tenant had a very strong private interest in her access to public housing. On the other hand, the Authority had a significant governmental interest in its ability to provide housing, which could be negatively impacted if tenants did not pay their fair share while other people remained on its waiting list. A person of common intelligence would have understood that the rule was not limited to situations where the tenant obtained a new job or received a raise or promotion. Rent was assessed based on income. Income was the issue, not how the tenant made it. Thus, the verdict was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
