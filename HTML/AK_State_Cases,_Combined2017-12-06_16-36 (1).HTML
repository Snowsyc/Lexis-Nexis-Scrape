</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, who was intoxicated enough to have slurred speech, began vomiting at defendant's apartment. Another teenage cousin got up to check on the victim and saw defendant lying on top of the victim. Defendant's pants were down, and the victim was naked from the waist down. Defendant got up and twice said he was sorry. The victim began to cry and asked the cousin to call the police. The victim had sustained several abrasions and lacerations to her genitalia. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing evidence of defendant's prior sexual assault against his 19-year-old niece. Both sexual assaults involved situations in which defendant, who was in his thirties, took advantage of a young female relative who was asleep and/or impaired by intoxication. Even assuming that the trial court should have given defendant's proposed instruction on &quot;force,&quot; any error was harmless in light of the parties' arguments. Given the totality of circumstances surrounding defendant's offenses, the trial court did not commit clear error when it found that defendant failed to establish that his conduct was among the least serious under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.155(d)(9).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded no contest to three felonies as part of a plea bargain with the State. He then filed a motion to withdraw his pleas. The Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska), ruled that defendant had failed to present a fair and just reason for withdrawing his pleas and denied his motion to withdraw his pleas. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl. Defendant took sexually suggestive photos of the girl and he also made videotapes of their sexual relations. The photographs and videos were apparently made for private, non-commercial purposes. However, those materials came to the attention of the authorities when defendant's son brought the briefcase to the police. Even though defendant's sexual relations with the girl were lawful, he had violated Alaska's exploitation of minors statute. Additionally, after further investigation, it was revealed that defendant had given LSD to three minors. Defendant then pleaded guilty to a single class A felony for the LSD charges, exploitation of a minor, and possession of child pornography. With regards to the motion to withdraw his pleas, the trial judge found that defendant's alleged mistake concerning the admissibility of police testimony did not substantially affect his decision-making with regards to plea bargain as his desire to spare his family the stress of a trial was his main motivation in accepting the plea bargain; thus, that mistake was not a fair and just reason for allowing him to withdraw his pleas.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks, Alaska, convicting him of four counts of indecent viewing or photography and four counts of attempted indecent viewing or photography, in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.61.123(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police seized 60 videotapes from defendant's home depicting a minor dressing and undressing at separate times in the garage and the bathroom. Defendant created the videotapes by placing hidden cameras throughout his home. In his criminal appeal, defendant argued that: (1) his convictions for indecent viewing or photography and attempted indecent viewing or photography should have been vacated, as the indecent viewing statute,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.61.123, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad; and (2) that, as the indecent material was contained on a single videotape, he committed only a single violation of the statute. The appellate court rejected defendant's contention that the indecent viewing statute was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad as applied in this case, because defendant's conduct was core conduct prohibited by the statute. Because defendant's separate convictions were based on separate incidents of indecent viewing or photography, he was subject to eight separate convictions.</SPAN></P>

The judge recognized that the inmate was raising two separate claims: that a plea entered without counsel was manifestly unjust, and that a plea entered without the benefit of discovery was not an informed decision. After setting out Alaska R. Crim. P. 11(h)(4), which listed the circumstances that required a court to allow a plea withdrawal to correct manifest injustice, the judge properly dismissed the inmate's application.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded no contest to felony driving while intoxicated (DWI) but asserted that his presumptive sentencing range was increased by improper application of aggravating factors under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.155(c). Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence in the Superior Court, Second Judicial District, Barrow (Alaska).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that increasing his sentencing range based on prior DWI convictions violated state and federal protections against double jeopardy, and that the sentencing court improperly weighed aggravating factors based on a delinquency adjudication which would have been an adult felony and defendant's history of prior similar offenses. The appellate court first held that defendant's constitutional claim was not preserved for review and, moreover, the fact that defendant's prior offenses triggered a more severe sentencing range for the instant offense did not constitute the type of double punishment that was constitutionally forbidden. Further, the aggravators based on the delinquency adjudication and prior DWI offenses were properly applied and justifiably given substantial weight in view of defendant's failure to respond to rehabilitative efforts, the need to protect the public and deter future criminal conduct, and the growing public perception that drunk driving is a serious social problem deserving of increased condemnation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the minor in possession statute,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 04.16.050(c) was unconstitutional, that the district court should have suppressed evidence to sanction the State for discovery violations, that there was insufficient evidence to corroborate her admission in court and to support her conviction, and that her possession was too fleeting to subject her to criminal liability. The appellate court rejected defendant's unconstitutionality argument when she appealed her first conviction for minor in possession. The holding in that appeal disposed of defendant's current claims that the statute violated her rights to equal protection and privacy. When given an opportunity at trial to identify any information the State should have provided under Alaska R. Crim. P. 16, defendant failed to do so. There was sufficient corroborating evidence to satisfy the corpus delicti rule based on the trooper's testimony that defendant was present at the party, there was a great deal of beer, and defendant smelled of alcohol.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State brought a petition for rehearing of a decision on appeal from the District Court for the Fourth Judicial District in Fairbanks (Alaska) that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.71.060(a) was unconstitutional to the extent it conflicted with the right to privacy under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 22 and criminalized possession in one's own home of less than four ounces of marijuana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with marijuana possession. In the court's first decision, it held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.71.060(a), which criminalized possession of any amount of marijuana, even for personal use in the home, was unconstitutional in that it conflicted with the privacy right protected under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 22. The court concluded that the statute could be preserved only to the extent that it prohibited possession of four ounces or more of marijuana in the home. The State petitioned for a rehearing of that conclusion, arguing, chiefly, that the court mistakenly assessed a constitutional restriction on the government's law-making power, rather than allowing an affirmative defense of the right to privacy. The court found that the State's argument was in conflict with both prior landmark decisions of court and the legislature's stated policy of defining, for privacy purposes, a specified allowed amount of marijuana for personal use in the home. The State further argued that it should be allowed to re-prosecute defendant, but the court found that collateral estoppel and double jeopardy concerns prevented a re-prosecution following acquittal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment on jury verdict of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Fairbanks (Alaska), convicting him of violating Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.71.060(a) by possessing less than eight ounces of marijuana. He argued on appeal, among other things, that he had been engaging in conduct protected by Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 22.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for marijuana possession after officers found harvested plants in his home. He argued a defense of necessity, but also challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The appellate court agreed that, in the Ravin decision, the state's highest court held that possession of small amounts of marijuana, in the home, for personal use, was protected by the privacy guarantee in the Alaska constitution. After the Ravin decision, the marijuana possession statute had used four ounces as the cutoff point between small amounts and amounts for which a person could be prosecuted, but Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.71.060, enacted by initiative, had re-criminalized possession of any amount of marijuana. The appellate court held that the people, by initiative, could no more enact an unconstitutional law than the legislature could, so, to uphold the constitutionality of &sect; 11.71.060, it interpreted that statute as if the four-ounce dividing line had never been removed and directed a new trial to determine the amount defendant actually possessed. It also held that defendant should not have raised a defense of necessity when a statutory medical use defense was available to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded for a new trial, at which the jury was to determine whether defendant possessed more or less than four ounces of marijuana.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accomplice attempted to pawn various items included on a police &quot;hot sheet.&quot; The accomplice pleaded guilty to second-degree theft as part of a plea agreement wherein he testified against defendant, who gave him the items to pawn. At the close of the State's case in chief, defendant moved for acquittal, arguing that the accomplice's testimony was not corroborated. The trial court denied the motion, ruling that an art gallery employee's identification of defendant as the thief was sufficient to corroborate the accomplice's testimony. On appeal, defendant contended the trial court erred by denying his motion for acquittal and that defendant's ability to cross-examine the accomplice was unconstitutionally restricted. The appellate court held the accomplice testimony was sufficiently corroborated to warrant denial of defendant's motion for acquittal. The judge's restriction on defendant's right to cross-examination did not impair defendant's ability to establish the accomplice's motive. The jury had ample evidence to evaluate the accomplice's credibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for first-degree and second-degree sexual assault. He ultimately reached a plea bargain with the State; under the terms of the bargain, defendant pled no contest to a single misdemeanor count, attempted third-degree sexual assault, Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.425(a). Even though defendant was convicted of a misdemeanor, that misdemeanor was nevertheless classified as a &quot;sex offense&quot; for purposes of the Sex Offender Registration Act (Act), Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.63.100(6)(C)(i). Accordingly, defendant was required to register and to report annually for a period of 15 years. He argued that the Act was unconstitutional because it amounted to an improper infringement by the legislative branch of government into sentencing matters that were entrusted to the juridical branch, but the court disagreed and affirmed. Because the Act was a regulatory measure, the registration and reporting requirements imposed by the Act were not part of defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the District Court, Fourth Judicial District, Bethel (Alaska), which convicted defendant of fourth-degree assault for squeezing his wife behind a door during an argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court allowed evidence of defendant's prior assaults on his wife and his parents. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erroneously admitted the prior bad acts evidence under Alaska R. Evid. 404(b)(1). The trial court rejected defendant's arguments. The court found the evidence allowed a reasonable jury to conclude that defendant had assaulted and injured his wife during prior domestic arguments. Defendant admitted that he had used force on his wife but claimed that he had acted in self-defense. The evidence of the prior assaults was thus relevant to resolve the difficult proof problems posed by conflicting accounts of domestic violence. Further, the evidence was not more prejudicial than probative. The assaults were not remote; all five incidents occurred within four years of the present offense, and the three assaults against the wife were within the previous 14 months. The evidence of the assaults against the wife was relevant to rebut defendant's claim of self-defense and to show the nature of their relationship. Evidence of the assault against his father was properly admitted to impeach defendant's father's testimony by showing his potential bias.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the State argued that the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion to dismiss based on the State's lack of jurisdiction to prosecute. Under the federal government's admiralty and maritime jurisdiction over U.S. flagged vessels in foreign waters, the State argued that this special jurisdiction granted the State jurisdiction under Alaska Stat. &sect; 44.03.010 to prosecute defendant's misconduct committed on an Alaskan vessel in Canadian territorial waters. The appellate court held that &sect; 44.03.010 did not extend state criminal jurisdiction into Canadian territorial waters. The court noted that the United States' authority over its flagged vessels while they were in foreign territorial waters was not exclusive. Such jurisdiction did not preclude Canada from exercising its own jurisdiction. And, even if the United States had jurisdiction over the vessel while it was in Canada's territorial waters, it did not follow that the State had the same jurisdiction, as nothing in &sect; 44.03.010 indicated that the legislature intended to assert jurisdiction over an Alaskan vessel operating outside the territorial waters specifically described in the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to dismiss the charges, as the refusal to file sworn verifications was a criminal offense, where swearing to the verifications' accuracy was required by statute. Although the jury was not clearly instructed that the State had to prove that defendant was aware of his duty to file signed and attested verifications, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as there was overwhelming evidence that defendant knew that he was obliged to sign and attest the verifications, including his explicit refusal to do so because of perjury concerns. That evidence also justified the denial of an acquittal.

Defendant then left the driver &quot;for dead&quot;. The trial court found that the offenses had been committed with deliberate cruelty, as defined in Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.155(c)(2), and that defendant's sentences should therefore be in the aggravated range. Defendant argued that the trial court had erred in making that determination and raised other issues relating to sentencing. The appellate court held that the evidence supported the trial court's finding as the injuries were inflicted gratuitously and not directly as a means of committing the crimes. The trial court properly counted the aggravator as a single episode for sentencing. The trial court could also properly find that the fact that defendant basically kidnapped the victim constituted the most serious conduct covered by the offenses. Defendant's Apprendi challenge to the imposition of consecutive sentences was without merit. The sentences were not excessive given the nature of the offense and defendant's prior record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Palmer (Alaska), which denied the defendant's motion to suppress evidence and convicted the defendant on four counts of fourth-degree misconduct involving a controlled substance and one count of second-degree theft, for growing marijuana in a warehouse and stealing electricity for that operation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the defendant argued, inter alia, that evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant executed on his property should have been suppressed because the police obtained the warrant after using a thermal imaging device to scan his warehouse. The search warrant affidavit stated that officers noticed the smell of cultivating marijuana from the defendant's warehouse, but did not mention the thermal scan, and the issuing magistrate was not told of the thermal scan. At trial, the police testified that the thermal scan was used only for training purposes, and the trial judge held that the omission was harmless error because it played no role in the actual investigation. The appellate court found, however, that the trial court did not directly answer whether the investigation that led to the lawful search intensified by reason of the thermal scan. The court stated that the failure to disclose the thermal scan could have amounted to a material omission that influenced the probable cause finding. The court remanded for explicit findings on whether the use of the thermal scan intensified or focused the investigation. The appellate court rejected the defendant's remaining issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded for additional findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of disorderly conduct in the District Court, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks (Alaska). Defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court misapplied the elements of disorderly conduct, that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction, and that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.61.110(a)(6) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by a trooper and became very agitated and refused to follow the officer's instructions. Defendant refused to take his hands out of his pockets, which caused the trooper to be concerned for his safety. A struggle developed ,and the trooper was only able to subdue defendant through the use of pepper spray and the aid of bystanders. The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that the trooper created the hazardous condition. Under Alaska State &sect; 11.61.110(a)(6), whether defendant's actions created a risk of physical injury to others, and whether defendant recklessly disregarded that risk, were questions that ultimately depended on the facts. The evidence showed that defendant knew or should have known that his continuing struggle created a hazardous condition. Consequently, the trial court properly found that the State proved that defendant had no legal justification or excuse for his actions, and the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction. Finally, &sect; 11.61.110(a)(6), by its very language, allowed conviction only for an act that had no legal justification or excuse, and, as applied to the facts, was not overly broad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner was convicted of first-degree murder, and the conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. The prisoner subsequently filed a petition for post-conviction relief, asserting communication problems between he and his attorney effectively deprived him of the assistance of counsel. The Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska) dismissed the petition as untimely. The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the prisoner challenged the superior court's ruling that his petition was untimely. The prisoner contended that any statute of limitations that barred a defendant from petitioning for post-conviction relief constituted a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, which was generally forbidden by the Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The appellate court rejected the prisoner's contention and affirmed. Prior case law clearly held the statute of limitations on petitions for postconviction relief did not violate Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The prisoner did not challenge the prior case decision, but rather, attempted to incorporate by reference arguments he presented to the superior court concerning the purported unconstitutionality of the statute of limitations. Therefore, the prisoner's brief did not satisfy Alaska R. App. P. 212(c)(1)(I), which required that the prisoner's brief contain the contentions of the prisoner with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefore. The prisoner did include a substantive discussion of the law in his reply brief, but arguments presented for the first time in a reply brief were waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree vehicle theft in the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Kenai (Alaska) for failure to return a rental car. Defendant appealed the superior court's denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal asserting he could not be prosecuted for first degree vehicle theft for taking a car pursuant to an oral or written agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued the superior court should have granted a judgment of acquittal; as he obtained possession of the car with the rental company's permission, his taking could not be &quot;trespassory.&quot; Under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.46.360(a), it was a felony to knowingly take a car belonging to another while having no right to do so. However, the legislature also enacted Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.46.365(a)(2), second-degree vehicle theft, which made it a misdemeanor to retain a vehicle beyond the time specified in a written agreement. The enactment of &sect; 11.46.365(a)(2) indicated that the legislature must have intended for the language in Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.46.360(a) to refer to a defendant's initial act of driving or taking and thereby to limit &sect; 11.46.360(a) to cases where the original taking was trespassory. Accordingly, the appellate court held that in first-degree vehicle theft cases, the State had to prove that the defendant's initial taking of the vehicle was trespassory. The trial court failed to instruct the jury that the initial taking had to be trespassory to convict for first degree vehicle theft, and the failure to so instruct constituted plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Superior Court, First Judicial District, Ketchikan (Alaska), ordered forfeiture of one-half of defendant's bond when he violated conditions of release. Subsequently, the instant court concluded that the legislature did not authorize forfeiture of bail for a defendant's non-compliance with conditions of release, as opposed to failure to appear. The superior court then granted defendant's father a refund. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the State argued that the litigation over the bond money was criminal in nature, not civil, and therefore the civil rules did not apply. However, the appellate court held that bail forfeiture litigation was primarily civil in nature and that Alaska R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4) applied to bail forfeiture litigation, giving the trial court the authority to grant relief from judgments of forfeiture. Further, the appellate court construed the bail statutes in effect at the time that the instant case was litigated in the superior court and concluded that the Alaska Legislature did not authorize courts to order forfeiture of bail for a defendant's violation of the conditions of release. Thus, the superior court had no statutory authority to order forfeiture of defendant's money, even if the State proved its allegations. Accordingly, the court's judgment was &quot;void&quot; for purposes of Rule 60(b)(4), and defendant's father was entitled to seek relief under that rule. Finally, the appellate court, citing the Fifth Amendment prohibition against the taking of one's property without due process of law, held the superior court had authority to order full restitution of the forfeited money.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were each charged with failing to file the periodic statements required under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.63.010(d). Defendants asserted that ASORA was unconstitutional. Defendants argued that the magistrate should have dismissed their cases when he dismissed another offender's case in State v. Hawkins. The instant court noted that it reversed the magistrate's decision in the Hawkins case. The legislature, when it enacted ASORA, created a continuing offense. The offender in the Hawkins case was not being prosecuted for not registering by July 1, 1994, but for not registering by January 28, 1998. Because the offender in the Hawkins case was charged with failing to register more than three years after ASORA was enacted, there was no ex post facto violation. Defendants were required to register as sex offenders. Additionally, defendants were subject to criminal penalties for failing to comply with ASORA's general duty to register. Because defendants were required to register initially as sex offenders, they were also required to file the annual or quarterly statements. When defendants failed to file the required statements, they were again subject to criminal penalties.</SPAN></P>

Because of defendant's refusal to supply her social security number, the division of motor vehicles (DMV) did not renew her license. As a general rule, when a person was charged with engaging in a licensed activity without the proper license, it was no defense that the government wrongfully refused to grant the person's earlier license application. Even when the person can show that their application should have been granted, they were not free to break the law by engaging in the licensed activity without the necessary license. No matter how strongly defendant believed that the social security number requirement abridged her freedom of religion or violated other constitutional rights, she was not at liberty to ignore the law and drive with an expired license.

The fourth caller reported the defendant would meet prospective buyers in the cemetery after they paged him with the code 411, and provided the defendant's pager number. Officers contacted the defendant while he was still in the cemetery. Police obtained a search warrant for defendant's body and residence, where they found illegal weapons and drugs. The defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized from his residence, arguing the warrant was not supported by probable cause. The trial court found the details provided by two informants established probable cause to search the residence. The evidence supported the conclusion that the defendant's activities were ongoing and the tips were not stale. The facts known to the police at the time they approached the defendant in the cemetery met the standard of reasonable suspicion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Palmer, Alaska, convicted defendant of fourth-degree controlled substance misconduct (possession of one pound or more of marijuana). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that both the Alaska constitution and federal law gave him the right to possess marijuana. Alternatively, he argued that the evidence against him was seized during the execution of a search warrant based on information that the police obtained illegally. Defendant claimed that under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 22, he had a right to possess marijuana. However, that applied only to small amounts of marijuana, and the legislature could validly prohibit possession of eight ounces of marijuana. Possession of a pound of marijuana was a crime, and therefore a court could issue a search warrant on that basis.  21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 822(c)(3) did not prevent the federal government or the states from prohibiting the possession of controlled substances, or from limiting the possession to specified purposes. The officers had probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant, based on the officers' perception of the smell of growing marijuana from the house, combined with their observation of the humidity fogging the windows and the information of high electrical usage. Defendant's other claims were waived because of his failure to adequately brief them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted in the Superior Court, First Judicial District, Petersburg (Alaska) of four counts of sexual abuse of a minor in the second degree. The defendant applied for bail pending appeal, but the court found that he was ineligible for bail because he had a prior felony conviction for attempted sexual assault in the second degree. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.30.040(b)(2) violated equal protection under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court of appeals held that it did violate equal protection under the Alaska Constitution. The court of appeals stated that under &sect; 12.30.040(b)(2), if a defendant had a prior conviction for a class B or class C sexual felony, the defendant would be ineligible for bail if that defendant was later convicted of any class B or class C felony, for example, burglary. But if the chronological order of those convictions was reversed, that is, if the defendant had a prior conviction for burglary, first-degree vehicle theft, or possession of one pound of marijuana, and the defendant's current conviction was for a class B or class C sexual felony, then the statute did not apply, and the defendant remained eligible for bail release even though the defendant was assumedly just as dangerous. The court was unable to discern a reasonable basis for denying bail to second felony offenders with prior convictions for sexual felonies while at the same time granting bail to second felony offenders with current convictions for those same sexual felonies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that while the act directed some classes of convicted sex offenders to register, and provided the time and the manner for doing so, former Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.63.010(a) (1988) did not specifically address convicted sex offenders who were unconditionally released prior to August 10, 1994. Defendants contended that former &sect; 12.63.010(a) provided registration deadlines for only three groups of offenders, none of which included defendants. Defendants concluded that either the legislature did not intend to require offenders like them to register under the act, or, alternatively, that the act was unconstitutionally vague because it did not provide them with adequate notice that they had a duty to register. The instant court rejected defendants' arguments, concluding that the legislature intended to subject convicted sex offenders, such as defendants, to criminal penalties for failing to comply with the act's general duty to register. The only sex offenders excepted from the act's registration requirements were those who had been unconditionally discharged for a single sex offense conviction before July 1, 1984.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teacher appealed from a decision of the District Court, Third Judicial District (Alaska), after he was convicted of disorderly conduct, in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.61.110, for shaking a student and pushing him up against a desk. Appellant argued that he was denied the right to a speedy trial and the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teacher shook a student and pushed him up against a desk when the student refused to stop sexually harassing a female student. Upon appellant's conviction for disorderly conduct, he appealed. The appellate court agreed with the trial court. Since appellant's attorney moved to delay the trial date because he was out of town, the speedy trial &quot;clock&quot; was tolled during the delay. The evidence showed that appellant held the student, shook him, and then pinned him against a desk so hard that the desk folded up. From those facts, coupled with appellant's size and weight, reasonable jurors could have concluded that appellant's actions posed a risk of physical harm and appellant was aware of that risk; thus, his disregard of that risk was a substantial and unjustifiable departure of a reasonable person's standard of conduct. Therefore, evidence was sufficient to support the jury's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The interference with official proceedings statute defined one offense but specified several ways in which this offense could be committed. His conviction was not subject to reversal merely because it was impossible to tell whether all twelve jurors voted for conviction under the same theory. There was no prejudicial variance between the State's proof at grand jury and the State's proof at trial. Upon review of the sentencing record, appellant's sentence of 4 years, 9 months was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

The superior court granted DOC's motion for summary disposition of appellant's claim for habeas corpus. On appeal, the court affirmed.  Alaska Stat. &sect; 33.30.031 provided that Alaska inmates could be sent to private out-of-state prisons if the commissioner if the statutory conditions were met. Application of Alaska Stat. &sect; 33.30.031(a) in the case did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws.

On appeal, he argued that the superior court erroneously admitted evidence of prior bad acts. He also contended that a jury instruction was faulty. At trial, the State sought to impeach a defense witness's credibility and establish her bias by questioning her about the application she filed in support of a restraining order against defendant. It described incidents where defendant had assaulted her. The superior court ruled that this evidence was admissible to establish the witness's bias and attack her credibility. The trial court also ruled that, under Alaska R. Evid. 403(b)(3), the witness could be cross-examined about another incident she described in the application, that defendant sexually assaulted her. The instant court rejected defendant's attacks against Alaska R. Evid. 404(b)(3). Regarding the superior court's answer to a jury question that included a statement that consent to sexual penetration could be withdrawn, the court found that defendant had not preserved an objection, and did not establish plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of third-degree assault for threatening the victim with a handgun. Defendant argued that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence of defendant's prior acts of domestic violence against the victim under Alaska R. Evid. 404(b)(1), (b)(4). There was no abuse of discretion. Defendant asserted that the evidence of his prior misconduct did not show that he could overpower the victim. But the defendant did not state his objection in these terms below, and the argument was not preserved. The acts were admitted for the very purpose advanced by the legislature: to resolve the difficult proof problems posed by conflicting accounts of domestic violence. The evidence rule also did not violate the equal protection clause. Defendant failed to show that Rule 404(b)(4) infringed on a fundamental right. Defendant argued that the legislature should have conditioned admissibility on the requirement of factual similarity to ensure that only relevant evidence was admitted. This argument was without merit. Even if the trial court erroneously admitted defendant's prior bad acts under Rule 404(b)(1), that error was harmless. The evidence was admissible under Rule 404(b)(4).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was due to be released from prison to a halfway house.

The amended complaint against appellant alleged that appellant committed third-degree assault and coercion by sending the letters. The lower court affirmed a decision revoking appellant's probation. This decision was reversed. The court was not required to address whether the state's coercion statute was overly broad, because it found that appellant had not violated the coercion statute, since he had not forced a third party to act or refrain from acting in light of threats. The letters did not constitute third degree assault, because they did not contain specific threats of personal harm directed to any identifiable person.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's petition for post-conviction relief was denied and the denial affirmed on appeal. Appellant's writ of habeas corpus was denied, and appellant filed an appeal. The court held most of appellant's claims challenging his conviction were barred by res judicata. The court reversed the trial court's finding res judicata barred appellant's assertion that his probation had been illegally extended, as it was a challenge to an administrative decision. The court vacated the trial court's dismissal of appellant's claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, as the court established what appellant must prove. The court upheld the constitutionality of Alaska R. Civ. P. 86(m), allowing post-conviction relief to supersede habeas corpus as the procedural method for collaterally attacking a criminal conviction; and Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.72.020(a)(6), which barred a defendant from pursuing successive petitions for post-conviction relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who had been convicted of second-degree murder, filed a petition for review of an order issued sua sponte from the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska), that directed appellant to refile his complaint for habeas corpus relief due to ineffective assistance of counsel as an application for post-conviction relief under Alaska R. Crim. P. 35.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced. After several petitions for post-conviction relief were denied or dismissed, appellant filed a complaint captioned as an application for writ of habeas corpus. The superior court issued a sua sponte order directing appellant to refile his complaint as an application for post-conviction relief under Alaska R. Crim. P. 35.1. Appellant challenged that order, arguing it effectively dismissed his complaint. The appellate court found that the order was proper because appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim could have been brought under Rule 35.1. Appellant claimed that he faced dismissal under the post-conviction relief procedure and that the impending dismissal amounted to a suspension of the writ, but it was not unconstitutional to place procedural limits on post-conviction relief and appellant did not claim that the underlying judgment was void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of the Superior Court, First Judicial District, Juneau (Alaska), which convicted appellant, following jury trial, of the felony of driving while intoxicated, in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030(a)(1), (a)(2), (n).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of the felony of driving while intoxicated. At trial, evidence was admitted of appellant's breath test, which indicated that his breath alcohol content was .109 percent. Appellant attempted to cross-examine a police officer about the working tolerance of the testing device, and appellee objected, arguing that Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.40.060 made this working tolerance irrelevant. The trial court sustained the objection. Appellant contended that Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.40.060 was unconstitutional because it violated his rights to due process. The court affirmed. Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.40.060 provided that if a person was required to take a chemical breath test, and the instrument was properly calibrated, then the result of the test was not affected by the margin of error of the instrument. Excluding evidence of a testing instrument's margin of error did not violate appellant's due process rights because the legislature changed the law; the instrument's margin of error was no longer relevant to the driver's guilt under Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030(a)(2). Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.40.060 did not impermissibly limit the evidence that appellant could have introduced at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for felony driving while intoxicated (DWI) in the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of felony driving while intoxicated (DWI). Appellant challenged the constitutionality of Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.280, which provided that breath test results by a properly calibrated instrument were not affected by the instrument's working tolerance. Appellant contended that this allowed approval of any instrument, even one which was very inaccurate, to establish his intoxication level. The court affirmed, holding that when the legislature passed &sect; 28.35.280, it did so knowing that the Intoximeter 3000 was the testing instrument at issue, and that its working tolerance was .01 percent. There was no indication that the legislature intended to create a statutory blood alcohol level that varied depending upon the instrument used, or to delegate the authority to set the statutory blood alcohol level for DWI. Second, there was no equal protection violation stemming from the statute's exemption of those aged 14 to 21, because minors were subject to a much more restrictive version of the DWI offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction affirmed. The legislature had the power to base the offense of DWI on a particular test result, and determine that a margin of error that it considered &quot;tolerably inaccurate&quot; could be disregarded. The legislature had the Intoximeter's long history of use in the state, and the instrument's margin of error of .01 percent was likewise well-known.</SPAN></P>

Police were not aware of sufficient facts and circumstances to warrant a prudent person in believing that appellant was driving while intoxicated or criminally at fault in causing the accident. Because appellant was arrested without probable cause, the seizure of blood was not authorized by Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.035. Police did not have probable cause to believe the pickup could be evidence relevant to charge of assault or driving while intoxicated.  Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.070 did not authorize the impoundment of the pickup for inspection of the pre-existing condition of the vehicle. Evidence should have been excluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant's exclusion from proceedings concerning her minor son, a witness, constituted harmless error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged her conviction by the District Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska) for driving while intoxicated, Anchorage, Alaska, Municipal Code 9.28.020A. She had entered a Cooksey plea, that is, a no contest plea that preserved her right to litigate a specified issue on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested for driving while intoxicated, and was asked to submit to a breath test. Appellant took the test, but claimed the results should be suppressed because the police did not inform her of her right to consult an attorney before deciding whether to take the test. Appellant was prosecuted under Anchorage, Alaska, Municipal Code 9.28.020A which provided two alternative ways of proving the offense of driving while intoxicated: proof of blood-alcohol level, or proof the defendant operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants. The court held that appellant's Cooksey plea was not valid and she had no right to appeal because even if she prevailed on suppressing the breath test results, there was substantial evidence that she was driving under the influence of intoxicants. The court remanded the case to allow appellant to withdraw her no contest plea and go to trial.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the supreme court's decision was in conflict with a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. The court held that the speech in issue was not protected by the First Amendment, and thus was not impermissibly broad, and therefore, was not in conflict with other case law. Appellant argued that he reasonably believed that he had permission to contact jurors to discuss jury nullification. The court held that none of the statements referred to by appellant could have reasonably been interpreted to authorize appellant to have personal contact with members of a jury panel with the intent to influence their decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State appealed order of Superior Court, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks (Alaska), which released respondent, who had been convicted of crime involving domestic violence and had asked for bail release during pendency of his appeal, to return to the residence of his victim, and respondent moved to dismiss petition as moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A few weeks following his initial release, respondent requested a modification of his release conditions so that he could reside in the same residence with assault victim. Before his arrest for the assault, respondent and victim had been living together in a domestic relationship. Over the state's objection, trial judge modified respondent's conditions of release to allow respondent to reside with victim. Following the court's granting of the state's petition for review, respondent moved to dismiss petition on the ground that it was moot because respondent had violated his conditions of release and was in custody. The court declined to dismiss petition as moot, concluding that the issue in the case was an appropriate one to resolve under the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine. Legislature intended to restrict courts from releasing defendants charged with or convicted of a crime of domestic violence to the residence of alleged victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction and sentence for driving under the influence by the District Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant was involved in a motor vehicle accident and police arrived, he e agreed to perform one field sobriety test; the results indicated appellant was under the influence of alcohol. Appellant refused to take two other tests; the officer arrested appellant for driving under the influence. He obtained an independent blood test locally, which yielded a result of .125 percent alcohol. Appellant was convicted, sentenced, and appealed. The conviction and sentence were affirmed. Refusal of defendant to submit to a chemical test was admissible evidence and field sobriety tests were non-testimonial, the fifth amendment offered no protection against compulsion to take them. The officer could conduct field sobriety tests based on the reasonable suspicion that the defendant was driving while intoxicated. A repeat driving while intoxicated defendant suffering forfeiture of a vehicle worth $ 5000 was not so &quot;grossly disproportionate&quot; as to run afoul of the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; the court held the admission of evidence that defendant refused to perform the final two field sobriety tests and the blood alcohol evidence did not require reversal. The sentence of forfeiting his vehicle, combined with a fine was not unconstitutional. There was no plain error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his driver's license was revoked or suspended, and with failing to appear for a hearing, trial, or other court appearance.
