</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida) convicted defendant, upon a plea of no contest, under two statutes enacted to protect the public from crimes committed by criminal gangs, the gang recruitment provision, &sect; 874.05(1), Fla. Stat. (2009), and the electronic communication regulation, &sect; 874.11, Fla. Stat. (2009). Defendant appealed, challenging the constitutionality of each statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">To prove that defendant violated the statutes, the State intended to introduce a DVD containing YouTube videos of defendant. The gang recruitment provision was enacted to protect the public from speech and conduct used to encourage gang membership, where a condition of membership or continued membership was the commission of any crime. The statute passed constitutional muster under U.S. Const. amend. I, and Art. I, &sect; 4, Fla. Const., did not violate the Due Process Clause of Art. I, &sect; 9, Fla. Const., and was not void for vagueness under U.S. Const. amend. V, as applied to defendant. The electronic communication regulation, on the other hand, proscribed the use of electronic communication to intimidate or harass others, or to advertise one's presence in the community, for the purpose of benefiting, promoting, or furthering the interests of a criminal gang. Because &sect; 874.11, Fla. Stat., substantially tread upon protected speech and expressive conduct, associational activity, and other innocent acts, and could not have been suitably narrowed to comport with federal and state constitutional requirements, the court was constrained to reverse the conviction and sentence on that count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence on the gang recruitment count, but reversed the conviction and sentence on the electronic communications count.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed an order by the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County, (Florida) that granted defendant's motion to dismiss based on the unconstitutionality of &sect; 316.075, Fla. Stat. (2010).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When a law enforcement officer observed defendant proceed through a red light, the officer issued a citation for a violation of &sect; 316.075. The trial court found that continued enforcement of &sect; 316.0083, Fla. Stat. (2010) rendered &sect; 316.075&nbsp;unconstitutional by treating citizens differently, depending upon whether the red light violation was caught by law enforcement or a red light camera. The appellate court found, inter alia, that because points were &quot;personal,&quot; it would not be reasonable for the legislature to impose them based on a red light violation captured by a camera as there was no law enforcement officer present to determine who actually operated the vehicle. There was, therefore, a rational basis for the differing penalties between the two statutory provisions based on whether or not an officer observed the violation. Consequently, &sect; 316.075 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of either the United States or Florida Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services challenged an order of the Circuit Courts for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), which ordered the issuance of a writ of execution on the judgment plaintiff landowners recovered against it. The landowners challenged an order of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County, which precluded execution and found &sect; 11.066, Fla. Stat. (2000) constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners filed class actions against the Department, alleging inverse condemnation. In the Palm Beach County action, the landowners contended that &sect; 11.066 had to be interpreted in light of a property owner's right to receive full and just compensation for a taking and that &sect; 74.091, Fla. Stat. (2000), was an exception to the prohibition of the execution of judgments against the State and its agencies in takings cases. The court of appeal held that the provisions of chapter 74 of the Florida Statutes applied only to traditional, state-initiated eminent domain actions. Neither the Broward nor Palm Beach classes were a petitioner enumerated in &sect; 74.011. The landowners in both classes argued that &sect; 11.066(3) and (4), were unconstitutional as applied to their cases because it limited their ability to secure the full payment to which they are entitled. Because the Broward County class had not yet availed itself of the appropriation process contemplated by &sect; 11.066, its as-applied constitutional challenge to the statute was not ripe for review. The legislature could appropriate the full amounts of the awards in a statute directed at some form of payment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeal reversed the portion of the Palm Beach County order allowing execution against the Department and remanded the case to that  circuit courts for further proceedings. It also reversed that portion of the Broward County order upholding the constitutionality of the statute as applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees, the police association and three individuals, filed a complaint against appellee, the Secretary of the Department of Corrections (DOC), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) held that the privatization of prisons directive in the General Appropriations Act, ch. 2011-69, &sect; 4, at 1215-17, Laws of Fla., violated Art. III, &sect;&sect; 6 and 12, Fla. Const. Appellant Attorney General sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court enjoined the DOC from taking any further steps to implement proviso language understood as intended to require the DOC to issue a request for proposals to privative 29 correctional facilities in the region. The Secretary of the DOC, against whom the final declaratory and injunctive judgment was actually entered, did not appeal. Instead, the Attorney General, who did not participate as a party in her own right, sought to overturn the judgment. However, like any other non-party in the trial court, the Attorney General lacked standing to initiate the appeal on her own. The Attorney General filed a notice of appeal of the trial court's order, not on behalf of any party to the proceedings below, but in her capacity as the Attorney General of the State of Florida and pursuant to her putative authority under &sect; 16.01(4), Fla. Stat. Not having moved to intervene as a party below, the Attorney General lacked authority to initiate an appeal. The appellate court, therefore, was without jurisdiction to review the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with possession of cocaine, evidence tampering, possession of marijuana, and obstruction of a law enforcement officer without violence. The Circuit Court for Manatee County (Florida) granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized during a traffic stop made pursuant to &sect; 316.3045(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2010). The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the hearing on an initial motion, and after the appellate court issued an opinion in a separate case, defendant filed an amended motion arguing that the traffic stop was illegal as a result of what he alleged was the appellate court's ruling that &sect; 316.3045 was unconstitutional. The trial court's order was based on that separate opinion. The State argued that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied. Defendant argued that the officer could not have been acting in good faith because the appellate court had previously determined that the &quot;plainly audible&quot; standard of a comparable county noise ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Although the appellate court recognized that the &quot;plainly audible&quot; standard violated the First Amendment, the officer in this case was acting in good faith. At the time of the stop a reasonable officer would not have known that &sect; 316.3045 was unconstitutional because the opinion so holding did not issue until after the stop in question in this case. The officer acted in an objectively reasonable manner based on existing precedent and the accepted status of the law from which his authority extended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant father challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida), which denied his petition to modify a domesticated State of Virginia judgment allowing appellee maternal grandmother visitation rights with his child. The father sought to terminate the visitation rights the Virginia court had awarded the grandmother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Virginia court rendered a consent judgment giving the grandmother visitation rights. The supreme court held that the trial court erred in denying the father's petition to modify the domesticated Virginia judgment. The trial court was bound to give the Virginia judgment full faith and credit by reason of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. The Virginia court possessed subject matter and personal jurisdiction under its codification of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Va. Code. Ann. &sect;&sect; 20-146.1 to 20-146.38 (2008). The father showed that there had been a substantial and material change in circumstances since entry of the Virginia judgment that was not reasonably contemplated, i.e., his remarriage, the stepparent adoption, and the grandmother's interference with his parental decision-making. The public policy of Florida subordinated grandparent visitation rights to the superior rights of a parent. The grandmother had virtually no rights as a grandparent because of the privacy right protection enshrined in Art. I, &sect; 23, Fla. Const. The father's preference was controlling on whether to allow the grandmother visitation with his child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court reversed the judgment reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to grant the father's petition to modify the domesticated judgment to terminate grandparent visitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner insurance company sought review of the order of the Circuit Court for Pasco County (Fla.) that ruled that &sect; 627.7074. Fla. Stat. (2010) was unconstitutional and prohibited the company from conducting any further action on a neutral evaluation under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insured filed a breach of contract action against the company alleging the company failed to provide coverage and pay for damages sustained as a result of sinkhole activity on their property. The company filed an answer and affirmative defenses and moved to stay the proceedings so that it could conduct a neutral evaluation under &sect; 627.7074 as an alternative procedure to resolve the disputed claim. After conducting a hearing on the parties' motions, the circuit court entered an order denying the company's motion to stay and granted the insured's' motion for a protective order. The appellate court found that the legislature explicitly enacted the neutral evaluation process under &sect; 627.7074 to efficiently resolve sinkhole disputes, in order to accelerate the timeline by which sinkhole activity is mitigated, where verified at the property, and to minimize, if not avoid, the costs associated with unnecessary litigation. If a sinkhole dispute was allowed to proceed in the circuit court without a stay during the neutral evaluation, or by failing to hold any neutral evaluation, then the legislative purpose of the statute would not be accomplished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 893.13, Fla. Stat. (2003) prohibited the unauthorized possession, purchase, sale, manufacture, or delivery of a controlled substance; and the possession with intent to purchase, sell, manufacture, or deliver a controlled substance. Under &sect; 893.101, Fla. Stat., knowledge of the nature of the substance was not an element of the offense, but rather an affirmative defense that could be raised by the defendant. The appellate court issued its opinion in Taylor v. State rejecting a facial constitutional challenge to &sect; 893.13, Fla. Stat., as amended by &sect; 893.101, Fla. Stat. In reversing the order under review, the appellate court rejected the trial court's contention that the issues raised in the instant cases were not previously raised and decided by the appellate court and rejected the trial court's conclusion that it was bound by a federal trial court's decision. If the appellate court concluded in Taylor that &sect; 893.13, as amended by &sect; 893.101, did not violate Florida constitutional due process guarantees, then it necessarily followed that the amended statute also passed federal constitutional due process muster. Section 893.13 did not create strict liability crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida), arguing that a declaratory decision correctly required a referendum by the voters approving or disapproving a collective bargaining agreement between the city and appellee union. The court of appeal approved and adopted as its own the circuit court's decision in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city argued that pursuant to &sect; 166.021, Fla. Stat., it was required to submit the bargained for amendments to the pension plan, and, hence, its municipal charter, to the electors of the city. Therefore, it contended that the amendments had to be ratified by referendum by the electors before they cold become effective. The circuit court held that the referendum requirement of &sect; 166.021(4), with respect to the collective bargained pension agreement, was violative of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, and in accordance with &sect; 447.309(3), Fla. Stat., no referendum was necessary for the city to ratify the subject pension agreement. Collective bargaining could only be meaningful and effective if the bargaining official for the public employer represents the view of the legislative body. The chief executive officer of a public employer could not possibly meet with the thousands of electors who would vote in a referendum. The referendum requirement of &sect; 166.021(4), as the city sought to apply it to the collectively bargained pension agreement, was violative of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeal ruled that the result of its adoption of the circuit court's decision and opinion was the reversal of the declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State, following the United States Supreme Court's decision in Graham, filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence because defendant had received multiple life sentences for non-homicide offenses committed when he was 17. The Circuit Court for Escambia County (Florida) resentenced defendant to an aggregate of 80 years in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant committed the crimes in 1985. He asserted that his sentence was the functional equivalent of a sentence of life without the possibility of parole in that it did not provide him with a meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. Therefore, he argued, under Graham, the sentence violated the U.S. Const. amend. VIII prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The court rejected this argument. Under the 1985 statutes that applied to him, defendant had the opportunity to earn both basic gain time under &sect; 944.275(4)(a), Fla. Stat. (1985) and incentive gain time under &sect; 944.275(4)(b). He thus was eligible to serve a sentence significantly less than the 63 years he would serve if only basic gain time were applied. Accordingly, defendant had been afforded the requisite meaningful opportunity to obtain release based upon demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation mandated by Graham.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, St. Lucie County (Florida) extended defendant's probation two years based on its finding that defendant willfully and substantially violated the terms of her probation by failing to prove inability to pay restitution, costs of supervision, and court costs by clear and convincing evidence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court stated that the Florida Supreme Court had held that while it was constitutional to place the burden on a probationer to prove inability to pay, the aspect of &sect; 948.06(5), Fla. Stat. that required the probationer to prove inability to pay by the heightened standard of clear and convincing evidence was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Art. I, &sect; 11, Fla. Const. In light of the supreme court's recent interpretation of the statute, it was clear that the trial court erroneously shifted the burden of proof to defendant to prove inability to pay by clear and convincing evidence. Because the trial court found that defendant had proven that she did not have the present resources to pay restitution, costs of supervision, and court costs by a preponderance of the evidence, the court reversed the order extending defendant's probation by two years. It remanded the case for entry of a new order, nunc pro tunc to the original order, finding that there was no willful violation of probation. Therefore, because the extension of probation was erroneous, any additional costs associated with the extension of probation were also erroneously imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's order extending defendant's probation. It remanded the case for entry of a new order, nunc pro tunc to the original order, finding that there was no willful violation of probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant defendant appealed the judgment and sentenced imposed by the Circuit Court for Lee County (Fla.) after she pled no contest to the reduced charge of attempted violation of the prohibition against a felon working for a bail bond agent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that she lacked the mens rea to have violated &sect; 648.44(8)(a), Fla. Stat. (2009) because she had no idea that obtaining otherwise legal clerical work became a felony if her employer was a bail bond agent. Defendant argued that the statute, as it applied to a person who violated &sect; 648.44(8)(a) by accepting a position with a bail bond agency, implicitly required that a knowledge element be read into it and that the trial court erred in denying her motion to dismiss because the state failed to allege that she knowingly violated the statute. The appellate court found that a mens rea element should be read into the statute as it applied to a person who accepted an employment position with a bail bond agency. Absent a knowledge element for the employee, this statute simply criminalized what was otherwise innocent conduct, i.e., working at a clerical job.</SPAN></P>

A hearing officer refused to consider the driver's challenge to the lawfulness of her stop pursuant to &sect; 322.2615(7)(a), Fla. Stat. (2010). Thereafter, the criminal charges against the driver were dropped before she had the opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of her stop. The appellate court found, inter alia, that in order to avoid subjecting the driver to a miscarriage of justice or unconstitutional treatment, the lawfulness of her stop, which had never been determined, had to be reviewed and decided.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County, (Florida) of second degree murder and possession of a weapon on school grounds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to disallow the State of Florida's peremptory strike of a prospective juror. The juror was an African-American woman. Defendant was African-American, and the victim was white. The state exercised five peremptory challenges against African-Americans. The juror did not answer several questions on the jury questionnaire, and in response to the question about the case's primary issue -- the insanity defense -- she indicated that she did not understand the word &quot;insanity.&quot; When the State asked the juror if she was having any trouble in understanding, she responded &quot;I stand -- I stand -- understand some of it. Not a lot.&quot; On appeal, the court found that the trial court's lack of articulation of its thought process on the issue of pretext was not clearly erroneous or an abuse of discretion. Further, the trial court's finding that the State's race-neutral reason was genuine, and not a pretext was not clearly erroneous or an abuse of discretion. Finally, defendant, as the opponent of the strike, did not meet her burden to demonstrate that the State's race-neutral reason for striking the juror was not genuine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective, that his life sentence was cruel and unusual, and that he should be entitled to amend his motion. The appellate court found, inter alia, that defendant did not claim that he was in fact insane at the time of the murder for which he was convicted, or that he was incompetent to stand trial. Objection to the admission of his own exculpatory statement would have been fruitless because the statement was admissible as an admission of a party opponent. Defendant did not show that any tactic by counsel that would have produced a different result at trial. Additionally, none of his claims survived the prejudice prong of the Strickland analysis. Defendant's life sentence was mandated by the Prison Releasee Reoffender Act. Finally, his initial brief failed to establish that his claims could be amended in good faith to become legally sufficient, or how it could be done. Accordingly, he was not entitled to a third motion for postconviction relief under Rule 3.850.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Department of Children and Family Services (DCF) sought to terminate the parental rights of appellee parents to their twins under &sect; 39.806(1)(f) and (g), Fla. Stat. (2009). The Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) denied DCF's petition and placed the children in the permanent guardianship of their grandparents. The DCF and appellant Guardian ad Litem Program challenged the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the trial court properly determined that there was a nexus between the abuse of one child and the substantial risk of significant harm to the other. The cases did not limit the nexus test to circumstances where a parent had a mental or emotional condition that would continue, such as mental illness, drug addiction, or pedophilia. The trial court properly focused on the egregious abuse of one child and considered the applicability of the circumstances to the second child based on the temporal proximity of the abuse, the second child's status as a twin, and the parents' continued prioritization of each other over the safety and well-being of the first child. Next, the trial court misapplied the manifest best interests and least restrictive means tests by basing its decision not to terminate solely on the availability of the alternative placement. Section 39.810(1), Fla. Stat., prohibited giving the availability of a nonadoptive placement greater consideration than any other best interest factor. Finally, under &sect; 39.811, Fla. Stat., the trial court was precluded from sua sponte placing the children into a permanent guardianship at this stage in the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's orders. It remanded the case with directions for the trial court to reconsider the DCF's termination petition by reapplying the manifest best interest and least restrictive means tests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner motorist sought a writ of certiorari to review an order of the Circuit Court for the Twentieth Judicial Circuit for Lee County (Florida) affirming an administrative hearing officer's decision that sustained the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles' suspension of the motorist's license based on the motorist's refusal to submit to a breath test upon an arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A sheriff's deputy stopped the motorist for allegedly driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage. In the encounter, the motorist refused to engage in a field sobriety test or a breath test. The deputy arrested him for DUI, in violation of &sect; 316.193, Fla. Stat. (2010), and for refusing to take the breath test, in violation of &sect; 316.1939, Fla. Stat. Despite the motorist's insistence that the suspension be invalidated due to the unlawfulness of his arrest, the hearing officer made no such finding. The circuit court erred in concluding that the issue of the lawfulness of the arrest was outside the reviewing powers of the hearing officer and could be have been addressed by either the administrative body or any reviewing court. While the petition for writ of certiorari was pending in the appellate court, the supreme court rendered an opinion resolving a conflict between McLaughlin v. Department of Highway Safety &amp; Motor Vehicles, 2 So. 3d 988 (Fla. 2d DCA 2008) and Florida Department of Highway Safety &amp; Motor Vehicles v. Hernandez, 74 So. 3d 1070 (Fla. 2011) in the motorist's favor. The suspension was only valid if the arrest was lawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the petition for writ of certiorari and remanded the case to the circuit court to determine the mechanism by which the lawfulness of the motorist's arrest may be decided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner newspaper editor moved to intervene to oppose the State's motion to seal transcripts, which the trial court (Florida) granted. Specifically, the records sought were transcripts of tape recordings and tape recordings that were claimed by respondents, the State of Florida and defendant in a criminal trial, to be recordings of a defense attorney and a forensic psychologist that were made without consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court previously affirmed the trial court's rulings on the illegality and admissibility of the tape recordings at issue, the trial court's rulings on whether the recordings were required to be confidential pursuant to chapter 934, Fla. Stat., and the trial court's rulings on whether there was an expectation of privacy. Because the editor was an intervenor whose interest was subordinate, and because the editor, as an intervenor, was bound by the record made at the time he intervened, the doctrine of law of the case applied to him. Because the identical legal arguments asserted in the petition were raised and rejected in prior appeals, the doctrine of law of the case governed and requires denial of the petition. Further the mandate had issued on the appellate court's decision affirming the order that the editor sought to reverse. Moreover, the term of court expired without a recall of that mandate. The trial court's order sealing the unlawfully recorded oral communications and the transcripts was neither unconstitutional nor a denial of public access pursuant to &sect; 934.03, Fla. Stat.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court's prior order denying the petition for review of order sealing judicial record was withdrawn. and a new order was substituted in its place. The petition was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee insured filed suit against appellant insurer under a homeowner's policy. The Circuit Court for Pasco County (Florida) granted summary judgment to the insured on her breach of contract claim. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lawsuit arose from a sinkhole claim on which the insurer paid its policy limits with interest. The court stated that it was at a loss to determine from the record what act the trial court believed constituted a breach of contract. The simple fact that the insurer initially sent a letter to its insured declining coverage based on the statutory sinkhole report and later decided unilaterally to pay the full policy limits during the neutral evaluation did not prove a breach of contract in this context. As for the trial court's finding that the insurer's later payment of the claim was in effect a &quot;confession of judgment,&quot; the confession of judgment rule was intended to penalize insurance companies for wrongfully causing an insured to resort to litigation. It was not apparent here that the insured was ever required to &quot;resort&quot; to litigation. She appeared to have opted to pursue litigation without ever attempting to discuss the disagreement with the insurer. Certainly, as an issue for summary judgment, the record did not establish an undisputed factual basis to conclude that the insurer confessed judgment to the initial complaint when it decided to pay this claim in full.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's decision. It remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff decedent's estate, but the appellate court reversed the judgment entered on the verdict in a previous appeal by defendant blood bank. The proceeding on remand was concluded in the Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida) by an order dismissing the complaint as the estate had failed to serve notice of the suit under the medical malpractice statute, &sect; 776.220, Fla. Stat. The estate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The estate filed suit against the blood bank seeking damages for the injuries a patient sustained as a result of the blood bank's negligence in failing to ensure the safety of the blood he had received. The patient subsequently died. The complaint was amended. The allegations of negligence were the same as those in the original complaint. The doctrine of the law of the case did not foreclose consideration of the retroactive applicability issue because that issue had not been presented or decided on appeal. The estate had no reason to make a claim that the statute could not be applied retroactively, because the trial judge had determined that it did not apply to them in any event. The appellate court did not agree that the retroactivity argument was barred from further consideration because it was raised for the first time in a motion for rehearing. The statutory amendment including blood banks within the class of health care providers that were protected by the presuit screening requirements could not be applied retroactively as the amendment alters the substantive rights of the parties in that it adds a condition that can operate to bar a cause of action entirely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was reversed. The matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) denied appellant smoker's motions for directed verdict and new trial regarding appellee tobacco companies' affirmative defense that the smoker's tort action was barred by the statute of limitations under &sect; 95.11(3), Fla. Stat. (1994). The smoker appealed. The companies cross appealed the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury regarding the statute of repose, &sect; 95.031(2)(a), Fla. Stat. (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The action was filed pursuant to Engle v. Liggett Group, Inc., 945 So. 2d 1246 (Fla. 2006). The trial court correctly granted preclusive effect to certain findings by the Florida Supreme Court in Engle. However, it erred in failing to grant the smoker's motion for directed verdict on the statute of limitations issue because there was no competent evidence in the record that the accumulated effects of the substance had manifested in a way which supplied the smoker with some evidence of the causal relationship to the manufactured product before the undisputed limitations bar date. According to Engle, the critical event was not when an illness was actually diagnosed by a physician, but when the disease or condition manifested itself. This issue was not whether the smoker had a creeping, stealthy disease of emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease before the limitations bar date, but whether she knew, or reasonably should have known, enough to permit her to commence a non-frivolous tort lawsuit against the companies on the basis of those physical, observable, patent symptoms and effects before the date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment, and remanded the matter with instructions to grant the smoker a directed verdict on the statute of limitations issue, and for further proceedings in accordance with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated cases, appellants city and agency sued appellee supervisor, and others, seeking a determination that a proposed charter amendment and question were unconstitutional and invalid. The Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), allowed the charter question to appear on the general election ballot to ask voters whether the city's charter should be amended. The city and the agency appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city and the agency claimed that the ballot language was ambiguous in violation of &sect; 101.161(1), Fla. Stat. However, the appellate court found that the ballot summary did not mislead and was not defective. Although it might have been more artfully phrased, the summary informed voters of the amendment's chief purpose. The wording of the charter amendment itself was not a model of clarity, but it was not so ambiguous that its meaning could not have been understood, and the ballot summary provided an explanation of its purpose. The city did not pass a resolution but acceded to the submission of the amendment with the ballot summary to the supervisor of elections. The city was not allowed to complain that its own failure to perform its duty prevented the citizens from voting on the charter amendment proposal. The amendment on the ballot was not one involving a development order or a local comprehensive plan amendment or map amendment, and therefore, &sect; 163.3167, Fla. Stat. was irrelevant. A decision on the issue of the legal status of the property owned by the agency was unnecessary because the trial court held that the entire amendment was not invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury in the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) convicted defendant of sale of cocaine and resisting an officer without violence. The trial court sentenced him to 15 years on the cocaine offense and time served on the resisting offense. The trial court orally pronounced &quot;costs and fines&quot; of $ 1,522, $ 100 for cost of prosecution, $ 100 for &quot;defense litigation fee,&quot; and $ 50 for the public defender application fee. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant did not object to the imposition of the costs and fines at sentencing. He did, however, file a motion pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b)(2) in which he argued that the $ 1,050 fine and $ 52 surcharge reflected in the written judgment and sentence should have been stricken because they were not specifically pronounced at sentencing. The trial court denied that motion. However, the appellate court found that the record did not support the trial court's finding of waiver. Nor was there any merit to the State's argument that the issue was not properly preserved for review. Defendant preserved the issue through his Rule 3.800(b)(2) motion. The fine authorized by &sect; 775.083(1), Fla. Stat. was discretionary and, thus, it was error for the trial court to impose the $ 1,050 fine under this statute without specifically pronouncing the fine at the sentencing hearing. Because this fine was erroneously imposed, the surcharge under &sect; 938.04, Fla. Stat., which was based on the amount of fine, was also improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county expressway authority challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), which awarded appellee landowners attorney's fees in an eminent domain proceeding. The trial court refused to limit attorney's fees awarded to the landowners to those permitted by &sect; 73.092(1), Fla. Stat. (2006), based on a pre-suit offer made by the authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A tenant leased the landowners' property. The landowners did not accept the authority's pre-suit offer to buy their property. The compensation issue was tried before a jury. The landowners filed a motion to recover attorney's fees. The authority sought to limit fees to those permitted by &sect; 73.092(1). The court of appeal held that the landowners' attorney's fees were limited to those permitted by &sect; 73.092(1). No apportionment issues existed in the case that would preclude the trial court from calculating the benefits achieved by the landowners. All of the benefits achieved in the case were attributable to the landowners, and not to the tenant, which settled its claim prior to trial. Moreover, there were no apportionment issues between the landowners, whose ownership interests represented a straight eighty-five to fifteen percent division of the entire fee. That meant that one hundred percent of the benefits achieved were attributable to the landowners, who were represented by the same counsel. The legislature intended to limit fees during the valuation portion of the condemnation proceedings to those derived in achieving benefits on behalf of a landowner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeal reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further consideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court ruled that appellant had violated three of the conditions of his probation.

Looking to the state supreme court's rule of lenity interpretation of what was now &sect; 948.30(1)(g), Fla. Stat. (2011), the appellate court held that Condition 20 was limited to materials relevant to appellant's deviant behavior in the underlying offense. The evidence in the record was insufficient to show a connection between the images appellant had and the deviant behavior at issue in the underlying offense. Remand was required because to was unclear whether the trial court would have revoked appellant's probation and imposed the same sentence based on violations of conditions 9 and 18 alone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed as to the violations of Conditions 9 and 18, reversed as to the violation of Condition 20, and remanded with instructions to the trial court that it determine whether appellant's probation would have been revoked and the same sentence imposed based solely on the violations of Conditions 9 and 18.</SPAN></P>

On remand, respondent dependent child filed the subject interrogatories in discovery related to a further motion seeking to have the statue declared unconstitutional. With subparts, there were over 500 interrogatories. Petitioner argued that the juvenile rules did not allow for the use of interrogatories in pendency proceedings. The appellate court agreed. While Fla. R. Juv. P. 8.245 allowed for some forms of discovery, it did not allow for the use of interrogatories except in circumstances not present in the instant matter. Because no rule authorized their use, there was also no rule regulating the use of interrogatories. To refuse to disallow the use of interrogatories by respondent was a material departure from the essential requirements of law.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the state failed to present sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that defendant's failure to make the $10,000 payment was willful. Defendant testified that she had spent all of the fraudulently-obtained money on food, gas, clothing, transportation, and rent. The state did not present any evidence that defendant held or had access to any of the money that she had stolen, or the assets that she had purchased, or that these could not have been dissipated. The burden placed on the state was hard because the facts were peculiarly within the knowledge of defendant, but the state would have to expend its resources to discover the truth if it wished to show that defendant had income or retained assets that should be restored to the victims before her probation could be violated based on her failure to pay restitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the earlier award, the JCC rendered an order on the employer/carrier's motion to tax costs, directing the claimant to reimburse the employer/carrier costs totaling $ 7,162. In the hearing on the motion on appeal, the claimant testified he had not worked for over three years, was homeless, and did not have the ability to pay the taxed costs. The JCC found that the claimant was indigent, unemployed, and homeless. Further, the JCC found that the claimant was not willfully refusing to comply with the prior order taxing costs. Nevertheless, the JCC exercised his discretion under &sect; 440.24(4), Fla. Stat. and granted the motion to dismiss until the claimant was able to pay the outstanding cost judgment, and dismissed the pending petitions. The appellate court found that this was error. A JCC who implemented &sect; 440.24(4), Fla. Stat. had to specifically find that the offending party's conduct was willful, deliberate or contumacious.</SPAN></P>

The statute did not allow other outgoing calls by the 911 dispatcher to be recorded without the consent of the person being called, even if the outgoing call was in reference to or relates to an incoming 911 call. The appellate court also rejected the State's &quot;tipsy coachman&quot; argument that the recording in the case was lawful because the communication captured on the recording was an oral communication between defendant and the victims in which defendant had no expectation of privacy.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court denied the motion, and the appellate court affirmed, stating that the property owner's complaint for inverse condemnation invoked the sword-wielder exception to the county's home venue privilege. The facts alleged in the complaint, which remained to be proven, were that the county had appropriated the property owner's property without paying her any compensation. The property owner was not required to prove in an inverse condemnation action brought after the condemning authority had taken her property without due process that such taking was for a public purpose. She alleged that the county's activities had caused her property to be permanently flooded. If true, that would have amounted to a taking of her property and the complaint sufficiently alleged a taking of her property without due process of law under in violation of Art. X, &sect; 6, Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pro se appealed his judgment and sentence for sexual battery with a deadly weapon or physical force, kidnapping with intent to commit a felony (with a firearm), robbery, carjacking, burglary of a dwelling, and possession of 20 grams or less of cannabis. He contended that his current sentence constituted a de facto sentence of life without the possibility of parole and that such a sentence met the test of cruel and unusual punishment under prior United States Supreme Court case law. At the time of his offenses, defendant was 17 years old. The appellate court stated that defendant's aggregate term-of-years sentence was not invalid under U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Without any tools to work with, the appellate court was only permitted to apply the previous case law as it was written and the facts in the current case were different from that case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a 15-year-old juvenile, was convicted in the Circuit Court for Sarasota County (Florida) of felony murder; defendant supplied a handgun, but another individual actually committed the murder. He was sentenced to a mandatory sentence of life without possibility of parole. Defendant appealed, arguing that the mandatory sentence was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile was 15 at the time of the crime. The court held that in felony murder cases where the juvenile defendant did not actually commit the murder, the trial court must be permitted to engage in a case-specific analysis to determine whether the sentencing statute is unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, as applied to the particular defendant. The court noted that the juvenile's own conduct and culpability were of a lesser degree than if he himself had intentionally pulled the trigger and killed the victim. Given that life without possibility of parole is the greatest sentence he could receive for a premeditated murder, it was potentially disproportionate that Florida law mandates the same nondiscretionary sentence for a felony murder without any consideration of the circumstances of the offense. Other states, including California, Texas, and Georgia, allowed the trial court discretion to determine whether sentencing a juvenile convicted of felony murder to life in prison without parole is appropriate under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the juvenile's sentence and remanded for resentencing and the exercise of the trial court's discretion to determine whether a sentence of life without possibility of parole would be disproportionate and whether a lesser sentence should be imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city's code of enforcement board found that the owner's nonconforming use of her property violated City of Venice, Fla., Code of Ordinances, &sect;&sect; 86-81(d), 86-151. The owner appealed to the circuit court. The court of appeal held that the circuit court departed from the essential requirements of law in determining that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied. Limited by the record established at the hearing before the board, the circuit court was hindered in its ability to engage in any meaningful analysis of the value of the property before and after the enactment of the ordinance. In focusing on the owner's denied expectations for the use of her property, the circuit court failed to recognize record evidence that the property had continued value. The circuit court focused on the owner's loss of the potential rentals available before the enactment of the ordinance but did not weigh that loss with the property's value based on the residual uses after the enactment. By failing to weigh the before and after values of the property, the circuit court did not determine the economic impact of the ordinance on the owner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeal granted the petition, quashed the order of the circuit court, and reinstated the order of the Board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner homeowners sought certiorari review of an order of the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), which denied their motion to lift a stay of proceedings in their breach of contract suit against respondent insurer pending completion of a neutral evaluation under &sect; 627.7074(11), Fla. Stat. (2010). Alternatively, the homeowners sought a writ of mandamus declaring the mandatory stay provision of &sect; 627.7074(11)&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The homeowners filed a sinkhole claim with the insurer. Section 627.7074 and the homeowners' insurance policy contemplated no litigation during the neutral evaluation process. The court of appeal held that the homeowners showed no irreparable harm. The insurance policy provided for neutral evaluation. Thus, the homeowners contractually waived immediate access to the courts. The homeowners had a pending lawsuit and could continue with it upon completion of the neutral evaluation. At most, the evaluation process delayed litigation to promote an alternative method of resolution. Delay or inconvenience was insufficient to invoke certiorari review. The stay provision was sufficiently intertwined with substantive provisions of the statute so that it was not an unconstitutional violation of separation of powers under art. V, &sect; 2(a), Fla. Const, and there was no unconstitutional usurpation of the Florida Supreme Court's rulemaking authority. The statute reflected a legislative intent to encourage early resolution of a sinkhole claim where the parties disagreed on valuation. The automatic stay and the other provisions of the statute combined to facilitate that intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeal dismissed the petition for writ of certiorari and denied the petition for writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant biological mother sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee birth mother in an action involving whether two women involving in a lesbian relationship shared parental rights to a child born out of that relationship.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue to resolve was whether two women involved in a lesbian relationship for several years shared parental rights and responsibilities to a child born out of that relationship. The biological mother appealed a grant of summary judgment in favor of the birth mother and the appellate court reversed and remanded, concluding that both parties had parental rights to the child. The biological mother was not a donor under the definition set out in &sect; 742.14, Fla. Stat. (2009), because she always intended to be a mother to the child born from her ova and was a mother to the child for several years after its birth. That interpretation of the statute violated the biological mother's rights. The appellate court certified the following to the supreme court: Did the application of &sect; 742.14, Fla. Stat. (2009) to deprive parental rights to a lesbian woman who provided her ova to her lesbian partner so both women could have a child to raise together as equal parental partners, and who did parent the child for several years after its birth, render the statute unconstitutional under the Equal Protection and Privacy clauses of the Federal and State Constitutional protection and privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and remanded to the trial court to determine issues of custody, visitation, and child support based on the best interests of the child. The appellate court further certified a question to the supreme court regarding the application of &sect; 742.14, Fla. Stat (2009).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for possession of a controlled substance in violation of &sect; 893.13(6)(a), Fla. Stat. (2010). The Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida) sentenced him to 27.3 months in prison. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the trial court correctly imposed a $ 100 fee for costs of prosecution, pursuant to &sect; 938.27(8), Fla. Stat. (2010). However, a $ 400 public defender fee was erroneously imposed because the trial court failed to make factual findings warranting the imposition of the additional $ 300 as required by &sect; 938.29, Fla. Stat. (2010). The court held that &sect; 893.13, Fla. Stat. (2010) remained constitutional, rejecting an opinion of a federal district court that the statute created a strict liability offense by eliminating all mens rea as an element of the offense. The State was still required to prove defendant's guilty knowledge of the presence of the drug; however, pursuant to &sect; 893.101, Fla. Stat., the State was not required to prove defendant's knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance unless defendant raised that lack of knowledge as an affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the case to the trial court to reduce the public defender fee to the statutorily required $ 100 or to hold a hearing allowing defendant to object to the additional fee imposed. The constitutionality of &sect; 938.13 was upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury in the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida) convicted defendant of first degree felony murder with burglary, &sect; 810.02, Fla. Stat. (2007), being the supporting felony, and shooting or throwing deadly missiles. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Evidence showed that defendant and his brothers entered the fenced yard of a house, and shot guns into the house, killing an eight-year-old girl. The shooting was in retaliation for an earlier altercation between defendant's brother and a resident of the house. Defendant argued that &sect; 810.02 was vague and unconstitutional as applied to him. However, the appellate court held that defendant failed to preserve this claim for review. The yard of the house had a chain link fence around it, with an opening in front for the driveway. For purposes of burglary, an enclosure did not need to be continuous, and an ungated opening for ingress and egress did not preclude a determination that the yard was included in the curtilage. The fencing around the yard here satisfied the enclosure requirement. The trial court did not err in limiting cross-examination of a prosecution witness about crimes the State may not have charged him with in return for his testimony. Defense counsel admitted the questioning was intended to reveal criminal conduct by the witness for which he was not charged, even though the witness only testified to negotiating his way out of murder and drug trafficking charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While the jurisdiction of the court below to grant declaratory relief required that the court deny the petition for writ of prohibition, the court was uncertain as to whether, and did not decide that, the trial court had any ability to grant relief beyond that point.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles sought certiorari review of an order of the Circuit Court for Orange County, Florida, which reinstated the driving privileges of respondent driver. Her driving privileges were suspended because after she failed a field sobriety test, she refused to submit to a test of either her breath alcohol or blood alcohol after being requested to do so by a law enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It was the second time the driver had refused such a test. The court held that the circuit court applied the incorrect law because its analysis reflected that it applied the probable cause standard to the initial traffic stop, rather than the reasonable suspicion standard, despite its ambiguous conclusion in the order granting the driver's petition. In addition, the circuit court improperly held that the two informants were anonymous tipsters and that their information had to be corroborated before it could justify a traffic stop. The informants were clearly not anonymous, as the police were later able to contact them and get their written statements. The arresting officers had a founded suspicion to stop the driver. It appeared, therefore, that the circuit court erred in failing to impute the knowledge of the police dispatcher to the officers, and in failing to conclude that the officers acted upon a founded suspicion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the State's petition and quashed the decision of the circuit court that reinstated the driver's driving privileges.</SPAN></P>

Stat. (2007), and ch. 2007-72, &sect; 2, at 156, Laws of Fla. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the Florida Legislature. The citizens and taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens and taxpayers, who had various roles and interests in the state university system, challenged statutes that restricted the universities' expenditure of tuition and fees and conditioned the appropriation of funds to each university upon compliance with the tuition and fee policies established by the Florida Legislature. The citizens and taxpayers contended that the challenged statutes were unconstitutional because they contravened the Florida Board of Governors' exclusive authority under Art. IX, &sect; 7(d), Fla. Const., to establish and expend tuition and fees. On appeal, the court found that Art. IX, &sect; 7(d), Fla. Const., did not grant the Board authority to set and appropriate tuition and fees; rather, as it was prior to the adoption of Amendment 11, that power was vested exclusively in the Legislature under Art. VII, &sect;&sect; 1(c) and 1(d), Fla. Const. Accordingly, because the challenged statutes did not contravene the Board's authority under Art. IX, &sect; 7(d), Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant holders of gambling permits sued appellee association, and others, seeking a declaratory judgment that the statutory amendment of ch. 09-170, &sect; 19, Laws of Fla. was unconstitutional because it conflicted with art. X, &sect; 23, Fla. Const. The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) denied the holders' summary judgment motion and granted the association's summary judgment motion. The holders appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The holders argued that the legislature's 2009 amendment to &sect; 551.102(4), Fla. Stat. found in ch. 09-170, &sect; 19, Laws of Fla., which expanded the scope of the entities authorized to conduct slot machine gaming in Florida, was unconstitutional because conflicted with art. X, &sect; 23, Fla. Const., which authorized slot machine gaming in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties if approved by county-wide referendum. The trial court reasoned that nothing in art. X, &sect; 23, Fla. Const. impinged upon the legislature's ability to regulate gambling in Florida. The appellate court rejected the holders' contention that the purpose of art. X, &sect; 23, Fla. Const., was to limit slot machine gaming in Florida to certain facilities in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. The legislature had broad discretion in regulating and controlling pari-mutual wagering and gambling under its police powers. Art. X, &sect; 23, Fla. Const. provided no indication that the voters intended to forever prohibit the legislature from exercising its authority to expand slot machine gaming beyond those facilities in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties meeting the specified criteria. Ch. 09-170, &sect; 19, Laws of Fla. was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant former wife sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), which granted appellee insurer's motion for summary judgment and denied the former wife's motion in her counterclaim for breach of contract. The insurer had filed an amended complaint, naming the former wife and sister as defendants, asking the court to determine who was entitled to the life insurance proceeds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeal stemmed from competing claims between the decedent's former wife and the decedent's sister to the proceeds of a life insurance policy issued by the insurer. After the insurer paid the proceeds to the sister and the decedent's daughters, the former wife filed a written claim with the insurer, which it denied. The insurer asked the court to determine who was entitled to the proceeds. The former wife filed a counterclaim for breach of contract and motion for summary judgment, which was denied. The insurer's motion for summary judgment was granted. The appellate court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the insurer, stating that the statutory language in &sect; 627.423, Fla. Stat. (2004) that payment must be in accordance with the terms of the policy or contract required that a change-of-owner or change-of beneficiary request must be in strict compliance with the terms of the policy. The factual inconsistency between unwritten policies and written forms approved for use by the insurer could be resolved only by a trier of fact, and not by a judge on a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the denial of the former wife's motion for summary judgment and reversed the granting of the insurer's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Preserving his right to appeal the Polk County, Florida, Circuit Court's denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment, defendant pled no contest to 10 counts of possession of child pornography, in violation of &sect;&sect; 775.0847, 827.071(5), Fla. Stat. (2007). He then appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a Sunday school teacher, photographed many children in innocent poses. He cut the children's heads from some of his photos and pasted them to photos of nude or partially nude adult women, some of whom were depicted engaging in sexual activity. The appellate court held that the seven photos depicting the lewd exhibition of an adult female's genitals with a child's head superimposed on an adult female body clearly did not constitute child pornography under &sect;&sect; 775.0847(1)(b) or 827.071(5), as they were not images exhibiting a child's genitals or depicting a minor engaged in sexual conduct. Though the other three photos depicted a child's head superimposed on a body of an adult female engaged in sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse, or masturbation--conduct falling within the scope of &sect; 827.071(1)(g)--the sexual conduct was that of an adult, not a child. Accordingly, the appellate court could not conclude that defendant possessed child pornography in violation of &sect;&sect; 775.0847 or 827.071(5).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Escambia County (Florida), which sentenced him to three years in prison for driving while his license was cancelled, suspended, or revoked.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeal held that the trial court erred in imposing a prison sentence, rather than a nonstate prison sanction, in accordance with &sect; 775.082(10) because its findings were unsupported by the record. The record did not support the trial court's finding regarding defendant's potential future dangerousness. Although defendant's history of driving without a license arguably supported the trial court's finding that defendant would continue to do so, the trial court did not make sufficient findings, and the record did not suggest, that imprisonment within the State prison system, rather than the county jail, would better deter defendant from continued unlicensed driving. Nor was there any record support for the trial court's implicit finding that one year of incarceration in the county jail would constitute a significantly lesser deterrent for defendant than three years in State prison. The trial court's additional findings were speculative at best because it did not appear from the record that defendant had a history of vehicle accidents or engaging in high speed chases with law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeal reversed defendant's sentence and remanded for resentencing. On remand, the trial court would sentence defendant to a nonstate prison sanction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Education Practices Commission of the State of Florida entered a Final Order adopting an administrative law judge's recommendation that a teacher's prior conviction for battery warranted permanent revocation of his educator certificate. The teacher appealed the Commission's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teacher was convicted of misdemeanor battery after he pushed a student out of his classroom door with his fingertips. He later was reinstated as a teacher. In 2008, the Legislature amended &sect; 1012.795(1)(n), Fla. Stat., mandating that the Commission permanently revoke the educator certificate of any teacher convicted of misdemeanor battery on a minor, and the teacher's certificate was revoked. The court held that there is nothing directly or indirectly indicating that the Legislature intended the amendment to &sect; 1012.795(1)(n) be applied retroactively. Further, the teacher had a vested property interest in his educator certification, and the Commission's retroactive application of &sect; 1012.795(1)(n) impaired that interest by attaching new legal consequences to events that occurred before its enactment. Due process prohibited ex post facto laws depriving the teacher of property based on conduct occurring before the effective date of the prohibition, pursuant to Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. Therefore, &sect; 1012.795 could not be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Marion County (Florida), which denied his motion to suppress drugs and drug paraphernalia police officers found in his car after they pulled him over for a noise violation pursuant to &sect; 316.3045, Fla. Stat. (2005). He argued that the noise statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and restricted his right of free expression under the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was playing loud music from his car. The officers pulled him over for a noise violation. They discovered that defendant's driver's license was suspended. Defendant was arrested, and his car was searched. The court of appeal held that &sect; 316.3045 was a content-based restriction on free expression, which violated protected First Amendment rights in a manner more intrusive than necessary. The statute discriminated on the basis of content, not noise. While the statute was not unconstitutionally vague since it provided fair notice of the prohibited conduct, it was unconstitutionally overbroad. Although defendant suffered a Fourth Amendment violation, he was not entitled to suppression of the drugs and paraphernalia, and the suppression motion was properly denied. A reasonable officer would not have known that &sect; 316.3045(1)(a) was unconstitutional at the time that defendant's vehicle was stopped for playing excessively loud amplified music. The court of appeal had upheld an earlier version of the statute against a constitutional challenge. Exclusion of the drugs and drug paraphernalia found in defendant's car would have no deterrent effect on future police misconduct whatsoever.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's probation was revoked. The Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida) modified defendant's probation to include electronic monitoring based on &sect; 948.063, Fla. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the &sect; 948.063 requirement that a trial court impose electronic monitoring on certain sex offenders who violate their probation only applied to probationers whose offenses occurred on or after September 1, 2005. Retroactive application of this section to probationers whose offenses were committed before the statute's effective date would violate the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Florida Constitutions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury in the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida) convicted defendant of failure to report a temporary residence in violation of Florida's sexual offender registration statute, in violation of &sect; 943.0435(14), Fla. Stat. (2007). The trial court imposed an enhanced sentence as a habitual violent felony offender (HVFO) to twenty years' incarceration. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to exclude his reasonable hypothesis of innocence, that he visited the apartment complex often to see his girlfriend but did not live there. The appellate court found, however, that this was not a case based solely on circumstantial evidence. There was direct evidence that defendant lived at the complex, namely, the testimony by witnesses who lived at the complex that defendant told them that he lived there. This direct evidence was buttressed by circumstantial evidence. References to his attempt to ask a neighbor out were not irrelevant because the evidence tended to show that defendant lived at the complex. Even if admitting that testimony was error, any error was undoubtedly harmless. Given defendant's HVFO status, the gravity of his triggering crime of failure to report a temporary residence was increased, and thus his sentence was not grossly disproportionate. All of defendant's prior convictions were violent crimes, including two counts of sexual battery, armed kidnapping, armed robbery, and armed burglary. The consecutive ten-year sentences did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was adjudicated guilty of burglary. The Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida) sentenced defendant to 30 years in prison as an habitual felony offender and imposed a public defender's fee $ 2,500 pursuant to &sect; 938.29(5), Fla. Stat. (2009). Defendant filed motions challenging his habitual felony offender sentence and the imposition of the public defender's fee, both of which the trial court denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that &sect; 775.084, Fla. Stat., under which his habitual felony offender sentence was imposed, was unconstitutional under Apprendi, because it authorized the court, rather than the jury, to determine whether a defendant qualified as a habitual felony offender and because it allowed the determination to be based on a preponderance of the evidence, instead of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the appellate court found that the Apprendi challenge to &sect; 775.084 had been repeatedly rejected. Apprendi affected neither the recidivist sentencing scheme under the Prisoner Releasee Reoffender Act nor sentencing as a habitual violent felony offender. However, there was merit to defendant's claim that the trial court erred in imposing a public defender's fee without advising him of the right to contest the amount. The decisions cited by the State rested on considerations unique to the imposition of certain special conditions imposed in a probation order. Defendant's claim that he was denied the statutorily mandated hearing was a sufficient substantive basis on which to challenge the imposition of the public defender's fee in a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b)(2) motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The imposition of the public defender's fee was reversed. Otherwise, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Santa Rosa County (Florida), which convicted and sentenced him for violating &sect; 847.0133, Fla. Stat. (2009), which made it a third-degree felony to knowingly sell, rent, loan, give away, distribute, transmit, or show any obscene material to a minor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction and probationary sentence for violating &sect; 847.0133, Fla. Stat. (2009), but the appellate court affirmed, stating that jurors were correctly instructed to apply contemporary community standards only to the prurient interest and patent offensiveness prongs of the obscenity test. As to the value prong, the circuit court did not refer to community standards in explaining to jurors what to consider in determining whether the movies that defendant showed a minor had literary, artistic, political or scientific value. The trial court's decision not to add the reasonable person standard to the obscenity instruction was neither a constitutional violation nor an abuse of discretion. Additionally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by prohibiting defendant from consuming or possessing alcohol as a special condition of probation since the information in the presentence investigation report negated the third Rodriguez factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee estate sued appellant rehabilitation facility, and others, alleging negligence. Following an earlier appeal, the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) denied the rehabilitation facility's motion to compel arbitration. The rehabilitation facility appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time he entered the rehabilitation facility, the decedent signed admissions-related paperwork which included an arbitration agreement. The estate argued, inter alia, that the arbitration provision was unconscionable and, thus, unenforceable. The appellate court found that the trial court properly considered the unconscionability argument because that alternative argument was presented to the trial court but never decided before the first appeal. However, the arbitration agreement was not shown to be unconscionable. The estate first argued that limits on punitive damages rendered the arbitration agreement substantively unconscionable. However, the agreement did not place limits on punitive damages. The agreement was silent as to punitive damages but provided that the arbitration award was to be consistent with Florida law except as otherwise stated in the agreement. Behan did not apply when the substantive law allowed an award of punitive damages, and the substantive law of Florida allowed punitive damages. Further, the agreement's limitation on discovery and its $ 250,000 cap on noneconomic damages, alone, did not support a finding of substantive unconscionability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his life sentence by the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, St. Lucie County (Florida) for a violation of probation stemming from his conviction on multiple felony charges when he was 14. He argued that the Eighth Amendment prohibited the imposition of a life sentence without the possibility of parole for a crime, other than homicide, committed while he was under the age of 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the age of 14, defendant committed several violent robberies of senior citizens. Defendant entered an open plea of guilty on all charges. The court adjudicated defendant delinquent and committed him to a maximum risk residential commitment program for an indeterminate period of time, followed by juvenile probation. Defendant did not object to the sentence and did not appeal. Shortly after defendant turned 18, he was charged with the kidnapping and false imprisonment of his cousin with the intent to terrorize him. The trial court found defendant had violated his probation. The jury found defendant guilty as charged of kidnapping. The trial court sentenced defendant to life in prison. The appellate court held that defendant was a member of that limited class of people, juvenile offenders who committed non-homicide crimes, protected by the Eighth Amendment. Although he was an adult when he violated his probation, the probationary sentence was imposed for crimes he committed when he was 14. Such a sentence violated the Eighth Amendment and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants lessees sued appellees, a county appraiser and a county tax collector, in the Circuit Court for Escambia County (Florida) for a declaration that assessments of their leaseholds were unlawful.

The appellate court agreed because (1) prior binding precedent held similar lessees were subject to ad valorem taxes on their improvements, and, (2) while there were differences in the circumstances of the prior lessees and the lessees involved in the current litigation, those circumstances were similar enough to cause the doctrine of stare decisis to require a similar result, as no exception to that doctrine applied. It was error for the trial court to grant declaratory injunctive relief barring the tax collector from selling tax certificates regarding property as to which taxes had become delinquent, under &sect;&sect; 196.199(8)(a), 197.432(9), and 199.023(1)(d), Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee personal representative obtained a $ 15.75 million judgment against appellant tobacco company. The tobacco company appealed and obtained a stay of the judgment by posting a $ 5 million bond pursuant to &sect; 569.23(3), Fla. Stat. The Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida) denied the personal representative's motion to determine the sufficiency of the bond. The personal representative sought review of that order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under Fla. R. App. P. 9.310(b)(1), the bond required for a stay would have been about $ 17.6 million. The personal representative argued that &sect; 569.23(3) was an unconstitutional special law under Art. III, &sect; 11(a)(12), Fla. Const. because it applied only to the five tobacco companies that signed an underlying settlement agreement in the Engle progeny cases. However, the appellate court found that the statute was not limited to judgments entered for Engle plaintiffs; it applied in any civil case against a settlement agreement signatory brought by or on behalf of a member of a decertified class action. It was not unreasonable to expect that the settlement agreement signatories, which included the nation's four largest tobacco companies, may have been the subject of other class actions that ended up being decertified. Thus, it was not a special law. Further, Fla. R. App. P. 9.310(a) recognized that general law and the rule itself may have provided different requirements for obtaining a stay, and &sect; 569.23(3) fell within the &quot;except as provided by general law&quot; clause of Rule 9.310(a). The statute did not violate the separation of powers mandate in Art. II, &sect; 3, Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's order denying the personal representative's motion to determine the sufficiency of the bond was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a student. A security guard at a school observed a gun on defendant's person. The court of appeal held that in light of the serious nature of the threat and the location in which it took place, the actions of school authorities were reasonable. Defendant was approached following a tip that he had carried a gun onto campus. School officials could not ignore the possibility that defendant could possess a firearm on school property. Those officials had not only the right, but the responsibility, to look further into the threat. Defendant was first approached in a crowded cafeteria. Investigating in that location would have placed the other students and staff in potential danger. Removing defendant from the location prior to questioning him was the only responsible action that could have been taken. The only reasonable means of investigating the potential of a gun being carried on campus was to separate defendant from the general population and take him to the administrative offices. Any other course of action would have subjected other students and staff to potential harm. Thus, there existed a neutral plan of execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury in the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) convicted defendant of attempted second-degree murder and child abuse. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued the trial court fundamentally erred by giving the standard jury instruction for attempted manslaughter by act. The appellate court agreed. The appellate court certified direct conflict with the Fourth District's decision in Williams v. State, which held that the instruction did not constitute fundamental error. Contrary to defendant's claim, the State presented sufficient evidence regarding the &quot;mental injury&quot; element of the offense of child abuse, &sect; 827.03(1)(b), Fla. Stat. (2008). The offense included any intentional act that could reasonably have been expected to cause mental injury. It was undisputed that the victim's son witnessed his mother being punched by defendant, and when he pleaded with defendant to stop, defendant continued to attack the victim by stabbing her multiple times with a knife. Following the bloody attack, which the son fully witnessed, the son ran out of the house crying and screaming. There was no doubt that the State proved that defendant's intentional act could reasonably have been expected to result in mental injury. The fact that the son's sister testified that the son was presently doing well in school was not dispositive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction and sentence for attempted second-degree murder was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial on that charge. Otherwise, the judgment was affirmed. A conflict was certified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county filed an action against appellee, the owner of a hotel, contending that outdoor advertising signage on the sides of the hotel violated Miami-Dade County, Fla., Code of Ordinances, Ch. 33, &sect;&sect; 33-121.10 and 33-121.12. The county challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida), which denied its motion for preliminary injunctive relief and dismissed its lawsuit with prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeal held that the enactment of the ordinances was a proper exercise of the county's broad home rule and police powers under Art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 2 and 6(e) and (f), Fla. Const., and &sect; 125.01(1)(h), Fla. Stat. (2008). The county was granted the authority, under its broad home rule and police powers, to enact local ordinances, including sign ordinances, which pursuant to &sect; 125.0102, Fla. Stat. (2008), were not preempted by, or inconsistent with, general law. The ordinances were not unconstitutional. There was no evidence that the ordinances were arbitrarily adopted. The enactment of the ordinances for their stated purposes of preventing signage that could endanger public safety, or damage or impair the county's aesthetic qualities, tourism, or the general welfare of its public, Miami-Dade County, Fla., Code of Ordinances, Ch. 33, &sect;&sect; 33-83(a)(1)-(4), were all legitimate governmental concerns supporting their validity under the county's broad home rule and police powers. Nothing was presented by the hotel to demonstrate that the ordinances, as applied to the hotel, caused a unique hardship. The hotel's property had been, and could continue to operate, as a hotel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeal reversed the judgment and remanded the case for entry of a preliminary injunction in favor of the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State charged defendant with oxycodone trafficking under &sect; 893.135(1)(c)1.a., Fla. Stat. (2009), and withholding information from a practitioner under &sect; 893.13(7)(a)8., Fla. Stat. (2009). The Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida) granted defendant's motion to suppress patient contracts and doctors' statement and denied suppression of pharmacy records. The State appealed and defendant cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police office obtained patient contracts, doctors' statement, and pharmacy records without obtaining a subpoena or warrant. On appeal, the State argued that, as to the patient contracts and doctors' statements, defendant's right to privacy was reduced once a detective discovered possible doctor shopping, a criminal act implicating the State's compelling interest in drug abuse prevention and control. The appellate court held that the patient contracts were medical records protected by &sect; 456.057(7)(a), Fla. Stat. (2009), despite the argument that they did not have to do with actual examination and treatment. The doctors' statements were also protected under the doctor-patient privilege. The appellate court concluded that suppression was the proper remedy, because the detective made no good faith effort to comply with the necessary procedures. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the trial court did not err in suppressing the pharmacy records, as &sect; 893.07(4), Fla. Stat. (2009), permitted the detective to obtain those records and &sect; 893.07 did not violate Art. I, &sect; 23, Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of Florida argued that &sect; 316.3045, Fla. Stat., which restricted the volume at which a car stereo system could be played on a public street, did not invite arbitrary enforcement and comported with free speech rights. The State also argued that the statute was constitutional under binding precedent. At issue was the sufficiency of the phrase &quot;plainly audible&quot; in the statute. The reviewing court found that the circuit court afforded the parties due process and did not depart from the essential requirements of the law in finding that the plainly audible standard was too vague and overbroad to pass constitutional scrutiny. Additionally, the statute was a content-based restriction on free expression which violated the First Amendment because &sect; 316.3045(3), Fla. Stat., excepted from its provisions motor vehicles used for business or political purposes, which in the normal course of conducting such business used sound-making devices. Additionally, the State advanced no compelling state interest that rescued the statute from being an unconstitutional suppression of protected speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee cities and counties sued appellant state officials in the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), for a declaratory judgment invalidating ch. 2009-96, Laws of Fla. The court denied a motion to dismiss by all four of the officials, entered summary judgment declaring the law unconstitutional, and ordered the Secretary of State of Florida to expunge the law from the official records of the State of Florida. Two of the officials appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Florida cities and counties sought to invalidate an act relating to growth management, for violating the single subject and unfunded mandate provisions of the Florida Constitution. All four of the state officials contended that they were not proper parties to the action because none was designated to enforce Florida's growth management laws. On appeal, the court found that the proper defendant in a lawsuit challenging a statute's constitutionality was the state official designated to enforce the statute. As such, the state officials clearly were not proper parties to the action. Rather, the Florida Secretary of Community Affairs appeared to be the responsible official, as the Florida Department of Community Affairs was the state land planning agency under &sect;&sect; 163.3164(20), 163.3184(6), and 380.032, Fla. Stat. In sum, the trial court should have granted the motion to dismiss all the state officials from the declaratory action, even though only two of the officials appealed, because they were not proper parties. Accordingly, the lower court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide whether the act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corrected final summary judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the trial court to dismiss complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant holders of leasehold interests in real property sued appellees appraiser and collector, seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction relating to the assessment of ad valorem property taxes. The Circuit Court for Santa Rosa County (Florida) granted summary judgment for the appraiser and the collector and denied the holders' motion for summary judgment. The holders appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The holders challenged the trial court's conclusion that because they were the equitable owners of the real property at issue and any improvements thereon, they were subject to ad valorem property taxes. The appellate court found that, although the holders' deed of conveyance prohibited ownership of the property by private persons, that did not determine the issue. Whether the county was immune from taxation also had no bearing on this issue. The holders enjoyed the capital appreciation and rental income from their interests, they had the right to convey their interests without restraint, and they had the right to encumber the properties with mortgages. They also were responsible for insurance, maintenance and repair. Instead of having an option to purchase at the end of their lease terms, the majority of the holders had the option to renew their leases for additional 99-year terms. All of these factors led to the conclusion that the trial court properly found that the holders were the equitable owners of the real property at issue for ad valorem taxation purposes. As such, the exemption found in &sect; 196.199(2)(b), Fla. Stat. was inapplicable to the holders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed. A question was certified to the Supreme Court of Florida.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant owner sued appellee appraiser, seeking a declaration that he was entitled to a homestead exemption for certain property. The Circuit Court for Monroe County (Florida) entered summary judgment for the owner as to 1999 through 2006 and revoked a tax lien for those years. The trial court then held that the owner was not entitled to the exemption for 2007. The owner and the appraiser appealed and the appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court heard evidence regarding the owners' occupancy and use of another home, the indicia of vacancy and low utility usage at the address he claimed for the exemption, intention as expressed in his driver's license and voter registration records, and other objective criteria. The appellate court found that the trial court applied the correct law and that its findings of fact as to the 2007 exemption were based on substantial and competent evidence. However, as to the 1999 through 2006 exemptions, the summary judgment concluded that the appraiser's revocation of the homestead exemption was a &quot;change in judgment&quot; that may not have been retroactively applied following the close of a tax year. However, retroactive revocation of the homestead exemption (for up to 10 prior years) was the subject of an express legislative enactment, &sect; 196.161, Fla. Stat., and that provision was not subject to the &quot;change in judgment&quot; rule. Section 196.161 was constitutional and enforceable as applied in this case. Statutes involving tax exemptions were strictly construed against the taxpayer and the legislature was not required to enact reciprocal rules as they related to exemptions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The final judgment in favor of the appraiser regarding tax year 2007 was affirmed. The final summary judgment in favor of the owner for tax years 1999-2006 was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for fact-finding regarding the owner's eligibility for the exemption during those years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee attorneys' associations maintained an action against appellant secretary of state, challenging the constitutionality of a proviso in section 8(3)(a)4 of House Bill 5001, which prohibited state agencies from paying Bar dues for that fiscal year. The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) declared the budgetary proviso unconstitutional. The secretary of state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that, because the challenged proviso eliminated the discretion of agency heads to pay Bar dues out of its allocated state funds, the proviso directly contradicted &sect; 216.345, Fla. Stat., which authorized discretion in the payment of such dues. Thus, the trial court declared the proviso to be unconstitutional in violation of Art. III, &sect; 12, Fla. Const. However, the appellate court found that the Attorney General of Florida had consistently delineated that payment of dues for membership in the Bar was not permitted by &sect; 216.345, Fla. Stat. because the payment of these dues was required to maintain an individual's professional trade status. Attorney General opinions were entitled to great weight in construing the law of Florida. The interpretations rendered by the Attorney General opinions were not unreasonable given that the plain language of &sect; 216.345 prohibited payments to maintain an individual's professional or trade status. As such, the Attorney General opinions, coupled with the deference the courts were required to provide to the statute, established that the proviso enacted by the legislature did not conflict with Florida law.</SPAN></P>

The officers observed defendant step from between the vehicles onto the grass. The officers stopped him and demanded to know where he was coming from. Defendant respondent that he was coming from a friend's house and was walking home. The officers charged him with loitering or prowling by crouching between vehicles and endeavoring to conceal himself. When the officers searched defendant incident to arrest, they found a.22 caliber bullet. The appellate court found that the accurate description of defendant's appearance and location was not enough for a stop. The officers had no basis to stop defendant on suspicion of attempted burglary of automobiles. They did not observe him trying to open car doors. The officers lacked a sufficient basis to detain defendant for attempted burglary. They also lacked probable cause to arrest him for loitering or prowling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee doctor sued appellant hospital, seeking injunctive relief for reappointment of his practice privileges at the hospital. The Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, St. Lucie County (Florida), entered a temporary injunction permitting the doctor to continue to practice at the hospital during the pendency of the his suit against the hospital. The hospital appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The hospital argued that &sect; 395.0191, Fla. Stat. (2009) provided it with immunity from suit when the claim arose out of the appointment or reappointment process in the absence of an allegation of intentional fraud. According to the hospital, because the doctor failed to allege intentional fraud with particularity, he failed to overcome the immunity afforded by the statute. The appellate court agreed. The doctor did not specifically allege or offer any evidence of &quot;intentional fraud&quot; sufficient to overcome the immunity provided by the statute. The verified complaint contained mere conclusory allegations, devoid of the requisite specificity. Absent specific allegations of intentional fraud, &sect; 395.0191's immunity protected the hospital. The doctor's claim that the statutory immunity provided by &sect; 395.0191 was limited to initial appointment decisions was incorrect. The trial court erred in issuing the temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant public adjuster filed a complaint against appellee department, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and alleging that &sect; 626.854(6), Fla. Stat. violated his constitutional rights to free speech, equal protection of the laws, and to be rewarded for his industry. The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) entered a final judgment determining that &sect; 626.854(6) was not unconstitutional. The public adjuster appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department conceded at oral argument that if &sect; 626.854(6) was read as a total ban on all solicitation during the first 48 hours, it did not pass constitutional muster. The appellate court found that protecting citizens that had suffered a traumatizing loss from intrusive unsolicited contact by public adjusters by granting them a brief period of breathing room furthered the governmental interest. However, the department's argument that &sect; 626.854(6) did not prohibit written contact ignored the plain, natural meaning of the statute. Because &sect; 626.854(6) unambiguously contained a ban on all solicitation for 48 hours, the department has failed to prove that the statute was narrowly tailored to meet the State's objectives. The department did not demonstrate that prohibiting property owners from receiving any information from public adjusters for a period of 48 hours was justified by the possibility of undue pressure on traumatized victims or otherwise unethical or unprofessional behavior. Nor did the department show that other provisions were insufficient to regulate unduly coercive or misleading solicitation by public adjusters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that he was unlawfully detained when a police officer ordered him to turn off his car engine when the officer noticed him asleep in his parked car, with the motor running, during early morning hours in a shopping mall parking lot. The appeal followed defendant's no contest plea to felony driving with a suspended license (DWLS) and violation of probation. The court found that the order to turn off the car was a seizure. Furthermore, the seizure was not based on a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity or a specific concern for officer safety or the health and safety of the defendant or others. The officer's direction for defendant to turn off his engine constituted a show of authority which restrained defendant's freedom of movement. The record was devoid of facts showing that the officer's instruction to shut off the car was reasonably based on concerns for defendant's safety or was necessary to determine if he needed any aid or assistance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee town filed a complaint for expedited declaratory relief seeking a determination of the constitutionality of a charter amendment proposed by appellant preserve. The Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), granted the town's motion for summary judgment and denied the preserve's cross-motion for summary judgment. The preserve appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The proposed amendment, to be voted on in an election, would have required that the town's charter be amended to incorporate portions of a 1979 Agreement between the town and a developer. The incorporated provisions would have prohibited the construction of new buildings in a specific plaza and would have required that a theater be used for performing and/or visual arts or for lectures or other special events. Prompted by the threat of demolition of the theater, the preserve sponsored a charter amendment petition in an effort to incorporate portions of the 1979 Agreement. The trial court determined that the 1979 Agreement was a development order, and, accordingly, found that the proposed amendment was facially unconstitutional because it conflicted with &sect; 163.3167(12), Fla. Stat. The appellate court agreed with the trial court. The 1979 Agreement did not freeze the zoning as to the developer but granted a variance from zoning with specific conditions. The official act of the town which allowed the development was the execution of the 1979 Agreement, and not the pronouncement of approval during the town meeting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with neglect of a child causing great bodily harm, a second-degree felony under &sect; 827.03(3)(b), Fla. Stat. (2009). Defendant moved to dismiss the charge pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.190(c)(4), and the Circuit Court for Bay County (Florida) granted the motion. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was babysitting a neighbor's child when the child was mauled by defendant's dog. The trial court held that the language of &sect; 39.01(47), Fla. Stat. required that a babysitter be an adult in order to be responsible under &sect; 827.03(3), and that, thus, the &quot;other person responsible for a child's welfare&quot; portion of the definition of &quot;caregiver&quot; in &sect; 827.01(1), Fla. Stat. did not encompass the 17-year-old defendant. The trial court also found that defendant could not have been liable under &sect; 767.13, Fla. Stat. since one had to be an adult to be a responsible dog &quot;owner&quot; under &sect; 767.11(7), Fla. Stat. The appellate court found that the phrase &quot;other person responsible for a child's welfare&quot; was not on its face limited to persons over 18 years of age. Further, the State made a prima facie showing that defendant regularly, if not daily, took care of the two-year-old victim, and was entrusted with and responsible for the child's care and welfare during those times. Defendant's dog had bitten another small child six months before it attacked the victim in this case. A jury question exited as to whether defendant displayed recklessness or careless disregard for the victim's safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee widow sued appellant manufacturer of cigarettes, as an Engle class member, seeking damages for her husband's death. A jury in the Circuit Court for Escambia County (Florida) found, inter alia, that addiction to the manufacturer's cigarettes was a legal cause of the decedent's death, and awarded the widow $ 5 million in compensatory damages, later reduced to $ 3.3 million, and $ 25 million in punitive damages. The manufacturer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The manufacturer argued that, notwithstanding the Engle findings, the widow was required to prove, among other things, that the specific brand cigarettes used by the decedent contained a specific defect rendering the brand unreasonably dangerous. The appellate court disagreed. Because the findings were common to all class members, the widow, under Engle, was entitled to rely on them in her action against the manufacturer. The Engle verdict was conclusive as to the conduct elements of the claims. The cigarette brand used by the decedent was one of the brands named by the class representatives in that case. Individual Engle plaintiffs did not need independently prove up those elements or demonstrate the relevance of the findings to their suits. The record demonstrated the widow was required to prove legal causation, and she produced sufficient evidence for a jury to find that the decedent's addiction to the manufacturer's cigarettes was the legal cause of his death. Although the $ 25 million award was presumed excessive under &sect; 768.73, Fla. Stat. (2005), the trial court's approval of the award was not improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) denied defendant's motion to dismiss a charge of trafficking in more than 28 grams of hydrocodone, in violation of &sect; 893.135(6), (7), Fla. Stat. (2009). Defendant pled no contest to trafficking in hydrocodone and possession of Alprazolam, reserving his right to appeal the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss the trafficking in hydrocodone charge. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the statutory requirement that the aggregate weight of the specific brand tablets be used to determine his sentence was unconstitutional because other brands of hydrocodone tablets weighed less than those tablets by virtue of the fact that lesser amounts of analgesics were contained in other brands of tablets that contained hydrocodone, thereby subjecting him to a harsher sentence than those who trafficked the other brands. A pharmacist's testimony supported defendant's claims. However, the appellate court found that there was a rational basis for the legislature to adopt the sentencing schedule of &sect; 893.135(1)(c)(1), (6), (7), Fla. Stat. (2009). The legislature had recognized the widespread use and abuse of hydrocodone as an area of special concern and acted accordingly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment and the sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee owner of property in a subdivision sought to intervene in an action brought by a homeowner's association, and sought to set aside a tax sale of certain property to appellant buyers. The Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) allowed the owner's intervention, and subsequently, entered summary final judgment in his favor, setting the tax deed sale aside due to the lack of notice to him. The buyers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property at issue was encumbered by an easement allowing residents of the subdivision, among other things, access to a lake. The owner's property was in the subdivision and contiguous to this property. The appellate court held that &sect; 193.0235(2)(b), Fla. Stat. applied. The easement ran directly through the subdivision. The property described in the tax certificate was a common element of the subdivision. There was nothing to indicate that the easement property was not a common element of the subdivision before the effective date of the statute. And, the tax deed sale did not take place until after the effective date of &sect;&sect; 193.0235(2), 197.502(4)(h), Fla. Stat. The owner was entitled to notice pursuant to &sect; 197.502(4)(h) as he was the titleholder of record of property that was contiguous to the property described in the tax certificate, which property was a common element of the subdivision. Neither notice was provided, and, thus, the owner was denied due process and the trial court was correct in voiding the tax sale. However, the trial court erroneously found that the appraiser improperly split the easement property into two parcels at a time when taxes were outstanding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's judgment voiding the tax deeds was affirmed. The trial court's finding that the county appraiser improperly split the easement property into two parcels at a time when taxes were outstanding was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent State filed a petition against appellant former inmate, seeking an order of commitment under the Involuntary Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act (Act), &sect;&sect; 394.910-931, Fla. Stat. (2005). The Circuit Court for Collier County (Florida) denied the former inmate's motion to dismiss. The former inmate then sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the trial court from conducting further proceedings on the commitment petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former inmate asserted that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the commitment petition because, although he was in custody when proceedings under the Act were commenced on December 6, 2005, he was not in lawful custody at that time. The former inmate relied on the affidavit of a Department of Corrections administrator which stated that, with the application of the prior prison and jail credit, the former inmate's sentence expired on August 31, 2005. The trial court found that the former inmate was in lawful custody when the proceedings were initiated because the time period from August 31, 2005 to December 6, 2005 was within the legal term of the former inmate's sentence of 5.5 years. However, the appellate court found that the sentence of 5.5 years was illegal because the court failed to award prior jail and prison credit. Thus, the former inmate was not in lawful custody when the State initiated commitment proceedings in December 2005. &quot;Custody&quot; meant &quot;lawful custody.&quot; The &quot;safety valve&quot; of &sect; 394.9135, Fla. Stat. did not apply because lawful custody was required before the State was allowed to initiate commitment proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petition for a writ of prohibition was granted and the State's commitment petition was dismissed with prejudice. A question was certified to the Supreme Court of Florida.</SPAN></P>

In 2000 he filed a postconviction motion claiming that he was entitled to be resentenced under the 1994 sentencing guidelines. The postconviction court granted relief on the prisoner's claim, and  the court resentenced him to 31.75 months in prison followed by six years' probation. On the date of resentencing, the state filed its petition to have the prisoner committed under the Act. The prisoner asserted that because of his resentencing, he was not in lawful custody when the State commenced commitment proceedings. The appellate court found that factual issues precluded the court from determining whether the prisoner was in lawful custody when the state commenced proceedings under the Act, and transferred the petition to the circuit court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to resolve this issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant owner of real property brought a challenge to the constitutionality of appellee downtown development authority (DDA) and the property tax imposed to fund the DDA. The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) entered summary judgment dismissing the case. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The central issue before the trial court at this procedural stage was whether the owner's challenge was barred by the &sect; 95.11(3), Fla. Stat. (2008) four-year statute of limitations. The ordinance for the DDA levy challenged by the owner was Miami, Fla., City Ordinance 13029, passed in September 2008. The appellate court found that the four-year statute of limitations, &sect; 95.11(3), applied to and barred the owner's challenges to the establishment of the DDA and its boundaries. Those allegedly-unconstitutional statutes and ordinances were enacted six years before, and earlier, than when the lawsuit was filed. In the case of the separate and later Miami, Fla., City Ordinance 13029, imposing the half-mill DDA levy for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2008, however, the challenged ordinance was enacted by the city within the limitation period and thus the challenge was not time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed as it pertained to the state and municipal actions establishing the DDA and its territorial boundaries. The portion of the judgment determining that the four-year statute of limitations barred the owner's constitutional challenge to the 2008 ordinance fixing a half-mill per dollar ad valorem tax exclusively within the boundaries of the DDA district was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) cancelled a tax deed issued to appellant buyer of the deed and quieted title in appellee owner of the property. Although the judgment required the owner to repay the buyer certain amounts, the trial court refused to require the owner to pay interest as required by &sect; 197.602, Fla. Stat. to the buyer on the amounts it paid to acquire the tax deed. The buyer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that the owner did not receive proper notice of the tax deed sale, and that the tax deed sale should have been set aside. The owner also argued below, and the trial court found, that application of the plain wording of &sect; 197.602 making the owner responsible for the interest on the amount paid for the tax deed, amounted to a violation of the owner's due process rights. The appellate court found that this was error. Under the clear terms of &sect; 197.602, the buyer was entitled to an interest award not just on the amount it paid to satisfy the owner's taxes, but also on the $ 64,200 it paid to acquire the tax deed. This outcome did not impinge on the owner's due process rights. His due process and &quot;redemption&quot; rights were vindicated when the trial court nullified the tax deed. The buyer should have been awarded interest not just on the amount it paid to satisfy the former owner's taxes, but also on the money it paid to acquire the tax deed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The portion of the judgment entered below which denied an interest award on the amount paid by the buyer to acquire the tax deed at issue was reversed with the matter was remanded for entry of an award of interest on the amount paid for the tax deed and all taxes paid upon the land, together with 12-percent interest thereon per year from the date of the issuance of the tax deed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Circuit Court for Suwannee County (Florida) denied defendant's motions to suppress statements he made and other evidence, a jury convicted defendant of first-degree murder, abuse of a dead human body and tampering with evidence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's elderly mother was reported missing and defendant was questioned. Defendant was then arrested on an unrelated firearm charge and held in the county jail on that charge. While incarcerated, defendant made incriminating statements regarding his mother's disappearance to two Jehovah's Witnesses elders who were visiting the jail. Defendant argued that these statements were privileged under &sect; 90.505(2), Fla. Stat. (2007). The appellate court found that, even if the elders were members of the clergy, defendant's statements to them were not made for the purpose of seeking spiritual counsel and advice. One of the elders said that defendant did not indicate that he was seeking spiritual counseling and guidance and did not want to talk about the Bible or pray. The trial court could have found that defendant was instead trying to explain his side of the story. The evidence also failed to establish that defendant's communications were either made privately or not intended for further disclosure except to persons present in furtherance of the communication. Further, defendant's statements to a jailer were not made pursuant to interrogation and were not subject to suppression.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner pled guilty to robbery with a firearm, attempted robbery with a firearm and attempted first-degree murder with a firearm. The attempted murder convictions were each life felonies and were punishable by a term of imprisonment for life or by a term of imprisonment not exceeding 40 years. On the first attempted murder conviction, the trial court sentenced the prisoner to a term of &quot;natural life.&quot; On the second attempted murder conviction, the trial court sentenced the prisoner to a concurrent term of 40 years in prison. The prisoner was 13 years old. The prisoner asserted that his two sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution because he was a juvenile when he committed the nonhomicide offenses at issue. The appellate court found that the United States Supreme Court had held that for a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide the Eighth Amendment forbids the sentence of life without parole. The prisoner's sentence of 40 years in prison on the second conviction for attempted murder with a firearm was unaffected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants users of appellee county's wastewater system brought an action challenging the validity of a duly enacted resolution of the county's board of commissioners setting utility rates for its wastewater system users. The Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) dismissed the complaint. The users appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The users only challenged the county's readiness-to-serve/capacity cost component. This charge reflected the cost of maintaining capacity for each customer. The rate was based on the customer's water meter size-the larger the meter size, the higher the rate. The users' readiness-to-serve/capacity charge was based on the use of their eight inch water meter. They acknowledged that they were connected to the water system by an eight inch line. However, they argued that the eight inch line had valves or flaps so that water by-passed the eight inch meter and went into a smaller line. The valves or flaps would only open if the fire line opened or the line broke. The appellate court found, however, that the fact that the actual use of the eight inch line was far less than its maximum potential use did not render the county's rate schedule illegal. Further, the readiness-to-serve/capacity cost component of the county's rate schedule was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or discriminatory. The only mandatory provision in &sect; 153.11(1)(c), Fla. Stat (2008) stated that the fees had to be &quot;just&quot; and &quot;equitable.&quot; The lack of actual use did not render a fee unjust or inequitable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, individuals, banks and mortgage companies, appealed the order of the Circuit Court for Lake County (Fla.) that denied their motion to intervene in the mortgage foreclosure proceedings initiated by appellee lender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The action involved a complicated development project. The lender asserted that the motion to intervene was untimely because it was filed beyond the 20-day window allowed for intervention established by &sect; 48.23(1)(b), Fla. Stat. Appellants claimed that &sect; 48.23(1)(b)&nbsp;unconstitutionally conflicted with Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.230. Appellants further argued that &sect; 48.23(1)(b) usurped the Florida Supreme Court's rulemaking authority. The lender disagreed, arguing, inter alia, that the statute was substantive, not procedural, and was properly enacted by the legislature. The appellate court found that &sect; 48.23(1)(b) was substantive and that any procedural provisions contained within it were intimately related to the definition of those substantive rights. As such, &sect; 48.23(1)(b) did not violate art. V, &sect; 2(a) Fla. Const. Therefore, the trial court properly concluded that appellants' motion to intervene was untimely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant entered an open no contest plea to robbery with a deadly weapon. Defendant was sentenced to 30 years in prison with a 10-year mandatory minimum under the 10-20-LIFE law, &sect; 775.087(2)(a), Fla. Stat., based on his possession of a firearm. Defendant then filed a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion to correct sentence. The Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, St. Lucie County (Florida), denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the 10-year minimum term imposed under &sect; 775.087(2)(a) was unlawful because the statute was not cited in the information, because the information alleged use of a deadly weapon or firearm, because there was no evidence that a firearm was used, and because he was not convicted of using a firearm. The appellate court found that these issues had been argued and rejected in a prior motion which was denied and affirmed on direct appeal. Defendant admitted possession of a firearm when he stipulated to the factual basis and entered his plea aware that the 10-year mandatory minimum for possession of a firearm would apply. Defense counsel acknowledged at the Rule 3.800(b)(2) hearing that defendant was aware when he entered his plea that the ten-year mandatory minimum could be imposed based on his possession of a firearm. The trial court correctly ruled that defendant was barred from rearguing these issues. Further, the trial court did not err in failing to issue an order to show cause before finding that defendant had brought a frivolous action and in referring defendant to the Department of Corrections under &sect; 944.279(1), Fla. Stat.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner patient brought a medical negligence suit against respondent board. The patient sought a motion to compel a non-party to produce all records of adverse medical incidents in its possession regarding the patient, including a risk management incident report and a peer review form. The trial court (Florida) denied the patient's motion. The patient sought certiorari review of the order denying the motion to compel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint alleged that physicians negligently intubated the patient for general anesthesia, causing a perforation that injured him. Because the patient was under the effects of pre-anesthesia when the injury occurred and could not recall what happened, he argued the records at issue were the only accurate account of the injury and were material to the claim. The non-party argued that its own investigation concluded that the incident did not involve negligence and was, therefore, not an &quot;adverse medical incident&quot; requiring disclosure of the records under Amendment 7, Art. X, &sect; 25(a), Fla. Const. The appellate court found that the phrase &quot;adverse medical incident&quot; in Amendment 7 meant a specific incident involving a specific patient that caused or could have caused injury to or the death of that patient. An adverse medical incident may have been a negligent act or omission, but the act or omission must have been connected with a patient and must have been the cause or near-cause of an injury or death. By meeting the &sect; 766.203(2), Fla. Stat. (2005) presuit notice requirements for a malpractice claim, the patient made a showing that this was an adverse medical incident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The writ was granted, the first paragraph of the order was quashed, and the case was remanded with instructions to the trial court to order the non-party to produce all records of adverse medical incidents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An adoptive parent brought a petition against appellant department, seeking to adopt appellee children. The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) ruled that &sect; 63.042(3), Fla. Stat. (2006) was unconstitutional and granted the petition for adoption. The department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was whether the adoption should have been denied because the adoptive parent was a homosexual. The parties agreed that the adoptive parent was a fit parent and that the adoption was in the best interest of the children. The appellate court found that there was no rational basis in using homosexual persons as foster parents or guardians on a temporary or permanent basis, while imposing a blanket prohibition on adoption by those same persons. The reports and studies presented to the trial court found that there were no differences in the parenting of homosexuals or the adjustment of their children. The best interests of children were not preserved by banning homosexual adoption. The department argued that the alternative views expressed by the expert witnesses supported the existence of a rational basis for &sect; 63.042(3), Fla. Stat., but the appellate court disagreed. The department argued that homosexuals should have been barred from adopting because their homes may have been less stable and more prone to domestic violence, but the record did not support this. The trial court properly ruled that &sect; 63.042(3) violated the Art. I, &sect; 2, Fla. Const. equal protection provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a workers' compensation proceeding, petitioner claimant sought a writ of certiorari to quash a non-final order of the Judge of Compensation Claims (Florida) (JCC) compelling him to produce intake documents created by his attorney. The documents were sought by appellee employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The intake documents had been sought by the employer for the purpose of obtaining lists of the doctors and the hospitals which treated the claimant and lists of the claimant's prior workers' compensation claims which were set forth in those documents. The appellate court found that these documents were protected by the &sect; 90.502, Fla. Stat. (2009) attorney-client privilege. Allowing discovery of the attorney's intake documents would not only have intruded into work product, but would have allowed the adversary to function on the wits and labor of an opponent. Such an interpretation would be antithetical to the purposes underlying the attorney-client privilege and would additionally have imposed a chilling effect on an attorney's efforts to fully explore and memorialize the facts underlying his client's cause. Further, if, as asserted by the employer, the facts communicated in a confidential meeting with an attorney were not protected by attorney-client privilege, a client would have had little incentive to fully disclose information to his own attorney for fear that the confidential communication will be used against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner workers sued respondent farm, seeking back wages. The trial court dismissed approximately 1500 workers for failure to pay the cost bond pursuant to &sect; 57.011, Fla. Stat. The Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), sitting in its appellate capacity, affirmed. The workers then sought second-tier certiorari review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Certiorari review from an appellate decision of a trial court was limited to instances where the trial court did not afford due process or departed from the essential requirements of law. There was no question that the trial court afforded due process. The issue raised was thus whether the trial court departed from clearly established law resulting in a gross miscarriage of justice. The appellate court found that it did not. Without controlling precedent, it could not have been concluded that a trial court violated a clearly established principle of law. The workers argued that &sect; 57.011 was unconstitutional because it violated the Art. I, &sect; 21, Fla. Const. open courts provision. A case cited by the workers was inapplicable because, inter alia, the $ 100 cost bond under &sect; 57.011 was minimal. The statute did not set a condition precedent to filing a suit. The decisions appeared to diverge when analyzing minimal fees or expenses involved in litigation. In a proper case brought on direct appeal, this issue would have been ripe for consideration. The scope of review on second-tier certiorari was much narrower. There was no clearly established law to apply to this provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court declined jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pickup truck owner brought suit against appellee city. He argued that zoning ordinances violated his right of freedom of association under U.S. Const. amend. I and that they were unconstitutionally vague. The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) granted the city's motion for summary judgment and entered a declaratory judgment action in favor of the city. Appellant challenged the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinances prohibited the parking of trucks in residential areas of the city except for in garages and the parking of trucks in the city from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Appellant used his truck for personal rather than business purposes. The court held that the ordinances did not impinge upon appellant's fundamental right of freedom of association by preventing him from visiting his friends or by preventing friends with trucks from visiting him. The ordinances permitted appellant to own and drive his pickup truck. He simply had to garage it at night. The ordinances bore a rational relationship to a legitimate public purpose, preserving the residential character and the aesthetics of the city's neighborhoods. The ordinances were not unconstitutional as applied to appellant's open-bed truck, as they prohibited trucks containing space for transporting or delivering property. Next, the ordinances were not void for vagueness. They forbade the overnight parking of &quot;trucks,&quot; and appellant's pickup clearly fell within the zoning code's definition of &quot;truck.&quot; Appellant lacked standing to challenge the ordinances on the premise that they could conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insurance company appealed the judgment of the County Court for Sarasota County (Fla.) that entered a final declaratory judgment in favor of appellee medical group in their complaint for further payment of medical bills for care provided to the company's insured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurance company asserted that a 2008 amendment to the personal injury protection (PIP) statute,&nbsp;&sect; 627.736, Fla. Stat. (2008), allowed it to reduce payment to the medical group. The county court ruled that the amendment did not apply to the insurance policy in this case because the policy was in effect prior to the effective date of the amendment. The appellate court found that the 2008 version of &sect; 627.736 was not made retroactive by the legislature and it therefore applied only to insurance policies that were in effect on or after January 1, 2008. A plain reading of the 2008 law did not indicate a legislative intent that the amendments apply retroactively. In fact, &sect; 627.7407(2), Fla. Stat. (2008), adopted in 2007 specifically provided that any personal injury protection policy in effect on or after January 1, 2008, shall be deemed to incorporate the provisions of the Florida Motor Vehicle No-Fault Law, as revived and amended by this act. Significantly limiting the amount an insurer would reimburse providers for medical expenses by thousands of dollars was clearly a substantive change that would impair the vested rights of the insured if applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that prosecution was barred by the &sect; 775.15(2)(b) three-year limitation and that &sect; 775.15(16)(a) did not apply here because the State had the necessary DNA evidence to arrest and prosecute him as early as September 1, 2006. However, the appellate court found that the plain language of &sect; 775.15(16)(a) provided that defendant could have been prosecuted at any time after September 1, 2006, when the Florida Department of Law Enforcement established a close link between defendant's DNA and that of the blood sample found at the crime scene. The crime occurred in April 2005. In 2006, the legislature added &sect; 775.15(16)(a), which extended the statute of limitations applicable to defendant's crime. The legislature's action was constitutionally permissible as applied to defendant, because in 2006 defendant could have been prosecuted under the statute of limitations in effect in 2005. Section 775.15(16)(a) came into effect in July 2006, less than three years after defendant's crime, when prosecution was not barred by &sect; 775.15(2)(b). Additionally, &sect; 775.15(16)(b) indicated it applied to any offense that was not otherwise barred from prosecution on or after July, 1, 2006.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On April 5, 2007, and May 1, 2007, appellant had DNA tests performed which showed that he was not the father of the child upon whom the tests were conducted. He filed the petition on September 28, 2007. The court stated that the plain language of the statute made it clear that scientific testing was a mandatory requirement for a trial court to consider and grant a petition to disestablish paternity. The court had already made it clear that when a petitioner relied upon tests administered prior to the filing of the petition, the mandated test had to also comply with the provision which stated that the tests had be administered within 90 days prior to the filing of the petition. In other words, once a man received the results of a scientific test confirming he was not the father, he had to choose to act on those results within 90 days of the date the test was administered. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting the motion to dismiss for failure to comply with the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee public adjusters filed suit against appellants, the Chief Financial Officer of the State of Florida, the Florida Department of Financial Services, and the State of Florida. Appellants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, to transfer venue to Leon County. The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) denied appellants' motion. Appellants challenged the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees argued that the enforcement of &sect; 626.854(6) and (11)(b)(2), Fla. Stat., was a violation of their constitutional rights sufficient to merit application of the sword-wielder exception to Florida's common law home venue privilege, which provided that venue was proper in the county where a agency maintained its principal headquarters. The court rejected this argument. The actions alleged in the complaint, namely, the restrictions on speech and the time, place, and manner of conducting business caused by &sect; 626.854(6) and the denial of due process by &sect; 626.854(11)(b)(2), did not coincide with, and appeared to have no connection to, the alleged activities of the Department against appellees in Miami-Dade County. Moreover, because of the lack of connection between the supposed infringement and denial of constitutional rights and the Department's various activities related to appellees, it could not be said that appellees' action in filing the complaint was in the nature of a shield against the State's thrust. As appellees were unable to sufficiently establish the application of the sword-wielder doctrine, the home venue privilege should have been applied by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's order. It remanded the case with instructions that venue be transferred to Leon County.</SPAN></P>

X, &sect; 25(a), Fla. Stat. (Amendment 7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners alleged that hospital physicians negligently intubated the husband for general anesthesia before a scheduled appendectomy which caused a perforation that injured his hypopharynx with severe damage to his larynx and throat.

Petitioners moved to compel the hospital to produce its risk management incident report and peer review record (which were identified in the hospital's privilege log) and any other records of adverse medical incidents involving the husband. The appellate court found that because the requested documents were the hospital's records relating to an adverse medical incident, the trial court failed to comply with the requirements of Amendment 7. The trial court overlooked protected constitutional rights and departed from the essential requirements of law in denying the motion to compel production of the two records.</SPAN></P>

This did not necessarily mean that petitioner was entitled to be released from the Florida Civil Commitment Center, however. Commitment proceedings could be initiated by giving written notice to the multidisciplinary team and the state attorney as provided in &sect; 394.913(1), Fla. Stat. (1999). Thus, even if petitioner was not in lawful custody at the time the commitment petition was filed, the question remained whether he was in lawful custody when the State provided written notice to the multidisciplinary team pursuant to &sect; 394.913(1). Furthermore, petitioner had raised an issue as to alternative dates by which he should have been released from prison based on whether he was awarded gain time. The court was unable to make factual determinations regarding all of these dates; thus, it had to transfer the habeas petition to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing on whether, with the award of gain time, commitment proceedings were commenced prior to the date of the expiration of petitioner's sentence following his resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action between appellee former police officers and appellants, a city and its police pension board of trustees (&quot;city&quot;), the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida) entered summary judgment in favor of the officers. It held that former police officers who left service prior to vesting in the police pension fund were entitled to a refund of their contributions to the fund. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relying on &sect; 185.35(1), Fla. Stat. (2000), the city claimed that any refund was a pension &quot;benefit&quot; that had to await receipt of premium tax income funds. The court stated that a Department of Revenue witness's opinion that the contribution refunds were &quot;minimum benefits&quot; was neither binding nor persuasive. Nothing in &sect; 185.35(1) compelled the conclusion that a contribution refund was a benefit. The witness's opinion, little more than a bare assertion, did not reflect the reasoned development of agency policy. The court saw no reason why &sect; 185.35, relating to premium tax income, had any bearing on the rights of the officers here. Section 185.19(1), Fla. Stat. (2000) stated that officers &quot;shall be entitled to&quot; their contributions without interest and less any benefits paid. In the context of the contributions, the phrase &quot;shall be entitled to&quot; was a command and not a matter of convenience. Requiring a refund did not create an unconstitutional unfunded mandate under Art. 10, &sect; 14, Fla. Const.&nbsp;Section 185.19(1) did not create a benefit or enhance the status of the officers. It merely established an entitlement to a refund. Finally, the city's estoppel argument failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Division advised the city regarding the effect of ch. 99-1 on the city's police and firefighter pension plan, the city filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, asserting that the Division's application of ch. 99-1 violated Art. I, &sect; 10, Fla. Const. The appellate court found, inter alia, that retirees under the plan only had a vested right to the annual increment in benefits made possible by premium tax revenue received by the city. Because the retirees' right to receive the additional annual benefit increase was dependent on continued legislative appropriations and the plan's compliance with current law, it was either an expectant or a contingent right. The Division's application of ch. 99-1 to the plan did not impair retirees' vested rights under the prior agreement. Nothing in the record showed that the city maintained a separate supplemental plan in conjunction with its defined benefit plan in accordance with &sect; 185.35(1)(b), Fla. Stat. (1999). Consequently, because the city was required to pay overtime in accordance with &sect; 185.02(4), Fla. Stat. (1999), the trial court erred in granting its motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Florida Sheriffs Workers' Compensation Self-Insurance Fund, appealed a final order of the Department of Financial Services wherein the Department denied appellant's applications for refund of the $ 6,638,301.35 that it had paid to the Special Disability Trust Fund (SDTF) between 2002, the year appellant was formed, and 2008.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Assessments for the SDTF were made pursuant to &sect; 440.49, Fla. Stat. A 1997 amendment to the statute limited reimbursement of claims to accidents occurring before January 1, 1998, but continued assessments on insurance companies. Appellant's as-applied constitutional challenge to the SDTF assessment was based upon its contention that it was ineligible for reimbursement from the fund. Appellant contended that the SDTF assessment constituted a special assessment, not a tax, that should be constitutionally analyzed under City of Boca Raton. The appellate court disagreed, concluding that the SDTF assessment was more akin to the assessments at issue in Coy and Hameroff, both of which were found to be constitutional under the rational basis test. Those decisions applied regardless of the fact that the funds held in the SDTF did not constitute state funds pursuant to &sect; 440.49(9). The continued operation of the SDTF served an important public purpose. Even if appellant had not directly benefitted from the SDTF, pre-1998 claims continued to be reimbursed as a result of post-1998 assessments, thereby furthering the legislative intent of the 1997 amendment of &sect; 440.49.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant parents sought review of a judgment from the Division of Administrative Hearings (Ohio), which awarded them $ 100,000 jointly, in parental compensation, pursuant to &sect; 766.31(1)(b)1., Fla. Stat. (2007) under the Florida Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Plan (Plan).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents argued that &sect; 766.31(1)(b)1. was ambiguous and should be construed to authorize an award of up to $ 100,000 to each parent rather than a single award in such amount to both parents. They also argued that such a construction would avoid three constitutional problems: equal protection, vagueness, and access to courts. Upon review, the court found that the language of &sect; 766.31(1)(b)1. could not reasonably be interpreted to provide multiple awards of $ 100,000 to each parent of a qualifying child. Furthermore, the court rejected the parents' contention that the Plan did not clearly define the extent to which parental filial consortium claims had been abrogated. In addition, the court found no equal protection violation because &sect; 766.31(1)(b)1. did not result in the disparate treatment of similarly situated people within the class of parents. Moreover, &sect; 766.31(1)(b)1., was sufficiently clear in its intent to provide no-fault economic compensation to parents and thus was not vague. Finally, the Plan provided both a reasonable alternative remedy and a commensurate benefit so as to not create problems with access to the courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the joint award but certified a question as one of great public importance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Around midnight, two police officer noticed defendant outside an apartment complex with an assault-type rifle by his side as he was walking with another man to a vehicle with its engine running but its lights off.

The officers followed and, with the front door still open, entered the apartment where they found a rifle and over 20 grams of marijuana, which defendant admitted were his. The trial court granted the motion to suppress concluding that defendant's action would have been a misdemeanor and that the officer could not follow him into the apartment for that purpose. On appeal, the court did not agree. The court concluded that the time of day, the presence of an assault-type rifle, the disregarded commands to stop, and the possible threat of an uncooperative suspect with a weapon, were overwhelming reasons to follow defendant into the home under the hot pursuit exception under &sect; 901.15, Fla. Stat. (2008), and thus, no constitutional violation occurred. Furthermore, defendant's reliance on the knock and announce statute,&nbsp;&sect; 901.19(1), Fla. Stat. (2007), was misplaced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The agency destroyed over 100,000 non-commercial trees not affected with citrus canker. The owners sought just compensation with regard to the destruction of their trees. The agency argued it was not liable for any damages as a matter of law because healthy trees exposed to citrus canker constituted a public nuisance that had no value, that exposed citrus would itself develop canker and become worthless. The agency also challenged the trial court's measure of damages. The appellate court found that cutting down and destroying healthy non-commercial trees of private citizens could hardly be more definitively a taking. The only effect of &sect; 581.1845, Fla. Stat., was to set an opening bid for the price the state would pay without litigation. There was no error in the trial judge's decision not to rely on the agency's witnesses who used the reduction in value of real estate as the measurement. The issue was not the value of the existing real estate but the value of the trees destroyed. The trial judge did not err by calculating pre-judgment interest from the filing date of the case, while giving the agency credit for set-offs in the year in which they were actually provided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 2005, the individual pled guilty to possession of cocaine. In 2004, the state had nol prossed another action against him for possession of methamphetamine. Although resolved at the same time, the two cases were unrelated -- involving separate and distinct alleged criminal activity, arrest dates, informations, and court files. In 2008, the individual requested and obtained an order sealing the court record in the cocaine case. He subsequently filed the petition in the instant case in which he sought to seal the court record in the methamphetamine case. The appellate court found that the adoption of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.692 and 3.989 reflected the Florida Supreme Court's intent to limit the circumstances in which a party could request the sealing of a record so as to appropriately balance the policy of public access to court records against the competing policy of providing a second chance to criminal defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), in an action seeking to prohibit appellee Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections, from using State funds under &sect;&sect; 944.473 and 944.4731, Fla. Stat. (2007), to support the faith-base substance abuse transitional housing programs of appellees organizations. The organizations and Secretary filed a motion for rehearing en banc of the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants alleged that payments to the organizations constituted payments to churches, sects, religious sects, religious denominations or sectarian institutions contrary to the so-called no-aid provision in art. I, &sect; 3, Fla. Const., challenged the contracts entered into with the organizations, and sought to bar the Secretary from delegating government authority and powers to chaplains pursuant to &sect; 944.4731(6)(a). The trial court entered a final judgment on the pleadings in favor of appellees on all counts. Upon review, the court found that the trial court erred in ruling that the no-aid provision was limited to the school context and, thus, did not apply to &sect;&sect; 944.473 and 944.4731. However, the court agreed with the trial court's determination that appellants lacked taxpayer standing to pursue their second claim because it did not constitute a challenge to the government's taxing and spending powers. As to the third claim, the court found that the amended petition did not state a cause of action under art. I, &sect; 3, based on the alleged unlawful delegation of authority to prison chaplains. Finally, less than a majority of the judges voted in favor of rehearing en banc.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the portion of the judgment regarding the application of the no-aid provision, affirmed the remainder of the judgment, remanded for further proceedings, certified a question for review, and denied the motion for rehearing en banc.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the owners were unsuccessful in obtaining permits, they filed the underlying inverse condemnation action. The trial court found that the owners claims were time-barred by the four year statute of limitations contained in &sect; 95.11, Fla. Stat. The court found that the owners were denied permits and took no further action until 14 years later when they filed their beneficial use determination application. This was well after the four-year limitations period. Once the owners were denied a permit and in no uncertain terms had been advised by a governmental entity that a particular use of that property, such as a single family residence, was not permissible due to land use regulations, it became clear that further attempts at obtaining permits in the future, especially in light of more restrictive ordinances, would be futile. As such, once a clear determination was made by a governmental entity as to permit application for land use or development, the statute of limitations for an inverse condemnation action begins to run. The owners had to then appeal the permit denial or file a beneficial use determination application prior to the expiration of the four-year limitations period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The members filed an action seeking to challenging the constitutionality of the city's occupational license tax. Because occupational license taxes were common throughout the state, the members filed the action for themselves and all others similarly situated, against the city, individually, and as representative of all other Florida municipalities similarly situated. The non-county defendants were dismissed based on the home venue privilege. The members argued that the home venue privilege did not apply because the unnamed non-county defendant class members were not real parties in the case. The members contended that, because they were merely defendant class members, the non-county defendant class members could not raise the home venue privilege. The court held that there were only four recognized exceptions to the home venue privilege, and the underlying case did not fall under any of them. On the facts of the case, it was not legally possible to conclude that the defendant class members were not, in effect, parties to the litigation for purposes of asserting their home venue privilege, or that the trial court abused its discretion in finding the home venue privilege applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant personal representative sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) in a wrongful death, medical malpractice action filed against appellee hospital. The personal representative alleged that the hospital should have had a pediatric surgeon on staff to handle emergencies in its neonatal unit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The personal representative challenged the limitation of liability imposed on the award to the mother, challenged the trial court's decision to deny the father any compensation, and challenged the trial court's decision to direct a verdict on the claim of fraud in the inducement. The court held that &sect; 766.209(4), Fla. Stat. (2003), placing a limit on noneconomic damages, was constitutional as other remedies were available and the collection of statutes limiting access to the courts in medical malpractice cases were supported by legislative findings explaining a then-existing crisis. The cap in &sect; 766.209 was not merely an effect of refusing arbitration; it was a cap on common law damages awarded in a trial by jury that is guaranteed in art. I, &sect; 22, Fla. Const. It was a limitation that could be created by the willingness to arbitrate for an even lower award whenever such arbitration is in the best self-interest of the defendant. The trial court did err however with regard to changing the father's award from $ 4 million to zero. The testimony did not establish prima facie evidence that a doctor made a false statement concerning a material fact, as necessary to establish fraud.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the award to the mother, reversed the award to the father and remanded for entry of a judgment for the limits provided in &sect; 766.209(4), affirmed remainder of the judgment, and certified a question regarding the limitation on the noneconomic damages in &sect; 766.209(4).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant hospital sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, St. Lucie County (Florida), which found the hospital liable on appellee surgeon's breach of contract claim, found the hospital liable in a slander per se claim, and found that the surgeon was entitled to punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">With regard to the breach of contract claim, the hospital asserted immunity from liability to the surgeon under &sect; 395.0191(7), Fla. Stat. (2009). Otherwise, the hospital only sought review of the amount of punitive damages claiming that the amount was excessive. On appeal, the court found that the breach of contract claim was not barred by the statutory immunity provision as the surgeon did not allege or rely on any violation of the statute bur rather alleged and proved that, contrary to its own bylaws, the hospital invalidly granted an outside surgeon exclusive cardiovascular surgery privileges and used it to stop the surgeon from performing cardiovascular surgeries. In addition, the court determined that a reasonable jury could conclude that repeatedly defaming the skill and proficiency of a practicing surgeon was likely to have significant and long-lasting public and professional consequences. Finally, not only did the extraordinary wrongdoing justify the extraordinary civil punishment without limiting ratios, but the jury's verdict was not disproportionate under federal law and allowed under &sect; 768.73, Fla. Stat. (2009).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The borrowers argued that the bank's failure to obtain and hold a &quot;certificate of authority&quot; from the Florida Department of State precluded the bank from transacting business in Florida including securing, collecting, and enforcing debts, mortgages, and security interests. Second, the borrowers asserted that inconsistencies as to the monies owed to the bank contained in the bank's verified complaint, loan statements, and affidavits created a genuine issue of material fact, thereby precluding summary judgment. The bank contended that the National Bank Act preempted Florida's requirement that all foreign corporations doing business in Florida obtain a &quot;certificate of authority&quot; in order to, among other things, maintain lawsuits in this state. The appellate court found that under 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 24 the state could not require a national bank to register or file as a &quot;foreign corporation&quot; in order to maintain a lawsuit in state court. As such, &sect; 607.1502(1), Fla. Stat., was preempted as applied to the bank which was a national bank. At no time did the borrowers offered a contrary calculation of the monies owed; they merely contended that they did not owe the amounts alleged by the bank.</SPAN></P>

He alleged that staff at the civil commitment center after observing pornography on the computer that the detainee was using, forcefully removed his zip drive from the computer.

The detainee further alleged that during the episode his face was pushed into a wall by security personnel and that he ultimately was placed in confinement as a punishment for this episode. The appellate court found that the detainee alleged in his habeas petition that he had been removed from his regular room and was being held in restrictive confinement. He further alleged that such confinement was punishment for the computer lab episode and that it violated his constitutional rights. This amounted to a facially sufficient claim and the petition should be addressed on its merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner pled no contest to failure to register as a sexual offender in violation of &sect; 943.0435(9), Fla. Stat. (2007). He was designated a sexual offender because he had been convicted of false imprisonment in another county. The prisoner claimed that his counsel was ineffective for incorrectly advising him that he had no defense to his sexual offender designation and that the designation automatically flowed from his prior false imprisonment conviction. He claimed that the false imprisonment offense had no sexual component and that he was not designated a sexual offender in the other county. The appellate court found that if counsel failed to advise the prisoner of a potentially viable defense based on the lack of a sexual component to his false imprisonment offense, then counsel's performance could have been deficient. Additionally, the prisoner's claim of prejudice--that he would have proceeded to trial--was credible if he could demonstrate that the defense was viable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant doctor sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida), which denied the doctor's motion to limit the judgment pursuant to the statutory cap of Fla. Stat. &sect; 766.118 (2003) and awarded appellees, a patient and her husband, $ 1.5 million in noneconomic damages in a medical malpractice lawsuit regarding a certain operation, which occurred in January 2003, and in the follow up care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees served the doctor with a notice of intent to initiate medical malpractice litigation in 2005, and they filed suit in 2006. The &sect; 766.118 statutory cap on noneconomic damages in certain medical malpractices case went into effect in late 2003. The statute's enabling clause stated that it applied to any medical incident for which a notice of intent to initiate litigation was mailed on or after the effective date. In denying the doctor's motion, the trial court held that application of &sect; 766.118 was unconstitutionally retroactive. On appeal, the court found that applying the cap was constitutional because appellees had no vested right to a specific damage award when the injury occurred. Although appellees' injury occurred prior to the effective date of &sect; 766.118, since appellees did not file their notice and complaint, or obtain a judgment, prior to the statute's enactment, they had at most a mere expectation that they might recover an indeterminate amount of damages at an unspecified date in the future. Appellees had no vested right to a particular damage award, and thus would not suffer any due process violation by the application of &sect; 766.118 to their lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's order denying the doctor's motion to apply the &sect; 766.118 statutory cap to appellees' noneconomic damages and remanded the case for application of &sect; 766.118 to appellees' noneconomic damages award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The service charged a fee from $ 1 to $ 1.50 per one-way trip for a transportation service it provided to the laborer.

The trial court concluded that in order to comply with &sect; 448.24(1)(b), $ 1 was the maximum amount the service could have deducted from the laborer's pay and that the service violated the statute. The Supreme Court of Florida determined that &sect; 448.24(1)(b) provided a single standard of reasonable amount for evaluating labor pool transportation fees and was not unconstitutionally vague. On remand, the court reversed the trial court's finding that the local public bus rate of $ 1 for each one-way trip was the prevailing public transportation rate as the local public bus system did not provide timely site-to-site service to worksites. The service presented evidence of the costs of two other modes of public transportation. The court concluded that the service's $ 1.50 one-way trip charge did not exceed the prevailing public transportation rate, was reasonable, and did not violate &sect; 448.24(1)(b).</SPAN></P>

The court found that the bank was not required to pay those delinquent assessments. Because the declaration's plain and unambiguous language subordinating any claim for unpaid association assessments to a first mortagee's claim upon foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, it controlled and absolved the bank, as first mortgagee, from liability for any assessments accruing before it acquired the home. The association yielded any right to claim it had a superior lien to the bank's preexisting mortgage by virtue of the plain and unambiguous language of its declaration which the bank had every right to rely upon when deciding to finance the homeowner's home in the community.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court suppressed the evidence on the basis that the prescriptions constituted confidential patient records under &sect; 395.3025(4), Fla.

On appeal, the court did not reach the application of &sect;&sect; 395.3025(4) or 893.07(4) because further proceedings were necessary to determine if defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the prescriptions. In addition, the court found that there could be merit to the State's claim that defendant lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the prescriptions if they were not in fact authorized by a doctor.

The court concluded that the search was lawful under Arizona v. Gant, even though defendant was not within reach of the vehicle at the time of the search. Since the offense was theft, police could expect to find evidence and the search was justified as an incident to the arrest for the purpose of gathering evidence of the crime. It made no difference that defendant was secured at the time of the search. The court held that the reasonable belief that evidence could be found prong of Gant could be satisfied solely from the inference that could be drawn from the nature of the offense of arrest itself, and the assumption that evidence could be found at the place of the arrest. In addition, the court concluded, in the alternative, that the fruits of the search should not be excluded, even if the search was unlawful because the police relied in good faith upon the widely accepted interpretation of the law in effect at the time of the search.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a nonprofit organization and two of its members, filed an action against appellees, the Secretary of Corrections and two ministries, in which appellants sought to prohibit the Secretary from using state funds to support the ministries' substance abuse transitional housing programs for prisoners. The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) entered judgment on the pleadings for appellees. Appellants challenged the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the allegations that payments to the ministries under &sect;&sect; 944.473 and 944.4731, Fla. Stat., violated the no-aid provision of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 stated a cause of action. Appellants alleged that not only were the ministries sectarian institutions, but the programs themselves were fundamentally carried out in a sectarian manner in violation of the provision. On remand, after the facts were developed, it could be determined whether appellants had established that the programs were primarily sectarian in nature and effect under &sect; 3. The trial court properly held that appellants lacked taxpayer standing under the count challenging the downstream performance of the contracts by the ministries and the Department of Corrections' oversight of the contracts. Finally, a count where appellants sought to bar the Secretary from delegating government authority and powers to chaplains pursuant to &sect; 944.4731(6)(a) failed to state a cause of action. The state's employment of a chaplain did not violate the Establishment Clause of U.S. Const. amend. I, and the mere fact that public funds were used to pay a chaplain did not establish a cause of action under the no-aid provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's decision as to the count alleging that payments under &sect;&sect; 944.473 and 944.4731 violated the no-aid provision. It otherwise affirmed the decision. It remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insurer sought review of a non-final order from the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), which denied its motion to compel appellee insured to compel an appraisal of property damage to condominium association property owned by the insured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insured claimed that the insurer had waived its right to an appraisal by participating in the lawsuit and also by failing to comply with &sect; 627.7015, Fla. Stat. Upon review, the court determined that the application of &sect; 627.7015 did not violate Art. I, &sect; 10, Fla. Const., and applied that balancing test of Pomponio v. Claridge of Pampano Condo., Inc. Based upon an application of the balancing test, the court found that the statutory amendment subjecting commercial residential insurance policies to the mediation provisions of &sect; 627.7.015 was not an unconstitutional impairment of the existing insurance policy. Since the notice provisions were not complied with, the insurer could not demand the completion of the appraisal process as a precondition to litigation. Finally, the court found no merit to the insurer's argument that where notice of the mediation process was not supplied, &sect; 627.7015 required only that the insured was not required to participate in any contractual appraisal process of the property losses as a precondition to legal action for breach of the insurance contract for non-payment.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court found that a police officer did not have reasonable ground to believe that a child's parents might be in need of medical attention while he was attempting to reunite the child with his missing parents. There was absolutely nothing but clear, unambiguous, good intentions on the part of the officer to make sure that the child was returned to his family, and but for the fact that the illegal items were in plain view, the officer had every reasonable expectation to make sure that somebody was not, where the child indicated a parent might have been. Furthermore, all of the evidence pointed to defendant's residence as the site of the feared medical emergency. The court concluded that the case did not present a new exception, nor did it diminish the request for the sanctity of the home.

The Circuit Court for Collier County (Fla.) denied the inmate's 2008 motion for post conviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 as untimely. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate asserted that although his motion was filed beyond the normal two-year limitation period of Rule 3.850(b), it should nevertheless be given full consideration because the claim alleged is a matter of &quot;fundamental error.&quot; The appellate court found that admittedly, a generic concept of &quot;fundamental error&quot; had been mentioned extensively in opinions discussing postconviction relief. Nevertheless, &quot;fundamental error,&quot; as most commonly defined as an error for which relief could be given on direct appeal even if the issue was not preserved in the trial court, was not a basis to justify an extension of time for the filing of a postconviction motion. Indeed, an error that was actually reviewable on direct appeal as &quot;fundamental error&quot; could not be raised on postconviction review except as a matter of ineffective assistance of counsel. The grounds for an untimely motion were contained in the rule, and the court regarded those grounds as sufficient without adding an additional category of special &quot;fundamental errors&quot; for belated postconviction proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Stat. (2007) was unconstitutional as applied to the condominium.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The condominium was created in 1986. It was a mixed-use condominium consisting of 810 residential units (owned individually), 141 retail units and 259 commercial units. The commercial units were owned by the hotel. The retail units were shops on the first two floors of the condominium. When the condominium was created there was no specific statute that regulated mix-use condominiums. In 1995, &sect; 718.404 was enacted which addressed voting in mixed-use condominiums. In 2007, the statute was amended to apply retroactively. The owner requested that the voting arrangements be changed to give a majority of the board membership to the residential unit owners. Appellees asserted that &sect; 718.404(2) constituted an impairment of the obligation of contract under Art. I, &sect; 10 of the Fla. Const. The appellate court found that the voting arrangements in a condominium were of great importance, and the change imposed by &sect; 718.404(2) operated as a substantial impairment of the existing contractual relationship. The condominium complied with the applicable statutes at the time it was formed. Application of &sect; 718.404(2) would work a severe, permanent, and immediate change in those relationship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insured bought and for 13 years faithfully paid the premiums for a &quot;home health care policy&quot; which covered home &quot;primary&quot; services, those of a registered nurse or the like and &quot;secondary&quot; services, including those of non-professional providers such as a home health aide. When, however, she needed and received only the latter kind, she was denied payment. Defendant denying coverage on the ground that the policy expressly provided coverage for &quot;secondary services,&quot; such as the services at issue, only where such services were received in a week in which at least one &quot;primary&quot; service was also received. The appellate court found that &sect; 627.94071(2), Fla. Stat., specifically invalidated the policy clause which defendant relied on. By the time plaintiff rendered the services at issue to the insured &sect; 627.94071 had been in effect for some 13 years and her policy had been repeatedly &quot;renewed&quot; with full payment of all the premiums. The statute therefore applied to the present controversy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In October 2004, a warrant against defendant alleging a violation of community control issued in Broward County, and in December 2004, defendant was arrested in Miami-Dade County on unrelated charges. In 2006, having remained incarcerated in Miami-Dade, he was sentenced to time served for the Miami-Dade charges. He was later transported to Broward County to face the charges there. Defendant argued that he was arrested on the Broward warrant while he was in the Miami-Dade County Jail and that he was entitled to credit from this date. The court stated that under &sect; 921.16(1), Fla. Stat. (2004), because the Broward case was charged separately from the Miami-Dade cases, the Broward sentence was consecutive to the Miami-Dade sentences. A defendant who was held on multiple offenses was entitled to jail credit from the date of arrest on a foreign county's warrant only where concurrent sentences were imposed or where the foreign county's warrant was the sole basis for the defendant's incarceration. Defendant was not entitled to credit from the date of his arrest on the Broward warrant because the sentence he received was consecutive, not concurrent, with the Miami-Dade sentences.</SPAN></P>

It sought a writ of certiorari quashing an interlocutory order of the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida), which determined that it vehicle was a public hazard pursuant to &sect; 69.081.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal held that the mother's motion should have been summarily denied. Section 69.081 was applicable only if the trial court entered a confidentiality order or if there was a pending motion by the defending party for a confidentiality order, &sect; 69.081(3). The trial court never entered a confidentiality order, and the manufacturer did not file a pending motion for a confidentiality order. The mother was bound by a confidentiality order entered by a United States District Court. The Act did not override the terms of the federal court order. The mother failed to provide the manufacturer with adequate notice of documents she sought to have examined in camera pursuant to the Act and witnesses and documents that she would rely upon at the noticed evidentiary hearing to demonstrate that the vehicle was a public hazard. The trial court did not conduct a formal, trial-like evidentiary hearing at which each side was permitted to offer evidence and make objections. The mother's motion and the order were overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The JAC petitioned the court for a writ of certiorari to quash a circuit court order awarding interim compensation and costs to an attorney appointed to represent the defendant in a prosecution for a capital felony. The JAC challenged the circuit court's order because it awarded compensation for the attorney's services at the rate of $ 125 per hour instead of $ 100 per hour. Because the circuit court departed from the essential requirements of law by approving compensation that exceeded the applicable statutory limit of $ 100 per hour, the appellate court granted the petition. Section 27.5304(12)(d), Fla. Stat. (2007) controlled the hourly rate payable for the attorney's services. The new &sect; 27.5304(12), Fla. Stat. became effective on May 24, 2007 and predated the attorney's appointment by five weeks. The attorney also did not present any evidence during a hearing that it was necessary to pay an attorney an hourly rate in excess of the authorized rate in order to obtain qualified counsel and he voluntarily accepted the appointment and signed a contract with the JAC. That contract limited his compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court granted the petition and quashed the circuit court's order to the extent that it used an incorrect hourly rate to calculate the interim fee to award the attorney.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee news organizations sought to compel appellant college athletic association, which was investigating allegations that a learning specialist and a tutor had provided improper assistance to student athletes at a public university, to disclose certain documents under Ch. 119, Fla. Stat. The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) ordered appellant to disclose the documents. Appellant challenged the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the transcript of a hearing conducted by appellant and a response of appellant's infractions committee, which had been made available on a secure website to university lawyers, were public records under &sect; 119.011(12), Fla. Stat. Although these documents were prepared and maintained by a private organization, they were &quot;received&quot; by agents of a public agency and used in connection with public business. The documents were not protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1232g, and thus did not fall within &sect; 1006.52(1), Fla. Stat. The records pertained to allegations of misconduct by the university's athletic department and only tangentially related to the students who benefitted from that misconduct. Moreover, the records did not reveal the identity of the students. Finally, the public records law did not violate appellant's rights under the dormant commerce clause in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, as the negligible impact it might have on interstate commerce clearly did not outweigh the goal of ensuring open government. The law did not impair appellant's freedom of expression or its freedom of association under U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent patient filed a medical malpractice action against petitioners, a cardiologist and a clinic. Petitioners filed a motion to dismiss the action on the ground that the expert pre-suit corroborating affidavit did not satisfy &sect; 766.102, Fla. Stat. (2007) and &sect; 766.202, Fla. Stat. (2007). A Florida trial court denied the motion, and petitioners sought a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners argued that the affidavit submitted by respondent was insufficient because the affiant, who was board certified as both a family and emergency physician, was not an expert in cardiology. The court first held that the action was appropriate for certiorari review. Florida courts had uniformly recognized the availability of certiorari review in cases where the pre-suit notice requirements of ch. 766, Fla. Stat., had not been met. Next, the effect of the 2003 amendment to &sect; 766.102 was that &quot;training, experience and knowledge&quot; in the defendant's specialty no longer rendered any health care provider competent to give a pre-suit corroborating affidavit. Rather, the expert witness had to specialize in the same specialty as the defendant or specialize in a similar specialty that included the evaluation, diagnosis, or treatment of the medical condition at issue. Emergency or family medicine did not qualify as a specialty similar to cardiology. They did not require any specifically focused training in cardiology. The effect of the trial court's ruling was to elevate generalists to the level of an expert not only in their own field of medicine but in every field and specialty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the petition for certiorari. It quashed the decision of the trial court denying the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, licensed drivers, sought review of a final judgment from the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), which dismissed their amended complaint with prejudice for failing to state a cause of action against appellees, Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles and its executive director (Department). The drivers' challenged the Department's authority to required the to install an ignition interlock device upon their cars.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The drivers had been convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) and sentenced before July 1, 2005. After such date, the Department, pursuant to &sect; 322.2715, Fla. Stat. (2005), was authorized to require the installation of a ignition interlock device upon a driver's car who had been convicted of DUI if the sentencing court failed to do so. Regardless of the fact that &sect; 322.2715 did not have retroactive effect, the Department issued letters to all DUI offenders including those convicted before the specified date. On appeal, the court determined that the trial court erred in dismissing the federal claims by finding that the drivers had not shown the deprivation of a property right protected by 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because the trial court had to conduct further fact finding to determine if Florida law recognized a driver's license as a property right under the facts. In addition, the Department's ultimatum to the drivers to either install the device or forfeit their drivers' licenses could have implicated property interest cognizable in Florida and thus, there may have been a due process violation and the state prohibition against unauthorized administrative penalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment with regard to the count alleging &sect; 1983 violations, reversed the judgment with regard to the state due process claim and unauthorized administrative penalties, remanded the matter to consider such matters, and affirmed the remainder of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

As part of discovery the patient sought all adverse incident reports, the entire credentialing files for the two doctors, and a blank application for medical staff privileges.

In addition, because the challenged provisions of the contract at issue were expressly tied to the viability of such provisions under the prevailing law, the hospital's arguments under the Contract Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, were meritless. However, the trial court departed from the essential requirements of the law in ordering production of the doctors' credentials because there was no established adverse medical incident to which the documents of the doctors' raining related.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, tenants in a mobile home park owned by defendant city, brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the city in the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida). The tenants sought to stop the city from evicting them based on &sect; 723.083, Fla. Stat. (2007). The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment, and the tenants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 723.083 provided that a municipality could not take official action to rezone or change the use of a mobile home park without ascertaining that there were adequate facilities to which the mobile home owners could relocate. However, the city owned the park in its proprietary capacity, not as a municipality. The court held that &sect; 723.061(3), Fla. Stat. (2007), specifically provided that &sect; 723.083 did not apply when a mobile home park owner gave notice of eviction under section 723.061. Moreover, the service of a notice of eviction by the mobile home park owner, even if it is a municipality, was not an &quot;official action&quot; as required under &sect; 723.083. The court also rejected the tenants' equal protection challenge to the statutes. The city, by purchasing the property, placed itself in the position of a mobile home park owner by definition under chapter 723. The mobile home owners had been treated the same under the law as they would have by any private mobile home park owner. The city, as the mobile home park owner, was treated the same under the law as any private mobile home park owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The party had declined to recognize the candidates as executive committee members because of their failure to file a party loyalty oath before the qualifying deadline. On appeal, the court found that the party had the right to establish its own separate form of loyalty oath, and a filing deadline for that form, so long as it made the new rule and new form reasonably and timely known and available to the prospective candidates. In addition, such right did not excuse the candidates' obligations to comply with &sect;&sect; 103.091(4) and 99.021, Fla. Stat. (2008), and of course the party could not require the supervisor of elections to monitor compliance with any of the party's own rules.  The court agreed with the trial court found the party's notices regarding the new form and deadline were too little and too late. Finally, the court found that the party was estopped, by virtue of its knowledge of the alleged ineligibility of the candidates before the election, to await the outcome of the election and the commencement of a lawsuit by the candidates before submitting the alleged ineligibility to a court for resolution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers filed an action in the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), challenging the constitutional validity of Art. VII, &sect; 4(c), Fla. Const., commonly known as the &quot;Save Our Homes&quot; Amendment. The taxpayers argued that &sect; 4(c) violated the Equal Protection Clause, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and the Commerce Clause. The trial court granted judgment for defendant tax collectors, and the taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court rejected some defendants' contention that the taxpayers' action was barred by the 60-day time limitation for filing actions in &sect; 194.171, Fla. Stat., because that limitation only applied to actions contesting the tax assessments on their property. Section 194.171 did not apply in this case, in which the taxpayers challenged certain tax provisions, not an assessment of any particular property. The court rejected the taxpayers' contention that &sect; 4(c) and its implementing statute,&nbsp;&sect; 193.155, Fla. Stat., were unconstitutional as having a discriminatory effect on nonresidents of Florida. The homestead exemption and the 3 percent tax cap applied only to property that was used as a primary residence and therefore qualified as a homestead. A Florida resident who owned vacation property or business properly in the state would not be entitled to claim any tax benefit under &sect; 4(c) and would be in the same position with respect to that property as a nonresident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant investment company appealed from the final summary judgment of the Circuit Court for Duval County, Fla., which invalidated a tax deed and denied the company's motions for summary judgment against appellees, a property manager and other corporations. The investment company also appealed a corrected final judgment to the investment company for damages in favor of itself and against one corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the property manager failed to pay its 1997 ad valorem taxes, a city issued a tax certificate, which the investment company purchased in April 1998. In April 2000, after the property manager failed to redeem the tax certificate within two years, the investment company applied for a tax deed under Fla. Stat. &sect; 197.502(1) (1999). The instant court found dispositive the trial court's failure to rule within the narrow scope of the determination required by the Florida Supreme Court. The sole question within the scope of previous remands was whether the 2000 assessment roll was available to the clerk of the court when it mailed the notices of sale and, if so, whether property manager's alleged &quot;new&quot; address was contained therein. The discovery undertaken and filed in the trial court in connection with investment company's motion for summary judgment demonstrated conclusively that no updated assessment roll existed at the time the notices of sale were mailed in the instant case. The latest assessment roll available to the tax collector in compiling the list of those to whom notices of a tax sale were to be sent, and at what address, was, in fact, the roll certified in October 1999.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court concluded that a request for Amendment 7 materials were not an ordinary discovery request which can be subjected to overbreadth, irrelevance, or burdensomeness objections. Further, a litigant in a medical malpractice case clearly qualified as a patient under the Amendment and was entitled to discover the information. In addition, nothing in the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (Act), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11101, et seq., preempted Florida from removing confidentiality or discovery protections that were not required by the Act. Finally, the Amendment was not unconstitutional under U.S. Const. art.

Stat. (2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney was involuntarily appointed to represent the defendant. The appellate court reviewed the denial of his motion to withdraw pursuant to a petition for a writ of certiorari because his injury from his motion's improper denial could not be remedied on appeal. The trial court departed from essential requirements of the law in denying his motion because he showed grounds to withdraw under R. Regulating Fla. Bar 4-6.2. First, under R. Regulating Fla. Bar 4-6.2(a), the involuntary representation would likely result in violations of R. Regulating Fla. Bar 4-1.1, 4-1.2(a), 4-1.3, and 4-1.4 because it would make him unable to competently represent existing clients. Second, under R. Regulating Fla. Bar. 4-6.2(b), the extraordinary time and effort required to represent the defendant effectively, and the minimal and uncertain compensation offered, imposed an unreasonable financial burden. The rate at which he was ordered to be compensated, while more than allowed by &sect; 27.5304(12)(d), Fla. Stat.

The agency filed a petition for termination of parental rights, and it alleged that the BF's consent was not required due to his lack of compliance with &sect; 63.062(2)(b)2 and (3). The trial court granted summary judgment to the agency and the BM upon finding that the BF failed to comply with the statutory requirements. On appeal, the court held that it was error to grant summary judgment to appellees. The trial court's determination that the BF had to comply with both &sect; 63.062(2)(b)(2) and (3) was error. Further, as only a substantial compliance standard applied to &sect; 63.062(2)(b)(2), the BF met his obligations by filing the notarized letter and thereafter filing an affidavit to correct the defect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated actions arising from a medical malpractice action, petitioner medical center filed two separate petitions for certiorari seeking review of two discovery orders requiring it to produce certain records of adverse medical incidents and doctors' training, among other information and documentation. Respondents, a hospital, and a husband and wife, had made the requests during the course of the litigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents contended that while undergoing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, one of petitioner's doctors severed a bile duct and that the surgery to repair the severe was performed improperly. Petitioners had moved to quash the discovery requests and sought protective orders, which the trial court denied. Addressing petitioner's challenges, the court held that petitioner was not prohibited from filing a privilege log. The court further held that the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11101 et seq., did not preempt Amendment 7, Art. X, &sect; 25, Fla. Const., with regard to the disclosure of adverse medical incidents as requested. Therefore, the trial court did not err as to that ruling. The court further held that Amendment 7 did not violate the Contract Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, and that the plain language of the hospital's confidentiality bylaws expressly limited its guarantee of confidentiality to the extent permitted by law, thus, no contract right was impaired. The court did agree that there was no identifiable adverse medical incident in the records of the doctors' training to perform the procedure that injured the wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted, in part, the portion of the petitions seeking a writ of certiorari to quash the ruling requiring the production of evidence of the doctors' training. Otherwise, the court affirmed the petitions in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After holding informal hearings, appellee Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering, denied applications for a slot machine occupational license filed by appellants, a corporation and its controlling officer. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Division denied the applications because 1) the officer pled nolo contendere to felony charges of production of marijuana and possession of over 20 grams of marijuana, which were disqualifying convictions under &sect; 551.107(6)(a), Fla. Stat. (2007); and 2) he was able to control the corporation. Appellants asserted that his convictions were not disqualifying under &sect; 551.107(6)(a) because they did not involve &quot;arson; trafficking in, conspiracy to traffic in, smuggling, importing, conspiracy to smuggle or import, or delivery, sale, or distribution of a controlled substance; racketeering; or a crime involving a lack of good moral character.&quot; The appellate court held that this phrase modified only the last antecedent, &quot;an offense in any other State that would be a felony under the laws of this State,&quot; and that any Florida felony conviction was disqualifying under &sect; 51.107(6)(a). Contrary to appellants' assertion, there was a rational basis for disqualifying persons who pled nolo contendere to felony offenses from licensure under &sect; 551.107(6)(a), as gambling historically was susceptible to criminal influences. Thus, there was no substantive due process or equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee counties brought suit against appellant, seeking a declaratory judgment that Ch. 2007-62, &sect; 19, Laws of Fla., &sect; 27.511, Fla. Stat. (2007) was unconstitutional. The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) entered an order of final summary judgment in favor of the counties. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The counties argued that Art. V, &sect; 14, Fla. Const. limited the legislature's intent and imposed funding responsibility for court-appointed counsel wholly upon the state, and that it was beyond the legislature's power to enact a statute that attempted to modify or enlarge a constitutionally defined term. The appellate court found that, because there was no significant legal difference between the Regional Conflict Counsel system and the previous private court-appointed counsel system, ch. 2007-62, &sect; 19, Laws of Fla., &sect; 27.511, Fla. Stat. (2007), which attempted to require the counties to fund Regional Conflict Counsel's overhead costs, was inconsistent with the Constitution's language and the framers' intent. Art. V, &sect; 14, Fla. Const. clearly required the state to fund such costs. Further, ch. 2007-62, &sect; 19, Laws of Fla., &sect; 27.511, Fla. Stat. (2007), provided no indication that the legislature ever determined that creation of the office fulfilled an important state interest, so it also violated Art. VII, &sect; 18(a), Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>
