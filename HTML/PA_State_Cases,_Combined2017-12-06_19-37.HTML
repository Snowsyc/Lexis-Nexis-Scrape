<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board of Supervisors and taxpayers appealed an order by the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County (Pennsylvania) which granted a request for a curative amendment to a Sugarloaf Township Zoning Ordinance filed by the property owners. At issue was whether the Ordinance, which permitted a quarry only in one zoning district where all minerals had been mined that could be economically extracted, was consistent with 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10603(i).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners originally requested a variance as to three tracts of land in an area which had been rezoned. The Board dismissed the challenge to the validity of the Ordinance and denied the application and petition for a curative amendment filed by the property owners. On appeal, the trial court took additional testimony on the suitability of the site for mining, which the Board had not allowed to be presented. The trial court reversed the Board. The appellate court held it was within the trial court's discretion to allow additional testimony as the Board incorrectly precluded the property owners from presenting evidence with regard to the suitability of the proposed site. That prevented the Board from considering both the credibility and suitability issues. Although the trial court relied heavily on the fact that there were no minerals to be recovered in the I-1 District in determining that the Ordinance was invalid, it failed to note that the underlying reason for that was the minerals had already been extracted. Just because the I-1 District was mined out did not mean that the Ordinance was exclusionary or unconstitutional. The Ordinance was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant borough appealed a judgment entered by the Common Pleas Court of the County of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) that sustained the statutory appeal of appellee top-scoring applicant, thereby requiring his appointment as captain of the borough fire department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the former promotion provision of the Pennsylvania Second Class County Code, former 16 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4516, required a civil service commission to promote the highest scoring applicant on a written examination. The promotion provision (&sect; 1184) of the Pennsylvania Borough Code, specifically, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46184(a), was nearly identical to former &sect; 4516. The plain language of &sect; 1184, which expressly addressed original positions, commanded the conclusion that the ability to select from a list of the highest scoring applicants was limited to original positions, not to promotions. The borough's position that it had discretion to choose from the top three scoring applicants was contrary to the rules of statutory construction, as it would render &sect; 1188 (53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46188) of the Pennsylvania Borough Code superfluous. Promotion was not synonymous with original appointments or vacancies. The borough had to appoint the top-scoring applicant to the position of captain of the borough fire department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an owner and his sexually oriented business, appealed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lawrence County (Pennsylvania), which suspended the business's license for one year. The trial court affirmed the decision of appellee township board of supervisors that the business violated a township ordinance that forbid sexually oriented businesses from conducting business on a &quot;state recognized holiday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was whether the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague because it did not identify what constituted a &quot;state recognized holiday.&quot; The appellate court concluded that the business's due process challenge was not barred by the doctrine of res judicata because the constitutionality of Pulaski Township, Pa., Ordinance No. 2000-5-22, &sect; 18 (2000) was not at issue in a previous case where the business challenged a different phrase and a different provision of the ordinance. In addition, the business was expressly authorized to use the statutory procedure in 2 Pa.C.S. &sect; 753(a) to litigate the constitutionality of the ordinance. The ordinance was unconstitutionally vague because it provided no guidance on how to determine whether a particular day was a &quot;state recognized holiday.&quot; The phrase &quot;state recognized holiday&quot; could mean a day when state offices were closed or a day shown as a holiday on a printed calendar. The ordinance did not explain how to determine whether a holiday was &quot;state recognized,&quot; and it did not direct that 44 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11 was dispositive of which days of the year were to be considered &quot;state recognized holidays.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner physician, who began treating a patient after he entered into a romantic and sexual relationship with her, sought review of an order of respondent State Board of Medicine (Pennsylvania), which suspended his medical license for two years and required him to take a continuing education course on sexual boundary issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected petitoner's argument that 49 Pa. Code &sect; 16.110(b) and (c), which prohibited a physician's sexual behavior with a patient other than his spouse, violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 26. There was nothing irrational about the Board drawing a line between physicians treating spouses and treating non-spouses. Next, the Board properly applied &sect; 16.110(b) as written. The regulation did not address when the relationship between patient and physician started, but only whether there was a current or former patient/physician relationship. Next, the Board found that there was substantial evidence presented to show that petitioner interfered with a psychiatrist's treatment of the patient, amounting to unprofessional conduct under 63 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 422.41. The Board based its decision on evidence that petitioner did not coordinate the patient's prescriptions with the psychiatrist when there was a potential for harmful drug interaction. Finally, without evidence indicating that a two-year suspension was made in bad faith, fraudulent, capricious or an abuse of power, the court would not overturn the Board's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Board's order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation (DOT), filed preliminary objections in opposition to a petition for review filed in the original jurisdiction of the appellate court (Pennsylvania) by petitioners, two contractors, including contractor one, and their officers (contractors), which alleged that the DOT's debarment proceedings against contractor one were improper and without authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After two employees of contractor one pled guilty to taking kickbacks from a minority business enterprise, the contractors were notified of an intent to debar them under Management Directive 215.9. The appellate court held that the DOT had promulgated 67 Pa. Code &sect; 457.13 and &sect; 457.14 relating to suspension or debarment and the debarment appeals procedure. Whether the Management Directive was a regulation was not helpful in deciding the case. The Executive Order/Contractor Responsibility Program at 4 Pa. Code &sect;&sect; 7-501-7-505, did not discuss debarment, but spoke in general terms about contractor responsibility. The Contractor Responsibility Program did not track Executive Order 1990-3. Thus, the DOT's preliminary objections were denied. The claim that contractor one did not exhaust its administrative remedies because the DOT had not yet addressed its challenges to the interpretation and application of the  debarment procedures, was rejected. Because contractor one was challenging the validity of debarment procedures/regulations and the outcome would directly and immediately affect the day to day business of its operations, it did not have to exhaust its administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner councilpersons sued respondents house, senate, and association, seeking a declaration that each of seven gun ordinances may have taken immediate effect, that 53 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6120 was unconstitutional, and that 53 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6120 did not apply to any of the ordinances to the extent they did not regulate the carrying or transporting of firearms. The house, the senate, and the association filed preliminary objections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The house filed preliminary objections based on ripeness and failure to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted.

The association filed preliminary objections based on lack of standing, res judicata, scandalous, or impertinent information, non-justiciability, and failure to state a claim. The court found that regulation of firearms was a matter of concern in all of Pennsylvania, and the general assembly, not city councils, was the proper forum for the imposition of such regulation. Both 53 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6120 and binding precedent made clear regulation of firearms was an area of statewide concern over which the general assembly had assumed sole regulatory power. Where a state statute preempted local governments from imposing regulations on a subject, any ordinances to the contrary were unenforceable. 53 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6120 clearly preempted local governments from regulating the lawful ownership, possession, and transportation of firearms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed, pro se, from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County (Pennsylvania) which denied his motion for the return of a handgun.

The trial court concluded, however, that defendant was prohibited from possessing a firearm under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 921-931. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's request for the appointment of counsel. It also rejected defendant's argument that counterfeiting was a &quot;business offense&quot; for purposes of the Federal Gun Control Act. The plain language of the counterfeiting statute revealed that the government was not required to prove an effect on consumers or competition as an element of the offense. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for return of property. Defendant could not establish that he was entitled to &quot;lawful&quot; possession of the handgun because, under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 922, defendant was prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The AG contended that the Solid Waste Management Act, 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6018.101-1003, and the Nutrient Management Act, 3 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 501-522, established uniform statewide standards for the regulation of the application of sewage sludge and other such nutrients to land, which precluded the East Brunswick Township Sewage Sludge Ordinance's inconsistent regulation of such activities. The subject ordinance allowed individuals to apply sewage sludge after obtaining a permit, but prohibited any corporation from doing so. The court concluded that Act 38, Chapter Three of the Pennsylvania Agriculture Code, was constitutional and did not exempt the ordinance from its prohibitory terms. The court also found that the AG had standing, despite the township's claim that the AG was doing battle on behalf of a private corporation, noting that 3 Pa.C.S. &sect; 313(b) expressly authorized the AG's action. While the court concluded that summary relief was unavailable in cases of first impression, it did concluded that the AG was not entitled to summary relief, finding it unclear that application of sewage sludge was a &quot;normal agricultural operation&quot; and thus, that the AG was entitled to judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after he was found using a sound system composed of two loudspeakers, an amplifier, and a microphone outside an abortion clinic. The appeals court found there was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction. Defendant himself characterized the sound system as &quot;a portable sound system,&quot; and an officer testified that the noise created by that system was clearly audible more than seventy-five feet away. As a result, defendant's claim that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence and that it was contrary to law was without merit. He failed to establish that enforcement of the Ordinance substantially burdened his right to the free exercise of religion in violation of &sect; 4 (71 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2404) of the Pennsylvania Religious Freedom Protection Act, 71 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2401-2407. Defendant never testified that his activities of counseling and preaching to people approaching the clinic constituted activities fundamental to his religion as provided in &sect; 3 (71 Pa. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that he was not obligated to pay income taxes because he did not engage in taxable activities. The taxpayer earned compensation income from his company, and may or may not have earned income from interest, dividends, or gains from asset sales. The taxpayer argued that he was not subject to the income tax because he was not a federal employee. The court held that, under 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7302(a), persons were subject to income tax if they were &quot;resident individuals.&quot; No reference, explicit or implied, was made in this section that meant that the state income tax applied only to federal employees. Contrary to the taxpayer's argument, the Sixteenth Amendment did not bar taxation of income obtained through the use of personal property. The Sixteenth Amendment only related to the taxing power of Congress, and not that of the states. Finally, since the taxpayer received compensation income during the tax years at issue, he received a privilege for which he was subject to the income tax. The taxpayer was a &quot;resident individual&quot; as defined by 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7301(p), and thus, was subject to the income tax pursuant to 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7302(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Ann. &sect; 6-692 decided to eliminate respondent district's high school program, and students in respondent district enrolled in high schools in petitioners. The court granted summary relief to respondents. Because &sect; 16-1607.1(a) had criteria related rationally to the objective of identifying school districts with educational shortcomings and providing assistance if necessary when a district eliminated its high school program, that provision did not violate Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32, which was similar to equal protection. Section 11-1113(b.2) was rationally related to a legitimate state interest of ensuring that qualified teachers remained in public school service. No unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority had occurred under Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 as the basic policy choices were made by the legislature concerning geographic proximity and dispersal of students among two or more other districts.</SPAN></P>

It sought injunctive relief and a declaration that the DCNR's decision prohibiting it from conducting regular whitewater rafting trips violated due process. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The camp conducted whitewater rafting trips on a river that passed through a state park. In 2001, the DCNR determined that the camp was engaged in commercial activity as an unlicensed outfitter and therefore under 17 Pa. Code &sect; 11.209(a)(5) could not guide trips on the river unless it used a licensed commercial outfitter. The court stated that the camp conceded that it was engaged in commercial activity; therefore, the initial inquiry had to be whether the DCNR was interpreting and applying the regulation to the camp in a reasonable manner. The court held that it was. The park here was a state park, and the DCNR had the authority under 71 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1340.313(a) to regulate activities within its own parks. Section 11.209(a)(5) specifically and unequivocally prohibited all commercial activity in any state park without the written permission of the DCNR. Thus, the camp was precluded from engaging in commercial activity inside the state park without the DCNR's written permission as a matter of regulatory interpretation. Because of this conclusion, it was unnecessary to address the camp's constitutional arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the DCNR's cross-motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in its favor. It denied the camp's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, three unions, filed a petition for review by way of a declaratory judgment that respondents, the Commonwealth and various officials, were not &quot;legally required&quot; under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 24 and the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 201-219, to agree on a framework for a general appropriation act for the current fiscal year in order to avoid Commonwealth employees being furloughed. Summary relief was sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The unions represented thousands of Commonwealth employees who were not exempt from the wage and hour requirements of the FLSA. Such employees, deemed FLSA covered non-critical employees, would have allegedly been furloughed on the first date of the new fiscal year if the Governor and General Assembly had not agreed on the framework for a general appropriation act for the 2008-2009 fiscal year by the day prior thereto. The unions sought a declaration that the furlough plan was not legally required, as claimed by the Governor, if a budget was not in place in a timely manner. They relied on their claim that the FLSA superseded Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 24, such that there was no impediment to the Governor's continued compensation of FLSA-covered employees who worked during a budget impasse. The court initially noted that although technically moot, the matter was capable of repetition, and that the unions' matter was properly raised under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7541(a). It held that there was no conflict between the FLSA and &sect; 24, such that the FLSA did not preempt &sect; 24 and allow payment of employee wages without the necessary budgeted appropriation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the unions' request for a declaration that the Governor could have raided the State's treasury to make payroll, and it denied the Governor's request for a declaration regarding the use of treasury funds without an appropriation. The court granted the Governor's request to declare that he was authorized to furlough employees due to lack of funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a homeowners association and its constituent property owners, sought review of a decision of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Allegheny (Pennsylvania), which denied their preliminary objections to appellee property owner's request for appointment of a board of viewers to open a private road under the Private Road Act, 36 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 1781-2891, so that his landlocked parcels could have access to the nearest public road.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants claimed that the Private Road Act was an unconstitutional taking of property for a private purpose in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 10. On an interlocutory appeal based on the public importance of the issue, the court affirmed. After reviewing the legislative history of the Private Road Act, the court found that private roads were considered part of the public road system; because six percent was given to the original landowners, an incorporeal burden was created on all the Commonwealth's land that, in accordance with the Act, private roads were to be allowed to be laid when necessary. Even if the court used a traditional takings analysis to determine the constitutionality of the Act, a taking would be seen as having a public purpose where the real or fundamental purpose behind a taking primarily benefited the public; because, as the trial court held, the public would be served by allowing access to property that would not be otherwise used, the Act did not violate either the federal or state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department's Board of Appeals returned, for lack of jurisdiction, the slot machine licensee's petition alleging that 61 Pa. Code &sect; 1001.6(d)(3) and the Department's letters unfairly calculated the share of general administrative costs gaming facilities paid based on a pro rata share of revenues and that the local share assessment under 61 Pa. Code &sect; 1001.5(c)(1) was inconsistent with the Gaming Act, 4 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1101-1904. The Department's Board of Finance and Revenue (BFR) returned the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The court sustained the Department's preliminary objections and dismissed the licensee's petition for review. The court did not have original jurisdiction, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 761(a)(1), over the pre-enforcement challenge because the licensee was not yet operating, the Department had not yet calculated its gross terminal revenue or levied an assessment, and there was a full and complete adequate administrative remedy involving the refund of funds found to be excessive. The court denied the motion to quash the appeal, which the BFR dismissed, and held that the BFR lacked the authority to hear pre-enforcement challenges to departmental policies or regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the governor and the secretary of the Commonwealth and the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, made preliminary objections to petitioner's first amended petition for review, complaint in declaratory judgment, and bill of equity (petition), which challenged the constitutionality of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 6322 and 6355 regarding the transfer of criminal matters from adult to juvenile court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1991, petitioner, who was 15 years old, was arrested for the murder and robbery of a taxi driver. Petitioner was tried as an adult after an unsuccessful attempt to be tried as a juvenile and was convicted in 1992 of criminal homicide/felony murder, criminal conspiracy, and robbery. The conviction was affirmed on direct appeal in 1994. Requests for relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9541-9546, were also unsuccessful. The court sustained in part and overruled in part the preliminary objections. While the governor and secretary were properly served via certified mail pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1514(c) with the petition for review, they were not indispensable parties under Pa.R.C.P. No. 235 and Pa.R.A.P. 521 as, inter alia, the governor only signed the amendments into law. Petitioner had no standing to bring the action under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1028(a)(5) as he did not commit his October 1991 delinquent act on or after the effective date of 1995 Pa. Laws 1127 (Act 33), 120 days from November 17, 1995, and he was not convicted under its provisions. Based on precedent, the same provisions were upheld against a constitutional challenge, so the petition was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the preliminary objections as to service on the governor and the secretary but sustained the objections to inclusion of the governor and the secretary as indispensable parties, petitioner's standing, and failure to state a claim. The petition was dismissed on the basis that the law would not permit a recovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Pennsylvania State Police, Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement (Bureau) challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas Court of the County of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), which granted appellee applicant's appeal and reversed the decision of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board to sustain citations the Bureau issued to the applicant for violating &sect; 407 of the Liquor Code, 47 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4-407 (2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Philadelphia City Council denied the applicant's request for an off premises sales permit for its restaurant. The Bureau issued citations to the application for violating &sect; 4-407 (2005), alleging that the applicant sold malt or brewed beverages for consumption off premises. The Board sustained the citations. The trial court ruled that it could not enforce citations that were issued under a procedure that was considered unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the trial court properly found that the citations were not valid because they were based upon the unconstitutional process in &sect; 4-407 (2005). Section 4-407 (2005) was unconstitutional from the date of its enactment, July 7, 2005, which was prior to the date of the alleged offenses. Therefore, the controlling law on the date of the offenses was &sect; 407 of the Liquor Code, 47 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4-407 (2004), by virtue of which no permit was required to sell one bottle or one can of beer to take out. Because the applicant appealed the Board's decision to the trial court, the trial court was correct in relying upon the fact that the permit process had been found unconstitutional prior to making a decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner dentist filed an amended petition for review against respondent Department of State and State Board of Dentistry members, alleging, inter alia, negligence and seeking mandamus and declaratory relief from the Board's order assessing a fine. The Department filed preliminary objections to the court's original jurisdiction. After the fine order was affirmed, resolution of the preliminary objections was assigned to the panel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court lacked original jurisdiction over the negligence claim where the complaint included a distinct count seeking money damages based upon the Board's alleged negligence, and under applicable case law, the court could not address either the merits of the count or the threshold question of whether the Board enjoyed sovereign immunity. The dentist was not entitled to injunctive relief as the Board had altered its procedures for requests to extend the time to comply with the continuing education requirements and the dentist had not shown that the changes did not resolve the difficulties he had allegedly encountered. The preliminary objection to the mandamus count was sustained as the dentist failed to show that he was entitled to such relief. The court lacked jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action for similar reasons. Moreover, the appellate decision had answered the questions that the request raised. Finally, the court lacked jurisdiction over the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12131 et seq., claim as the relief sought was limited to money damages and attorney fees, and such relief was not encompassed within the court's original jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The preliminary objections to the injunctive, mandamus, and declaratory relief requests were sustained.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned the property at issue, which was being used by him as a strip club. The property was located in a redevelopment district, which the city's planning commission had certified as blighted. The landowner's preliminary objections to the declaration primarily asserted that the authority condemned the property for the private, for-profit use of a redeveloper. The court held that the fact that the authority selected the redeveloper and negotiated with him a contract for the sale and redevelopment of the property before the condemnation did not establish the landowner's claim that the authority took the property for the redeveloper's private use. The court noted that the fact that the redeveloper may profit from the sale and redevelopment of the property did not negate the redeveloper's contribution to the elimination of the blight in the redevelopment area and there was no support for the landowner's conjecture that the public benefit was only incidental to the redeveloper's profits. The court also found that the landowner waived several issues on appeal by not raising them in his preliminary objections.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the complaint under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 6601-6608.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed a civil rights complaint, alleging that the mail policy at the correction institution where he was incarcerated violated his constitutional right to read books that posed no threat to others. His request to proceed in forma pauperis was denied and the complaint was dismissed as frivolous under Pa.R.C.P. No. 240(j). On appeal, the dismissal was reversed. The trial court, on remand, found that 14 of the inmate's prior civil prison condition actions were dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or not stating a viable claim under &sect; 6602(f) of the PLRA, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6602(f). Accordingly, it dismissed his complaint under &sect; 6602(f)(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner and the advertising company contended that the objectors, who were associations or individuals, were not aggrieved persons and, thus, lacked standing to appeal the ZBA's decision under &sect; 17.1 of the Pennsylvania First Class City Home Rule Act, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13131.1, because the objectors could not point to any direct, immediate, or substantial interest that was adversely affected by the ZBA's decision. The objectors contended that the associations had standing because of their long-standing purpose of promoting community development and opposing illegal signs. They also asserted that they had standing to appeal the ZBA decision merely because they all were present at and participated in one or more of the hearings before the ZBA. Finally, they argued that they had standing as aggrieved persons either because the associations' boundaries covered the district where the sign was to be erected or because members of the associations had homes in the general area. On appeal, the court found that the objectors' appeal was properly quashed because neither the associations nor the individuals showed that they were aggrieved by the ZBA's decision to allow the sign.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former employee voluntarily resigned her employment to follow her domestic partner to another state because she was not able financially to maintain two separate households. Her domestic partner moved to the other state to be near her son, who had a learning disability, and to seek a less stressful environment. An unemployment compensation benefits referee questioned her about her reasons for quitting, and gave her an opportunity to call and to question her witness. The referee then found her ineligible for benefits under 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 802(b) because she had not proven that her voluntary separation was due to a necessitous and compelling cause. The Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (Board) affirmed. The appellate court found although the former employee raised some constitutional issues, the case could be decided on nonconstitutional grounds because the former employee simply failed to meet her burden of showing that her unemployment was due to a necessitous and compelling cause. It also disagreed with her claim that the Board should have remanded her case for further factual development because the record did not show any reason to remand the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania) denied a motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed appellant deputy mayor's declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that a trust holding municipal funds for retiree medical benefits fell within the meaning of &quot;pension and retirement funds&quot; under the Pennsylvania Probate, Estates, and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7301. The deputy mayor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipality was obligated to pay medical benefits for its retirees after they retired. To fund those obligations, it created a trust to set aside funds to pay medical benefits to its employees after they retired. To keep borrowing costs low, the municipality sought to invest the trust funds according to the Pennsylvania Probate, Estates, and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7301 et seq. (PEF Code), which would allow investment in corporate stocks and bonds. Appellee mayor did not believe that the trust funds could be invested that way. The deputy mayor sought a declaration that the trust funded a &quot;municipal pension or retirement plan&quot; under 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7301. After the trial court agreed with the mayor's position, the appellate court noted that the PEF Code did not define &quot;municipal pension plan&quot; or &quot;retirement plan.&quot; It found, however, that statutory definitions in the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 895.101 et seq., and the treatment of retiree medical benefits in other contexts supported the conclusion that a trust funding retiree medical benefits was a pension or retirement plan pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7301.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected respondent's argument that petitioner's claims should have been raised initially in a grievance. 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6603(a) applied only when prison litigation alleged in whole or in part a violation of federal law, which was not the case here. Next, the policy was not a regulation as defined in 45 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1102(12). It did not establish a standard of conduct that had the force of law, and it left the Department free to exercise discretion to follow or not follow the policy in an individual case. Thus, it was not subject to the administrative requirements of the Commonwealth Documents Law, 45 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 1101-1602. Petitioner had not stated a claim under 28 Pa. Code &sect; 115.29. He had not alleged that he was denied access to his records, that he requested copies of his medical records and was charged unreasonable fees, or that he was a patient and that the Department operated a health care facility within the meaning of the Health Care Facilities Act, 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 448.101 - 448.904b. Finally, the bare allegations that the fees were inflated and unjustified, without a context in which the fees had been applied, failed to state a claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner hospital system sought administrative review of respondent Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare's (DPW) finding that its psychiatric care was below accepted medical standards. The Bureau of Hearings and Appeals (Pennsylvania) (BHA) adopted an administrative law judge's (ALJ) decision that this standard of care was daily examination by a psychiatrist, and denied the hospital's appeal. The hospital sought judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital said 55 Pa. Code &sect; 1101.75(a)(7)'s falling &quot;below accepted medical treatment standard&quot; language was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court held the standard of meeting &quot;accepted medical treatment standards&quot; was general but gave sufficient notice to care providers that to receive Medicaid reimbursement, they had to ascertain the accepted standard in the medical community and comply with it. DPW's expert's testimony was legally sufficient to support a finding that failure to examine psychiatric patients on a daily basis was below accepted medical treatment standards because the hospital stipulated the witness was an expert, and the weight given his testimony was for the ALJ. The expert's ascertainment of the level of care in other institutions was relevant in finding the &quot;accepted medical treatment standard.&quot; He properly reviewed medical records from other hospitals, and his opinion was also based on his education and experience as a psychiatrist for numerous acute inpatient facilities. The ALJ's determination of the credibility of experts was not disturbed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant borough councilman appealed an order entered by the Common Pleas Court of the County of Chester (Pennsylvania), which granted a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by appellee borough in a declaratory judgment action filed by the councilman seeking a declaration that, to the extent that a pay ordinance eliminated the compensation of council members during their terms of office, it violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 27 (&sect; 27).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that Baldwin v. Philadelphia, which held that a municipal ordinance was not a law for purposes of &sect; 27, controlled. Under Baldwin, because a municipal ordinance was not a &quot;law&quot; within the meaning of former Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 13 (now &sect; 27), a mid-term salary increase could be effected by ordinance without violating that particular constitutional provision. The councilman's claim that the constitutional prohibition against mid-term changes in compensation for public officials that was imposed on the Pennsylvania general assembly by &sect; 27 had to apply with equal force to the borough was rejected. The cases cited by the councilman were distinguished, or did not address the application of &sect; 27 to municipal ordinances. The claim that &sect; 1001 of the Pennsylvania Borough Code, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46001 (&sect; 1001), had to be read to incorporate the restriction of &sect; 27 was rejected. Section 1001 only codified the 126-year-old precedent established in Baldwin. Finally, the councilman's claim, after a discussion of Blackstone, that contrary to the holding in Baldwin, a municipal ordinance also had to be considered to be a &quot;law&quot; was rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased claimant sustained a right ankle injury at work. The claimant's employer offered to settle the claim for $ 25,000. The employer required Medicare approval to effectuate the Compromise and Release Agreement. The claimant died before the Agreement was executed. On appeal, the widow argued that the employer's insistence on getting Medicare approval stalled the process and imposed a condition that was not required by the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act. The court concluded that the failure to satisfy the statutory requirements of &sect; 449 of the Act, 77 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;1000.5, precluded approval of the Agreement. The death of the claimant before the requirements of signature, notary and hearing was not recognized in the Act as providing any exception. Contrary to the widow's claim, Medicare's approval of the Agreement was a legitimate condition upon which the parties failed to agree. Because the Agreement was never finalized, there was no Agreement for the WCJ to approve. Finally, the court concluded that there was no due process violation, as the compromise and release of workers' compensation claims was not a constitutionally protected interest.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County (Pennsylvania) denied the association's claim for a retrospective refund of taxes paid on land owned by the association. The association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association sought a refund of real estate tax paid for the tax years 2001 to 2003. The trial court held that a refund could not be issued in any tax year for which the association had not challenged its assessment. The court stated that a taxpayer could not claim a refund under the Tax Refund Law, 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5566b, when the taxpayer had a remedy available under any other statute. Here, 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5453.704 provided the association with a statutory remedy to contest the assessments for which it now sought a refund. Accordingly, the association was not entitled to a retrospective tax refund under the Tax Refund Law for 2001 to 2003. Next, the Pennsylvania Uniform Planned Community Act, 68 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 5101-5414, did not place the burden on the taxing authorities to investigate, on their own initiative, the status of each parcel in a planned community as either a unit or a common facility. It was a taxpayer's burden to prove its right to a tax exemption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, a city and its mayor, sued appellant Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), challenging its decision to eliminate paper transfers. The Philadelphia County Common Pleas Court (Pennsylvania) vacated SEPTA's decision, finding it was arbitrary and capricious. SEPTA appealed; appellees moved to dismiss the appeal as moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that SEPTA decided to eliminate paper transfers without any study of the impact on those who would be most adversely affected. In view of the real potential for harm to those who most heavily relied upon SEPTA, the trial court concluded that SEPTA's decision was &quot;capricious&quot; and was a manifest and flagrant abuse of its discretion. While the instant appeal was pending, SEPTA approved a new resolution that superseded the challenged plan and restored paper transfers. The resolution also indicated that SEPTA might revisit the paper transfer issue if, on appeal, its decision to eliminate them was affirmed. The instant court held that SEPTA's approval of the resolution rendered its appeal moot. The appeal did not involve whether, in the abstract, SEPTA could eliminate paper transfers, but whether the trial court erred in concluding that SEPTA abused its discretion in eliminating transfers under the facts of this particular case. If SEPTA again voted to eliminate transfers and appellees again challenged the action, the challenge would arise under a different set of facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The volunteer firefighter sustained a disabling injury while working for the employer. That entitled the volunteer firefighter to collect disability compensation of a certain weekly amount, using the formula for volunteer firefighters injured in the line of duty, 77 Pa. Stat.

The volunteer firefighter asserted that his weekly earnings from his work as a truck driver that he was unable to earn while on total disability should have been added to his presumed statutory wage. Under his proposed methodology, he was compensated in excess of the presumed statutory wage for volunteer firefighters. A workers' compensation judge denied the claim petition upon finding that presumed wages and actual wages could not be stacked. The Workers' Compensation Appeal Board affirmed. The appellate court found that the statute that allowed wages from different employers to be added, 77 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 582, could not be applied in the case of volunteer firefighting since that work was not performed under a &quot;concurrent contract&quot; of employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because defendant's convictions were based upon a void ordinance, the court agreed that its continued enforcement would have violated defendant's due process rights. The court found that the applicable statutory provisions restricted the collection of municipal obligations to those directly associated with the particular property for which the taxes or claims were owed. City of Sharon, Penn., Codified Ordinances &sect; 829.09 imposed a disability on a delinquent property owner, not on delinquent property. The ordinance was a tax collection device not authorized by the Third Class City Code. The city lacked the express, implied and necessary power to enact the provisions in the ordinance to withhold licenses and permits as a means of collecting real estate taxes and municipal debt. As a result, the provisions in the ordinance authorizing the imposition of civil fines and imprisonment were void. Because the judgment of sentence was based upon those void provisions in the ordinance, it had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commercial licensee challenged a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Luzerne (Pennsylvania), which dismissed his statutory appeal of a one-year disqualification of his commercial vehicle operating privileges pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1611(a)(1) of the Vehicle Code by appellee, a state department of transportation (department).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was convicted for driving under the influence of alcohol while operating an automobile (DUI). The licensee asserted that the department did not have the authority to disqualify him from operating a commercial vehicle because an Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) was not a conviction under 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1603. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 1603 expressly authorized the department to disqualify the licensee based upon his acceptance into ARD. Licensee's attempt to rely on 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6501(c), which did not include ARD in the definition of &quot;conviction,&quot; violated 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1602(b), which directed that 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1603 prevailed in a conflict. The suspension of his license was civil in nature and was separate from his criminal DUI proceeding. Thus, the legislature did not impermissibly infringe on the court's authority to define &quot;conviction.&quot; The greater harm that could be caused by commercial vehicles justified the imposition of harsher sanctions on commercial drivers than non-commercial drivers. Thus, there was no equal protection violation under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Penn. Const. art. I, &sect; 26, or Penn. Const. art. III, &sect; 32.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer filed a class action suit against appellee county board of assessment appeals, seeking refunds for overpayment of property taxes under an allegedly unconstitutional dual assessment scheme. The Fayette County Common Pleas Court (Pennsylvania) denied the taxpayer's petition for rule to show cause and dismissed her appeal. The taxpayer sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sought retroactive relief for past overpayments based on alleged over-assessments under the county's dual assessment scheme. The board lowered her current assessment, but denied her claim for retroactive relief. The trial held the board could not make changes to the valuation of property for the years preceding the current assessment, and that, if no appeal was taken from an assessment of taxes within the time allowed by law, the assessment became binding and conclusive. The appellate court agreed. While 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5020-511, 5453.703c, 5566b, and 5566c provided for tax refunds, they did not authorize retroactive assessment appeals. Therefore, because the taxpayer failed to challenge any assessments before the board during the time prescribed by law, neither the trial court nor the appellate court had subject matter jurisdiction over her appeal and thus could not provide relief. Finally, requests for tax refunds could not be pursued by class action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Act 143 amended 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2710, relating to the offense of ethnic intimidation, to include acts of malicious intention toward a person's actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity, when such conduct occurred in the course of the commission of certain other offenses. Petitioners filed this action after they were arrested and charged under Act 143 for evangelizing against individuals who were participating in a gay rights event. Although the charges were dismissed, petitioners asserted that they intended to engage in the same type of activity in the future. They argued that Act 143 violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, which provided that no bill could be altered or amended, on its passage through either House, as to change its original purpose. The court held that the original purpose of the bill which ultimately became Act 143, viewed in reasonably broad terms, was to criminalize crop destruction. As ultimately enacted, Act 143 expanded the classification of persons protected under the offense of ethnic intimidation. Based on the text of the initial bill, the amendments did not retain the original purpose of the bill.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient sued appellee department, and others, alleging various causes of action including, inter alia, intentional torts resulting from the submission of an &quot;Act 77 Historical&quot; data form (Act 77 form) to the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) relating to the patient's involuntary commitment to a mental health facility. The Common Pleas Court of the County of Allegheny (Pennsylvania) dismissed the action. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient alleged that false information was submitted to the PSP by the Act 77 form. The appellate court found that, despite the patient's allegations otherwise, the employee submitting the form possessed the required physician's certification under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6105(c)(4). Since the employee attached the physician's certification to the Act 77 form, the patient's claim failed. The trial court's reference to the patient's prior lawsuit did not provide the basis for its ruling on preliminary objections. As such, no basis for reversal was apparent. There was no authority for an award of monetary damages for the patient's claimed violations of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The legality of the patient's commitment was not at issue, and the patient failed to allege that a judicial order nullifying her commitment existed. Without a judicial order, the PSP was without authority to expunge a mental health record. Also, the PSP was an indispensable party as to this particular claim for injunctive relief. The patient failed to demonstrate how the timing of the immunity defense affected the ultimate conclusion of immunity. Absent a showing of prejudice, there was no reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A week after 2005 Pa. Laws 170, No. 44 (Act 44), setting the salaries for full-time district attorneys as well as judges, was enacted, the County Code was amended through 2005 Pa. Laws 266, No. 57 (Act 57). Act 44 was later repealed, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the repeal was unconstitutional as to judges' salaries. The court first held that it had jurisdiction over the district attorneys. They had a direct interest in their compensation and thus had to be made parties under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7540(a). Next, Act 44 and Act 57 provided irreconcilably different formulas for calculating compensation for full-time district attorneys. Because Act 57 had been enacted last, under 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1935, it controlled. Furthermore, the subsequent repeal of Act 44 was of no moment. As of July 14, 2005, the date Act 57 was executed, 16 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1401, part of Act 57, governed compensation for district attorneys. Because Act 44's formula for determining compensation never applied after Act 57 became effective, district attorneys' salaries were not affected by the repeal of Act 44, and petitioners' assertion that the repeal might violate Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 27 failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sued respondent Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (DOC), alleging its regulation violated state and federal laws and impermissibly restricted his constitutional rights. DOC filed preliminary objections, alleging the inmate (1) violated Pa.R.C.P. No. 1019(i) by not attaching the writings on which the claim was based to the petition; (2) failed to state a claim for relief; and (3) failed to exhaust administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged he filed a request under Pennsylvania's Right-to-Know Law (RTKL), 65 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 66.2-.9, with the Pennsylvania Department of State for blank Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) forms, and that DOC confiscated his UCC forms as contraband under DC-ADM 803-3. He filed a grievance; a grievance officer held his grievance failed to state a valid legal reason to possess the UCC forms. This petition followed. The court excused the inmate's failure to attach a copy of DC-ADM 803-3 to his brief, as required by Pa. R. Civ. P. 1019(i), due to his pro se status, his submission of the writing with his brief, and because DOC possessed the writing. The court held that as DC-ADM 803-3 had already been found constitutional, and as UCC forms were not &quot;public records&quot; under 65 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66.1 of the RTKL, the inmate had not shown a clear right to relief; therefore, his mandamus claim failed. And as his petition failed to allege that he appealed the grievance officer's decision to DOC or even that he appealed any DOC order to the instant court, he failed to exhaust all administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DOC's preliminary objections were overruled to the extent that they addressed the inmate's failure to conform to Pa.R.C.P No. 1019(i). The preliminary objections were sustained to the extent that they addressed the inmate's failure to state a claim on which mandamus relief could be granted and his failure to exhaust all administrative remedies. The inmate's petition was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant township challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County (Pennsylvania), which affirmed an adjudication of the Secretary of Labor and Industry to invalidate a township ordinance because it conflicted with the Department of Labor and Industry's regulation establishing uniform construction standards in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Appellee objectors has filed the challenge to the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The objectors were various builders associations and related entities. The ordinance required the installation of automatic sprinkler systems in most new construction in the township. The objectors had successfully argued that the ordinance did not satisfy the legal standard enumerated in the Pennsylvania Construction Code Act, 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 7210.101 - 7210.1103, for exceeding the minimum requirements of the Uniform Construction Code. The court noted that the case presented an issue of first impression, namely what constituted local circumstances or conditions that allowed a municipality to impose stricter standards on construction than those required by the Pennsylvania General Assembly, pursuant to the Act, for statewide use. The court did not doubt that sprinkler systems were an effective tool in fire suppression and that they saved lives. However, the court held that the township failed to proffer clear and convincing local conditions to justify a deviation from the minimum requirements of the Uniform Construction Code, which did not require automatic sprinklers in residential buildings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order upholding the adjudication of the Department that the ordinance was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hoteliers sued appellees, a county, city, and convention center authority, alleging the Pennsylvania Third Class County Convention Center Authority Act, 16 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2399.51-- 2399.73, and a county ordinance enacted thereunder violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. and Pennsylvania Constitutions. The Erie County Common Pleas Court (Pennsylvania) upheld the Act and ordinance. The hoteliers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Act, the county created the convention center authority and enacted an ordinance imposing a room tax to be used, in part, to build a convention center. The authority used some of the tax revenues for planning and developing a hotel to be connected to the convention center. The trial court rejected the hoteliers' contention that the use of these tax revenues to develop that hotel imposed a disproportionate competitive burden on existing hotels. The trial court found from the evidence that the general increase in tourism resulting from the promotional marketing conducted with some of the room tax revenues would result in additional business for area hoteliers, such that, on balance, there was no palpably disproportionate burden on them to justify invalidating the tax. The appellate court held that these findings were amply supported by the record. It noted that the U.S. Supreme Court had rejected the proposition that tax-subsidized competition from a public entity that intruded on the profits of private enterprise was per se improper. The hoteliers' general objection to a publicly funded competitor did not justify the relief they sought.</SPAN></P>

Respondents filed preliminary objections to the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court had previously held that the legislature's repeal by Act 72 of Act 44 was unconstitutional insofar as it reduced judicial compensation; enjoined the repeal of Act 44 in part; and ordered that judicial compensation be calculated under Act 44. Petitioner filed the instant suit, arguing that as the supreme court did not address the issue of whether the judges would be entitled to COLAs under Act 44 or former 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1810, respondents had no authority to grant COLAs to judges. The trial court initially held that it had subject matter jurisdiction over this suit under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 761, because it was a civil action filed against state officers. But as the supreme court, not the Chief Justice, had authority over the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts, the Chief Justice was not a proper party to the action. As to the merits of petitioner's claim, Pennsylvania judges were clearly entitled to COLAs under 65 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 366.2a(i); therefore, the fact that the supreme court had not reinstated 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1810 was immaterial. Thus, the complaint did not state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sustained the preliminary objection which contended that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and dismissed with the complaint with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed an amended petition for review seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, to which respondents, government officials and others, filed preliminary objections. The matter involved the transfer of a 10-acre complex--a dedicated public park, which was purchased in 1977 with &quot;Project 70&quot; funds and carried restrictions as to its use--from a city redevelopment authority to a city university.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amended petition raised constitutional challenges to the passage of the act that transferred the complex. The court concluded that the pleaded facts were insufficient to state a claim against the governor because petitioner cited to no legal authority for the proposition that a governor had a duty to make inquires before signing legislation. In addition, the House of Representatives and its members were immune from suit under the Speech and Debate Clause, Pa. Const. art. 2, &sect; 15, because all these parties did was participate in the legislative process. This same reasoning applied to the Senate parties. 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3946.20(b) provided limitations on the alienation of property acquired under the Project 70 Land Acquisition and Borrowing Act, 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 3946.1-3946.22, by directing that owners of such property could not dispose of the land without the approval of the General Assembly. Because the General Assembly acted under its constitutional authority in adopting the Project 70 Act, and acted pursuant to its authority under the Act in approving the transfer of the property, the amended petition failed to state a claim against the Senate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The preliminary objections of the governor, the House of Representatives, the Speaker of the House, the Majority Leader of the House, the Senate, the Minority Leader of the Senate, and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, were sustained. The remaining claims were transferred to the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County (Pennsylvania).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorneys filed an amended petition for review, alleging that the adoption of 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 774 violated Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 10 by allowing non-employee, non-attorneys to represent corporate employers in unemployment proceedings. The attorneys also filed a motion for summary judgment. Respondent, the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry, Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, filed a motion for summary relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court concluded that the adoption of 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 774 did not violate Pa. Const. art.

Thus, the attorneys were clearly not entitled to summary judgment on their claim. With respect to the Board's motion for summary relief, the appellate court agreed that, while the state supreme court's plurality decision in Harkness II was not precedential, its reasoning was still highly persuasive. In reversing the appellate court's decision in Harkness I that a non-employee, non-attorney could not represent an employer at an unemployment compensation hearing, the state supreme court had removed the underlying support for the attorneys' claim that 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 774 was unconstitutional. Thus, the Board was entitled to judgment on the attorneys' claim as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Insurers filed a petition for review requesting a declaration that a notice published by the Insurance Department explaining the Department's interpretation of statutes relating to insurance coverage for drug and alcohol dependency treatment and regulation of managed health care was inconsistent with the statutes. The parties moved for judgment on the pleadings. Following a remand, the court considered the merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statutes were known as Act 106, 40 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 908-1 to 908-8, and Act 68, 40 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 991.2101 to 991.2194. The Department's notice stated that under Act 106, the only lawful prerequisite before an insured obtains nonhospital residential and outpatient coverage for alcohol and drug dependency treatment was a certification and referral from a licensed physician or licensed psychologist. The Department determined that Act 68 did not change the requirements under Act 106 and should be read in conjunction with the existing requirements. The insurers argued that no language in Act 106 stripped managed care plans of their ability to perform medical necessity and utilization review with respect to these benefits. The court held that the Department's view of the issue was the most logical and rational one, more in keeping with the intent of the legislature and the rules of statutory construction. The court held that Act 106 plainly provided for mandatory benefits and that nothing solely on its face, apart from certification and referral, limited the availability of mandatory benefits by any extraneous procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the Insurance Department was granted, and the petition for review in this matter was dismissed with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner resident taxpayer challenged an amendment to County Code, art. XIV, 16 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 1401-1441, known as Act 57 of 2005, Act 57 of 2005, 2005 Pa. Laws 312, which allowed sitting district attorneys to convert from part-time to full-time status, with an accompanying increase in compensation. Respondents, the general assembly and the presiding officer of each house, filed preliminary objections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer alleged that Act 57 violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 27. Respondents sought dismissal of the suit on either of two bases: legislative immunity pursuant to Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 15 or the taxpayer's lack of standing because the amendment did not impact the district attorney in the county where the taxpayer lived. In sustaining the preliminary objections, the court found that the taxpayer lacked standing. The taxpayer did not contend that Act 57 caused any discernible adverse effect to any of his interests other than the abstract interest of all citizens in having others comply with the law. Thus, it was clear that the taxpayer did not enjoy standing under the traditional test. The taxpayer lacked taxpayer standing because he was not the best situated to assert a challenge to Act 57. County commissioners, controllers, auditors or treasurers in any of the 31 counties in which the status of the district attorney changed after Act 57 would be the best suited to challenge the statute because county finances under their control would be detrimentally affected by the county's share of increased compensation to be paid to another county officer, the district attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the preliminary objection to standing and dismissed the suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Harrisburg City Council sought review of the orders of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Dauphin (Pennsylvania), which granted appellee mayor a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of Harrisburg, Pa., Ordinance&nbsp;36-2006 (January 23, 2007) (the Ordinance) and prohibited the Council's appointees to the Harrisburg Authority Board from acting as members of the Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Council appointed Board members, pursuant to an Ordinance passed over the mayor's veto. The court dissolved the preliminary injunction prohibiting the Council from enforcing its Ordinance and its appointees from acting as Board members. The court held that the trial court arguably had reasonable grounds, pursuant to 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41608(b) of the Third Class City Charter Law, to enjoin the Council from seating appointees before the Ordinance's March 12, 2007, effective date; however, the trial court had no apparently reasonable grounds to enjoin the City from enforcing its Ordinance. The court held that the mayor failed to satisfy the essential prerequisites to an injunction because there was no actual proof of irreparable harm from the appointments to the operations of the Board, the fiscal issues, the Board's bonds or bondholders, or the completion of an incinerator project. The court held that the trial court recognized that it was not clear whether the Ordinance violated any enabling statutes or whether the mayor had a right to relief and did not discuss the Municipality Authorities Act, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5601-5623, or statutes defining the term &quot;governing body.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the orders and dissolved the preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An unincorporated association and others filed actions against local taxing districts and others challenging the use of tax increment financing for a commercial development project.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxing districts approved the use of tax increment financing for a proposes 333-acre commercial development. On appeal, the association first argued that the trial court erred in holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The appellate court held that an appeal would not lie under the Local Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 551-555, 751-754, from the enactment of a resolution by a local taxing entity authorizing the use of tax increment financing for a commercial development. The appellate court found that the association's conclusory allegations in their claims for equitable relief were nothing more than an attack on the wisdom of the legislative enactments. The appellate court further held that the trial court properly sustained the districts' demurrer to a claim that the districts acted in bad faith in determining that the area of the development was blighted. The association's argument that because township supervisors voted to rezone the property to a commercial designation, the districts could not in good faith have believed the property to be blighted was a bald assertion, unsupported by any clear averments of fact to support a finding of fraud or bad faith.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, two restaurants, sought review of a decision of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Allegheny (Pennsylvania), which found that the Commonwealth's Clean Indoor Air Act, which regulated indoor smoking in public places, was not ultra vires. It also denied permanent injunctive relief, although it granted an injunction to prevent enforcement of the ordinance. At issue were &sect;&sect; 10.1 and 15.1 of the Act of April 27, 1927, Pub. L. No. 465.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act broadly applied to municipalities, and &sect; 15.1 of the Act specified that the Act preempted and superseded any local ordinance or rule concerning the subject matter of &sect; 10.1 of the Act, 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1235.1(a). Section 10.1 regulated smoking in restaurants. The county, however, adopted an ordinance that prohibited all smoking in public places. Preliminarily, the state commonwealth court found that &sect; 15.1 of the Act had not been repealed. Although the Pennsylvania Construction Code Act of November 10, 1999, Pub. L. No. 491, as amended, 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 7210.101-7210.1103, included a provision that, when effective, would repeal &sect; 15.1, the repealing regulations were not published for a number of years, and, in the interim the repealer was repealed. Because the repealer never went into effect, the status quo continued, and &sect; 15.1 of the Act was not affected. Accordingly, the county was without authority to enact the ordinance based upon the express preemption language contained in &sect; 15.1. Moreover, as the trial court erred in concluding that the ordinance was not ultra vires, it erred by not enjoining the county from seeking to enforce it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order denying declaratory judgment in favor of the restaurants was reversed, as was its order denying their request for permanent injunctive relief. The case was remanded to the trial court with the direction that it enter a permanent injunction against the county with regard to the enforcement of its anti-smoking ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission held that the employee, a veteran, was not entitled to have 10 points added to his civil service examination test results because he had already used a veterans' preference at the time he was first hired by the Commonwealth.

The court held that the Commission's decision finding that a veterans' preference may be used once, and once only, in the course of one's employment in the classified service of the Commonwealth was invalid. The court held that Management Directive 580.21(2)(d) was not consistent with the plain language of 51 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7103(a), which mandated that a veteran received 10 additional points on every civil service examination whenever such an examination was successfully passed for a civil service appointment or promotional examination for a public position with the Commonwealth. As such, the court held that Management Directive 580.21(2)(d) was unenforceable to the extent it sought to limit the use of the preference to a one-time use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry ruled that petitioner contractor intentionally violated the Pennsylvania Prevailing Wage Act, 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 165-1 to 165-17, by failing to pay prevailing wages on certain public works projects and debarred it from contracting for any further projects for three years. Respondent Pennsylvania Prevailing Wage Appeals Board affirmed. The contractor sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary found that the contractor used a set 6:2 ratio for prevailing wage projects (i.e., it paid skilled laborers such as electricians at laborers' rate for two hours of each day, regardless of the work performed), even after being advised that this was improper; and that it advised its employees to juggle their timecards to end up with this ratio. The appellate court held that this was substantial evidence in support of the Secretary's conclusion that the contractor intentionally violated &sect; 5 (43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 165-5) of the Act. The Secretary was within its rights to rescind a hearing officer's decisional authority, and as the contractor had a full and fair opportunity to present its case, such rescission did not violate its rights to due process and a fair hearing. The Department's Bureau of Labor Law Compliance did not shift the burden of proof to the contractor. The contractor's &quot;void for vagueness&quot; claim failed; although neither the Act nor its regulations specifically defined laborers' tasks on any given prevailing wage project, the regulations appropriately relied on the custom and usage in the building and construction industry to give meaning to the term.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 165-1 to 165-17, by failing to pay the prevailing wages due their workers on certain public works projects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An investigation of the employer by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry's Bureau of Labor Law Compliance revealed that the employer had utilized set ratios for prevailing wage projects, regardless of the work being performed. Several workers testified that they were required to record certain of their hours at the lower laborer's rate, rather than the higher insulator's rate, even if they worked their entire shift as an insulator. The Secretary debarred and prohibited appellants from the award of any public works contract for a period of three years and awarded penalties and statutory damages. The court held that the testimony constituted substantial evidence in support of the Secretary's conclusion that appellants had intentionally violated the Act. The court also held that the Act was not unconstitutionally vague regarding the appropriate classification of laborers' work because appellants' violation of the Act was premised upon their utilization of set ratios for prevailing wage projects, regardless of the work being performed, not as the result of the Act's silence with respect to a specific definition of laborers' tasks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the state attorney general and the state police, filed preliminary objections seeking dismissal of the petition for review filed by petitioner inmate because it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The inmate sought expungement of his DNA and fingerprint records retained pursuant to 2002 Pa. Laws 394 (Act 57) because the act was declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the constitutional violation that occurred in the enactment of Act 57 required the destruction of the inmate's DNA and fingerprint samples. The court found that the challenge to Act 57 was not to the substance of the law but to the procedure by which it was enacted. As such, the court did not invalidate Act 57 because the state's DNA testing of its prison population was categorically or per se unconstitutional nor did it hold that actions under Act 57 were nullified. Therefore, the inmate's DNA and fingerprint samples were not invalidated merely because Act 57 was held invalid. Because it was declared unconstitutional, Act 57 never had any effect on the law that it sought to repeal, namely, the DNA Detection of Sexual and Violent Offenders Act (DNA Act), 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 7651.101-7651.1102. The DNA Act was in effect when the inmate provided the DNA and fingerprint samples. The DNA Act authorized a statewide process for DNA identification of persons convicted of felony sex offenses and certain enumerated violent crimes, and it provided authority for the inmate's testing. Destruction of the inmate's DNA and fingerprint samples was not required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The preliminary objections filed by respondents were sustained, and the petition for review was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant law firm challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which denied its petition for money damages and counsel fees in connection with a successful mandamus action against the defendants, a prothonotary and a motions clerk, of the trial court. The firm claimed that 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8303, entitled it to damages as a successful plaintiff in mandamus and 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2503 entitled it to counsel fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firm filed a complaint in mandamus with the trial court alleging that the prothonotary and clerk engaged in a discriminatory practice by permitting attorneys outside of the county to file preliminary objections through the mail, yet mandating that attorneys within the county personally file preliminary objections with the prothonotary and clerk. The prothonotary and clerk' refusal, according to the firm, forced it to send one of its employees to personally file documents, costing both time and money. The firm asserted that these damages were incident to the prothonotary and clerk' failure to accept filings by mail. Moreover, the firm argued that damages were recoverable even when not claimed in the pleadings. However, because the firm failed to request damages in its amended complaint in mandamus, pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1095, it was precluded from recovering damages. Also, there was no evidence to demonstrate that the prothonotary and clerk acted in bad faith. 42 Pa. C.S. &sect; 2503(9) did not authorize an award of counsel fees to a pro se litigant. Because it represented itself in this litigation, the firm, acted pro se, precluding an award of counsel fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision to deny mandamus damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner owned two vacant lots in Philadelphia which were in an area zoned R-10 Residential District. The property owner filed two separate applications with the Department of Licenses and Inspections to construct a single family dwelling on each respective lot. The Department denied each application. The property owner appealed to the zoning board of adjustment and sought a dimensional variance as to each lot. The board concluded the property owner presented sufficient evidence for a variance. The taxpayer appealed. The trial court concluded that Philadelphia, Pa., Zoning Code &sect; 14-1807(1) was subordinate to the General Assembly's enactment of &sect; 17.1 of the First Class City Home Rule Act, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13131.1. The appellate court held that as the taxpayer failed to present evidence establishing himself as an aggrieved party, he did not have standing to prosecute the appeals. Contrary to the taxpayer's argument, the bill at issue did not involve two, unrelated subjects. Thus, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13131.1 was not violative of the single-subject rule under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

Intervenor, the City of Philadelphia, also appealed, and one defendant cross-appealed the sustainment of plaintiff's preliminary objections to a counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's suit sought a declaration from the trial court that defendants, who were possible mayoral candidates, were required to abide by campaign contribution dollar limits set forth in the city ordinance. Plaintiff asserted that defendants received illegal contributions in violation of the ordinance. The trial court granted defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, concluding that the ordinance was unconstitutional, void, and unenforceable. The court determined that the trial court erred in granting defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings based on the Pennsylvania Constitution, the Home Rule Act, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13131 and 13133, and the City's Home Rule Charter, which granted the City complete powers of legislation and administration with regard to its municipal functions, except as to when the legislature had expressly or impliedly indicated its intent to assume exclusive jurisdiction over a field. Because the Pennsylvania legislature had indicated no intent to assume exclusive jurisdiction over the field of campaign finance in connection with setting contribution limits for local elective office, the ordinance was constitutional and enforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county and its board of property assessment review appealed from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which struck down a rule adopted by the board with respect to assessment appeals. The board's rule limited the scope of appellee taxpayers' appeal to the question of whether the base year market value assigned to the taxpayers' property in the last county-wide assessment was correct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rule at issue prohibited taxpayers from challenging their assessment for the simple reason that it exceeded the property's current market value. The court agreed that the board lacked the statutory authority to limit assessment appeals in that way. 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5452.10 gave the taxpayer the ability to challenge its assessment for the reason that the base year market value no longer reflected the property's current market value. It was the taxpayer's decision which theory to pursue in its assessment appeal, i.e., that the assessment exceeded the current market value or the assessment was based upon an incorrect base year market value. Once that valuation was determined in accordance with the appeal it was to stand as the valuation for the assessment of all county taxes. The trial court did not err in declaring the rule's limitation on assessment appeals to be invalid, as the rule impermissibly circumscribed the taxpayers' appeal rights that were guaranteed in 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5452.10.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, members of the Republican and Democratic parties, filed objections to the nomination petition of respondent judicial candidate based on the candidate's failure to file a statement of financial interests with the Pennsylvania Ethics Commission as required by the Ethics Act, 65 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1104(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate, who already held another judicial office, attached a statement of financial interests to his nomination petitions but did not make a separate filing with the Commission. He testified that he had received both written and oral advice from Commission that as an incumbent judicial officer, he was not required to file the statement with the Commission. The advice was apparently based on the Kremer decision, which concluded that sitting jurists were not subject to the Ethics Act because application of the Act would infringe on the supreme court's general supervisory and administrative authority over the courts. The court found that in relying on both the written and oral advice of the Commission, the candidate had &quot;substantially complied&quot; with &sect; 1104(b). The court also ruled that requiring all candidates to file the financial statements with the Commission and to append copies thereof to their nominating petitions did not violate the separation of powers and was not prohibited by Kremer. Because the candidate substantially complied, and because the constitutional issue involved was one of first impression, the court applied its decision prospectively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County (Pennsylvania) which affirmed the decision of an appointed Hearing Officer in favor of appellee Board of Supervisors and determined that certain provisions of Union Township, Pa., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 905.3 were unconstitutional and invalidated and severed them but otherwise upheld the Ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner owned property in an AP-Agricultural Preservation District. The Hearing Officer rejected claims of exclusion. The Hearing Officer concluded that the legislative judgment did not violate substantive due process and that Union Township, Pa., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 401.1 passed muster, based on balancing the rights of the property owner to be free of undue restrictions on its use of property against the public policy of the state, county and Township to encourage active farming on large contiguous tracts. The Hearing Officer decided that any inconsistency was not fatal. The Hearing Officer granted the validity challenge to the extent of invalidating Union Township, Pa., Zoning Ordinance, &sect; 905.3(E), (F) and (I) and severing them, but he denied all remaining requests. The appellate court agreed that the property owner's assertions regarding intent were unavailing. The stated purpose of the Ordinance was to preserve prime agricultural soils, and the Ordinance accomplished that purpose. The Ordinance was a valid exercise of police power as it is substantially related to the purpose that it purported to serve.</SPAN></P>

The Franklin County Common Pleas Court (Pennsylvania) sustained the county's preliminary objections on the ground it was immune from suit under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8541. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged county employees interfered with his rights in his trial, appeals, post-conviction relief petitions, and civil suits, resulting in his illegal incarceration. As he could not identify the responsible employees, he invoked respondeat superior. The appellate court held that his civil conspiracy, IIED, and libel claims failed because the county was not liable under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8550 for its employees' intentional torts. His claim that the county negligently failed to transmit records and docket pleadings failed as these acts did not fall within 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8542(b)'s exceptions to immunity. While his allegations could have supported a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action asserting a violation of his right of access to the courts, the claim failed because he could not identify the employees who allegedly committed the wrongful acts. Whether viewed as a state tort claim or as a federal civil rights claim, his civil conspiracy claim failed; as he could not recover for the underlying torts of IIED and libel, there could be no conspiracy as to them. His request to amend his complaint under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1033 was properly denied, as an amendment would not have cured its defects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of an order from the Common Pleas Court of the County of Montgomery (Pennsylvania), which dismissed his complaint against appellees, a county and various county taxing authorities and officials, with prejudice. The owner had filed an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, seeking relief based on the alleged improper assessment of real estate taxes. Appellees' motion for sanctions was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner entered into a trust agreement, wherein the property he resided on became the sole corpus thereof. There was no particular purpose declared for the trust. Believing that the property was free from taxation under the Contract Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, the owner filed his action in both his individual and joint trustee capacity. A prior identical action was dismissed for failure to have followed the statutory procedures of the General County Assessment Law, 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5020-1 - 5020-602. A similar action in federal court was also dismissed. Thereafter, the owner's request for real estate tax exemption was denied by the county board of assessment appeals. Rather than seeking judicial review, the owner filed the instant action, which was dismissed with prejudice. The trial court denied appellees' sanction motion. On appeal, the court found that the state statutory procedures provided the owner with an adequate remedy, and he could assert his claims of statutory unconstitutionality on judicial review of any determination made. As he had relentlessly pursued a meritless claim using the wrong procedure, sanctions were deemed appropriate under Pa.R.A.P. 2744.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court and imposed a sanction of reasonable attorney fees to appellees. The matter was remanded to the trial court to determine the appropriate amount of fees to be awarded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought a real estate tax exemption under &sect; 204(a)(3) (72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5020-204(a)(3)) of the Pennsylvania General County Assessment Law. Appellee board of assessment appeals denied the request. The taxpayer appealed; the Jefferson County Common Pleas Court (Pennsylvania) affirmed. The taxpayer sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer provided low-income housing for the elderly and received subsidies under the federal Section 202 Program. It claimed it met the requirements of &sect; 204(a)(3) of the Assessment Law and was thus automatically deemed to be a &quot;purely public charity&quot; that did not have to satisfy the Hospital Utilization Project's (HUP's) five-prong test for exemption under the Pennsylvania Institutions of Purely Public Charity Act, 10 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 371- 385. The appellate court disagreed; an entity seeking a statutory tax exemption had to establish it was a &quot;purely public charity&quot; under Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2 before a court could reach the question of whether it was entitled to a statutory exemption. The taxpayer waived its claims as to its compliance with the Charity Act because it did not present them to the trial court. It did not meet the second prong of the HUP test as it did not show it donated a &quot;substantial portion&quot; of its services; its residents paid rent that was then subsidized by the U.S. government. As to the fourth prong, it did not show it was abating government costs, as its rents were not below the market rate; it was merely a Section 202 Program housing provider.</SPAN></P>

The city petitioned to vacate the award, claiming the panel violated the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority Act for Cities of the First Class (PICA). The Philadelphia County Common Pleas Court (Pennsylvania) denied relief; the city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arbitration award increased the city's contribution for current and retired police officers' health care coverage. The city claimed the panel violated PICA by failing to accord substantial weight to the city's five-year financial plan and its ability to pay the increased award without adversely affecting city services, and by finding the city had the ability to pay the increased award. Applying an extreme standard of deference to Act 111 arbitration awards, the trial court declined to review the arbitrators' findings of law and fact and denied the city's petition. The union contended that courts could not review Act 111 awards for legal or factual error. The appellate court disagreed. The clear language of &sect; 209(k) (53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12720.209(k)) of PICA required the trial court to review an arbitration award entered pursuant to Act 11 to determine whether the arbitrators accorded substantial weight to the city's five-year financial plan and its ability to pay increased award without adversely affecting city services. Because the trial court applied a narrow certiorari scope of review, it did not reach the merits of the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated the order of the trial court and remanded for consideration on the merits so that the trial court could apply the proper standard of review articulated under PICA in accordance with the appellate court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board determined that the company failed to meet the threshold requirements to establish entitlement to a variance to allow the company to build an advertising sign that was higher and larger than allowed by the borough's zoning ordinance. The appellate court held that the fact that the board determined that the ordinance included a de jure exclusion concerning off-site billboards did not automatically permit the company to erect whatever kind of structure it wished without investigation into the reasonableness of the proposed plans. The appellate court held that the board's explanation as to why it utilized the existing provisions of the zoning ordinance in order to rectify the unconstitutional infirmity was supported by substantial evidence of record. Therefore, the Board's use of the same regulations for on-site and off-site advertising signs was appropriate under the circumstances. Furthermore, the appellate court held that because the record contained proof reflecting the existence of advertising signs that met the size restrictions set forth in the zoning ordinance, there was no de facto exclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (DOT), sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County (Pennsylvania), which sustained the statutory appeal of appellee licensee from the requirement that he comply with 2000 Pa. Laws 63 (Act 63), formerly 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 7001-7003 (repealed), relating to ignition interlock devices. The current interlock requirements were found at 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3801.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee had been convicted on a driving under the influence (DUI) charge on November 21, 2000; the licensee had two prior DUI convictions from 1997. Pursuant to former 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7002(2), as a condition precedent to the restoration of the licensee's operating privilege, he was required to install an ignition interlock system on his vehicles. The DOT provided the notice authorized by 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1542(d) that the licensee's operating privilege was revoked for five years as a habitual offender. The licensee was granted nunc pro nunc relief as to the interlock requirement due to the trial court's interpretation that the triggering DUI offense, which occurred on November 30, 1999, took place prior to September 30, 2000, the effective date of Act 63. However, the court reversed because the language of 2000 Pa. Laws 63, &sect; 3 clearly stated that the interlock requirement applied to all persons convicted of a second or subsequent violation of 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3731 on or after the Act's effective date. Because the licensee was convicted of his third DUI on November 21, 2000, the interlock requirement was properly applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Motor Vehicles (DOT), sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County (Pennsylvania), which granted the appeal of appellee licensee and ordered that DOT's cancellation of the licensee's operator's license be rescinded. The trial court concluded in its order that an earlier version of 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1572 applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was convicted in New Jersey of operating a motor vehicle while in possession of a controlled substance. His ability to obtain a New Jersey Driver's license was suspended. The DOT learned of the suspension and issued a notice of cancellation of the licensee's driver's license. The trial court ordered that the cancellation be rescinded. The appellate court held that the court was to look to the licensee's current operating privilege status and the current 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1572 of the Motor Vehicle Code in determining whether the licensee's license was properly cancelled by DOT based on an old conviction. A suspension based on that old conviction continued due to the licenssee's failure to pay a license restoration fee. Hence, the trial court erred in applying the older version of 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1572. Further, the cancellation was proper under &sect; 1572(a)(1)(i) because the licensee was not entitled to have his license renewed under 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1503(a)(1) as a result of the current suspension of his operating privileges in New Jersey. Given the prompt issuance of the notice of cancellation, there was no due process violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Pennsylvania State Police Municipal Police Officers' Education and Training Commission revoked petitioner applicant's certification as a municipal police officer on grounds he made a false statement on his certification application in violation of 34 Pa. Code &sect; 203.14(a)(7). The applicant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After evaluating the applicant, a psychologist found he was a psychological risk to be a police officer. He obtained a second evaluation from another psychologist, who found no impediment to his serving as an officer. The application asked if he had undergone any other psychological evaluation in the past year; he answered &quot;no.&quot; After a hearing, the Commission revoked his certification under 37 Pa. Code &sect; 203.14(a)(5) for filing a fraudulent application in violation of 34 Pa. Code &sect; 203.14(a)(7), and under 34 Pa. Code &sect; 203.14(a)(7) and (a)(8), because it had issued his certification in error. He claimed his due process rights were violated because the Commission amended its revocation notice to add two other charges after he exercised his right to a hearing. The court held that as the amendment was filed 30 days before the hearing, his due process rights were not violated because he had ample time to prepare his defense. The record supported the Commission's findings. That he allegedly submitted the false application due to pressure from his boss was not a defense. No precedent supported his theory that only agency heads who were attorneys could adjudicate administrative hearings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

Petitioners challenged the validity of regulation amendments to nursing facility payment rates and sought a declaration that the amended regulations were unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners asserted that the amendments to the regulations were authorized by 2005 Pa. Laws 177, which was allegedly unconstitutional on several grounds. Petitioners' amended petition for review sought to increase funding by invalidating the cost adjustment regulation amendments. Petitioners requested a declaration that the cost adjustment regulations were invalid and sought a permanent injunction requiring DPW to set rates for fiscal year 2005-06 using the pre-amendment regulations. The court found no constitutional infirmity with regard to the enacted regulation amendments, finding that the amendments maintained a single unifying subject and that neither the Pennsylvania legislators nor the public were actually deceived by the contents of the house bill regarding the amendments. As such, the court found that petitioners failed to plead a violation of the clear title rule set forth in Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. The court also determined that the original purpose of the house bill did not change by enactment of the amendments. The court also upheld the delegation of regulation changes to DPW as within the scope of the federal Medicaid Act and the Pennsylvania Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained DPW's preliminary objections and dismissed petitioners' amended petition. The court sustained DPW's demurrers to all eight counts of petitioners' amended petition for review as well as dismissed petitioners' motion for class certification as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the city and the union were unable to reach agreement on terms of a successor collective bargaining agreement relating to medical benefits, the union demanded interest arbitration. The arbitration award capped the city's contribution toward the cost of future police retirees' medical insurance at an amount equal to that paid by the city for such coverage on the date of an officer's retirement. The commonwealth court's decision that consensual modification of future retirees' benefits was constitutionally permissible was remanded for consideration of whether 53 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2962(c)(3), as interpreted by the supreme court, precluded the arbitration panel from reducing post-retirement medical benefits for officers who had not yet retired. The commonwealth court found no conflict between its prior decision and either &sect; 2962(c)(3) or the supreme court's decision in Appeal of Upper Providence Township. The supreme court's decision concerned the statute's prohibition against diminishment of rights of former employees, and &sect; 2962(c)(3) did not apply to changes to present employees' benefits that arose under contract rather than under a statutory pension or retirement system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the owner of an auto sales mart, challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which discharged his previously entered rule to show cause. As a result of a criminal investigation regarding inaccurate odometer readings and the sale of defective motor vehicles, the Commonwealth, acting through the Attorney General (AG), entered into an assurance of voluntary compliance (AVC) with the owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the AVC, the owner agreed to pay civil penalties; forfeit the right to do business in any capacity in the automotive industry in the Commonwealth; recognize the trial court's jurisdiction over the AVC; and comply with relevant statutes. The owner had petitioned for a rule to show cause why the AVC should not be modified to allow him to maintain his license, essentially to modify his signed AVC agreement, which had been filed in 1987. On appeal, the owner asserted that the rule to show cause was final and appealable because it carried the effect of putting the losing party out of court. The court agreed that the trial court's dissolution of the rule to show cause was final and appealable since the trial court's decision terminated the owner's action to modify the AVC and forced him to either appeal or file another action. However, the court upheld the discharge because the rule to show case was not the proper vehicle to amend the AVC. Upon filing the signed AVC, the matter between the owner and the AG was closed and had to be reopened by the AG under 73 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 201-5 for any change to be addressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The credit union filed a notice with the Department that it intended to convert its charter from an occupation-based credit union to a community credit union.

The credit union informed the Department that, as it failed to act within 30 days of receipt of the charter conversion notice, the notice was deemed approved under 17 Pa.C.S. &sect; 501(g); the Department agreed. The court held that the Department's failure to act by conducting a hearing prior to the deemed approval violated 10 Pa. Code &sect; 3.6's mandatory hearing rule, which applied to the credit union's application. Because the requirements of procedural due process in an application protest proceeding included access to the application and supporting data, the banks were entitled to have access to the hearing file under 10 Pa. Code &sect; 3.4. Section 302 (71 Pa. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the Pennsylvania General Assembly, named legislative leaders of both parties, the Governor, and the Treasurer, filed preliminary objections to the original jurisdictional matter brought by petitioner, a resident taxpayer, challenging on constitutional grounds the availability to state legislators of anything of benefit beyond salary and mileage. Petitioner also challenged local grant monies and leadership accounts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The basic premise of this lawsuit was that state legislators had access to things that benefitted them beyond that which was expressly permitted by the Pennsylvania Constitution. Petitioner sought various forms of relief, praying for declarations that the challenged benefits were unconstitutional and for injunctions restraining the Treasurer from disbursing future monies for the challenged purposes. Petitioner also sought mandatory injunctions compelling the return of unspent monies in leadership accounts and requiring legislative leaders to cooperate with an audit by the Auditor General. As to the demurrers, the court noted that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had repeatedly rejected the position advanced by petitioner as to the claims based on Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 8. The court noted that petitioner did not allege that any change to salary and mileage was made that was received during the current term; therefore, no violation of art. II, &sect; 8 was stated. The court found that petitioner failed to make allegations against the Governor as well as failed to make sufficient allegations against the Treasurer. Standing on the part of petitioner had already been resolved in his favor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained, in part, the preliminary objections with regard to the claims against the Governor, those against the Treasurer, the claims for audit relief, and cost of living expenses. The court overruled the preliminary objections as to standing, failure to join, no case or controversy, injuries, and surplus. The court also sustained the demurrers except to the surplus claim and granted petitioner leave to file a second amended petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant leased two billboards on a landowner's property. The landowner applied for a zoning permit to perform site alteration work. The township's zoning officer issued the permit subject to the condition that the two off-premises advertising billboards leased by the applicant be removed within 30 days, as required by an ordinance. On appeal, the applicant asserted that application of the ordinance resulted in a taking of its property without just compensation, infringed on its right to free speech, and selectively discriminated against properties on which off-premises advertising signs were located. The court held that requiring removal of the billboards was not an unlawful taking since the discontinuance was triggered by choice and action of the landowner, not by any municipal action. The court found that the applicant presented no evidence or argument to support its assertion that the ordinance violated its right to equal protection by treating off-premises signage differently from other uses, and the ordinance did not attempt to regulate signage based on content or effectuate a total ban on commercial speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the District Attorney for York County, challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of York County (New York), which affirmed the Act 111 grievance arbitration award directing the District Attorney's office to refrain from scheduling work hours inconsistent with Article V of its Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with appellee, the York County Detectives Association (the union).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The CBA established that the workweek was to consist of five consecutive work days in a pre-established work schedule for a total of 40 hours per week. The regular work day consisted of 8.5 scheduled consecutive hours, which included an unpaid one-half hour lunch. After the District Attorney hired a detective to work a schedule deviating from those provisions, the union filed a grievance seeking compliance with the CBA. The arbitrator agreed with the union and sustained the grievance, concluding that 16 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1620 was not relevant to the matter and that the establishing the work hours was a matter separate from hiring, firing, or supervising employees since the parties negotiated the limitation on work hours. The District Attorney contended that, in light of the reservation of exclusive authority to hire, fire, and supervise its employees conferred by &sect; 1620, the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction, exceeded his powers, and impaired constitutional rights when he enforced the CBA. The court disagreed and upheld the arbitrator's decision, finding that work hours constituted a term or condition of employment and were a mandatory subject of bargaining under Act 111.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Appeal Board ruled that petitioner claimant was not entitled to benefits under the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act, 77 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 1-1041.4; 2501-2626, because his sole remedy was under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 901-950.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was working on a ship in a graven dry dock -- i.e., a dry dock dug into the land -- at the time he was injured. A workers' compensation judge (WCJ) found that the claimant's exclusive remedy was under the LHWCA because working on a ship in dry dock was a traditional maritime activity precluding access to Pennsylvania workers' compensation benefits. The claimant appealed, and the Board affirmed. The court, analyzing the legislative history of the LHWCA and the case law construing it, held that because the claimant was injured in a graven dry dock while the ship was not afloat, he was on land &quot;in a physical sense&quot; at the time of the injury and thus had access to both to both LHWCA and Pennsylvania workers' compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the WCJ and the Board's finding that the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act did not apply and remanded for a determination as to whether the claimant was entitled to benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an urban blight organization, challenged the order of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the decision of appellee, the Philadelphia Zoning Board of Adjustment, that granted a variance to appellee property owner in order for the property owner to erect five outdoor wrap around advertising signs on a vacant building. The property owner cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner's cross-appeal asserted that the city's sign ordinance was unconstitutional and sought to quash the organization's appeal based on a lack of standing. The court clarified that the organization had standing to appeal since retroactive application of the amendment to 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13131.1, which excluded taxpayers who were not detrimentally harmed by a decision of a zoning board from the definition of aggrieved persons who had standing to challenge a zoning board decision, would be unconstitutional in that it would deprive the organization of its initial right of appeal. In addressing the variance granted to the property owner, the court held that the board's finding that the property owner established hardship was in error because the loss of rental income from disallowed outdoor advertising signs was not an unnecessary hardship. Further, the court found error with regard to the board's conclusion, and the trial court's affirmance, that the five signs were not contrary to the public interest since a planning commission member testified that the signs violated various sections of the city's sign ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the property owner's motion to quash the organization's appeal and reversed the trial court's denial of the organization's appeal. The court also denied the property owner's cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A candidate filed suit alleging 25 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2911 of the Pennsylvania Election Code, which required a minor party candidate for statewide office to submit nomination papers containing signatures equal to two percent of the largest entire vote for any elected candidate in the last preceding state-wide election, violated the state and U.S. Constitutions. Objectors contended his challenge was barred by estoppel or laches.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Members of the candidate's party had unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 951 (25 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2911) of the Pennsylvania Election Code in federal court. The instant court held that the candidate was not estopped by the federal litigation, as he was not a party to it, nor was his suit barred by laches. The federal district and appellate courts, using the &quot;balancing test&quot; that applied in analyzing election statutes under the U.S. Constitution, had found that 25 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2911 was constitutional. The instant court agreed with their analysis, and reached the same conclusion under the &quot;free and equal&quot; clause of Pa. Const. art. I. &sect; V. In determining whether election statutes violated Pa. Const. art. I. &sect; V, a court was obliged to accord them a presumption of constitutionality, to be invalidated only for &quot;gross abuse.&quot; The legislature, by enacting 25 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2911, intended to make ballot access by minor parties difficult, under the guise of maintaining an &quot;uncluttered&quot; ballot. This did not constitute a gross abuse of its power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the &quot;two percent&quot; requirement of 25 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2911 did not violate the U.S. Constitution or Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; V.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. IV, &sect; 16 barred the Governor from disapproving language in an appropriations bill. Respondents sought summary relief. The Treasurer and President filed preliminary objections; the latter moved to strike.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor disapproved seven items in the appropriations bill pursuant to Pa. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16.

The court held that language in the answer filed by respondents concerning communications between staff in the Governor's Office and staff in the legislature during budget negotiations did not violate the Speech and Debate Clause of Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 15, because the answer did not describe or refer to any legislative speech or debate. Petitioners' allegation, that parts of respondents' memorandum of law were scandalous and impertinent, failed because Pa. R. Civ. P. 1028(a)(2) allowed preliminary objections to &quot;pleadings&quot; alleged to contain scandalous or impertinent matter, and a memorandum of law was not a pleading. Respondents were entitled to summary relief under Pa. R. App. P. 1532(b) because Pa. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16 granted the Governor the power to disapprove the amount of the appropriation, the purpose for which the money was appropriated, or both. Pa. Const. art. IV, &sect; 15 provided the sole mechanism by which the legislature could restore appropriations disapproved by the Governor.</SPAN></P>

The voters alleged that the signatures in the nomination petition were obtained fraudulently. The candidate then withdrew his nomination petition, and the court ordered election officials to not certify the candidate for the primary election. Thereafter, the candidate launched a write-in campaign and won the Republican nomination for the seat. The voters then filed the instant motion alleging, among other things, that permitting the candidate to run in the general election was contrary to the court's earlier order. The court denied the motion because it found that election officials had fully complied with the earlier directive and had not certified the candidate's name as the Republican candidate in the primary election. The order related only to the primary election and did not preclude officials from certifying the candidate as the Republican nominee in the general election. Having received the majority of the votes, the candidate rightfully earned the party's nomination for the seat.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a group of hunters and outdoorsmen, filed an action relating to deer hunting against respondents, the Pennsylvania Game Commission, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR), and state officials, in which petitioners sought declaratory relief under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7531-7541 and mandamus. Respondents filed preliminary objections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that petitioners had standing under 34 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 322(c)(13), part of the Game Code, which clearly recognized the interests of sportsmen and protected an adequate opportunity to hunt and trap the Commonwealth's wildlife resources. Furthermore, petitioners had a substantial, direct, and immediate interest because they alleged that the Commission's policies and practices interfered with their ability to hunt by causing a depletion of the deer population. Next, based on the ambiguous nature of petitioners' pleading, it was not possible to discern a legal theory to support the relief requested. It appeared, however, that petitioners could state a claim for relief based on the Commission's alleged violations of its duties under &sect; 322(a), (c)(11)-(13): to protect and preserve game, serve the interests of sportsmen, and provide an adequate opportunity to hunt and trap. Accordingly, the court would not dismiss the complaint, but would allow petitioners to file an amended complaint under Pa. R. Civ. P. 1033. Finally, the DCNR, its secretary, and the Governor were not proper parties. There was no actual controversy between them and petitioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the preliminary objection to standing. It sustained the preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer and gave petitioners leave to amend their complaint. It sustained the preliminary objection to improper parties and dismissed the DCNR, its secretary, and the Governor from the action.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania) sustained the school district's appeal and increased the assessments. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer alleged that the trial court improperly increased the fair market value of the subject property. Among other things, the appellate court concluded that any lack of notice of the hearing was harmless as it did not prejudice the taxpayer, who had a fully opportunity to be heard. The appellate court further concluded that the increased assessment did not constitute an illegal spot reassessment in violation of the uniformity clause of Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&nbsp;1. The school district was not a body with power essential to the assessment process and thus, its use of a statutory appeal process did not constitute deliberate, purposeful discrimination in violation of the uniformity clause. The appellate court also found that the admission of the appraiser's supplemental report was proper since the report used the same evaluation criteria and methodology as the initial report, and the trial court held the record open to provide the taxpayer an opportunity to present evidence in response to the report. Finally, the appellate court disagreed that the trial court's decision was contrary to the evidence, noting that the taxpayer had stipulated to the appraiser's qualifications.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After respondent Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (Pennsylvania) rejected a bid by petitioner protestant on the grounds that the protestant had a record of noncompliance in state forest timber sales, the protestant filed a bid protest under 62 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1711.1. The Secretary of the Department denied the bid protest and affirmed the Department's decision to reject the bid. The protestant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After reviewing the parties' submissions, the Secretary found that no material dispute regarding the facts existed to necessitate the holding of a hearing on the bid protest. The protestant argued that the Secretary should have provided it with a hearing. The court stated that under &sect; 1711.1(e), the Secretary had sole discretion to decide whether a hearing was necessary to decide a bid protest. Here, none of the submissions to the Secretary raised any questions of material fact, and the protestant had failed to dispute the contents of the documents despite having been given the opportunity to comment on them. When the protestant failed to dispute the contents of the documents, the Secretary properly assumed that the protestant did not dispute their factual accuracy and that a hearing was unnecessary. This was especially evident where the protestant never challenged its inclusion on the Contractor Responsibility Program list of contractors who had defaulted. Next, because a disappointed bidder on a government contract had no right to have a contract awarded to it, due process was not violated by the failure of the Secretary to hold a hearing.</SPAN></P>

A tax upon &quot;leases&quot; in general was not prohibited, only leases that were made in the manner as described by &sect; 6902(1), which did not include the residential leases referred to in the ordinance. The taxpayer further alleged that the ordinance violated Pennsylvania's Uniformity Clause, Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, because it did not uniformly apply to all leases, but only residential to lease agreements, and that the borough did not provide any explanation for making the distinction. However, it was the taxpayer who had the initial burden of establishing that a reasonable distinction did not exist, and it did not plead any facts in support of its claim. Therefore, its constitutional challenge to the ordinance failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DPW posted a request for quotes (RFQ) on the Pennsylvania Department of General Services (DGS) website, seeking bids on a service contract. Before it did so, the vendor had written to BHA, expressing interest in performing that work. Because the vendor failed to update the vendor master list to reflect its new address, it did not receive the bid packet sent to it by DPW, which, after the packet was returned as undeliverable, tried, without success, to determine the vendor's new address. The vendor argued that its due process rights were violated because the lack of notice denied it the opportunity to bid. The court disagreed. DPW's failure to unearth the vendor's correct address did not estop DPW from relying on the statute of limitations to defend against the bid protest, as the burden to provide the address was on the vendor, not DPW. DPW complied with the notice requirements 62 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 512(c)(1) by posting the RFQ and the bidding instructions on DGS's website. And under 62 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A co-worker alleged the employee hugged her, rubbed his penis against her buttocks, and said he wanted to have sex with her. The employer fired the employee; the union filed a grievance alleging that the employer violated the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) by discharging the employee without just cause. The CBA did not define the term &quot;just cause.&quot; The arbitrator found that the employee sexually harassed the co-worker, but should not have been fired because (1) management condoned horseplay of a sexual nature, and (2) he stopped his harassment after being warned by a supervisor. The employer argued that the arbitration award was not rationally derived from the CBA because it deprived it of the ability to terminate an employee whose misconduct interfered with its ability to discharge one of its essential functions -- meeting its legal obligation to protect its employees from sexual harassment on the job. The appellate court agreed. The employee's conduct was so egregious that if the employer was unable to curtail it, it risked relinquishing control of the orderly functioning of its operations. It was not rational to conclude that the employer bargained for such a result.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorneys challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 214 (43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 774) of the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law, 1936 Pa. Laws 2897, 43 Pa. Stat. Ann &sect;&sect; 751-914. The trial court struck the allegation that &sect;&nbsp;702 (43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;862) of the Law had been amended. The attorneys had standing to challenge 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;774 as they had been negatively impacted in a direct fashion by it. The attorneys' interest was substantial as the general public did not have a license to practice law. Their interest was direct and immediate as &sect; 774 authorized non-attorneys to practice law in competition with them. The attorneys also had standing under the exception for issues that might otherwise go unchallenged. The attorneys also had standing as individuals who had taken an oath and pledged to defend Pennsylvania's Constitution. Finally, &sect;&nbsp;774 violated Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 10 as &sect; 10 gave the state's highest court the exclusive jurisdiction over matters relating to the practice of law. Whether special circumstances existed that justified the representation of corporations in unemployment proceedings by non-attorneys was for the state's highest court to decide.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board's first preliminary objection to the amended petition was granted and the references to &sect; 702 (43 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a minor by his parent and natural guardian, challenged an order of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), dismissing his negligence claims. The issue was whether the Charter School Law, 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 17-1701-A - 17-1751-A, granted the same immunity that political subdivisions and local agencies enjoyed under the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8541- 8542.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was injured while using his locker in a hallway while other students were playing in the hallway. Appellant contended that the school was negligent because it had failed to post hall monitors in the hallway. The lower court granted the school's motion to dismiss based on its immunity and the instant appeal followed. The court held that because the school, a Charter School, was so closely intertwined with the local school board, and because charter schools were exempt from certain regulatory requirements and were subject to statutes applicable to public schools, the lower court had properly determined that charter schools were immune from tort liability as political subdivisions or local agencies. In addition, appellant had raised a constitutional challenge, contending that the open courts provisions of Pa. Const. Art. I, &sect; 11 required that he be allowed to sue, which contention the court rejected, observing that the constitutional provision also provided for sovereign immunity and legislative regulation of suits against the Commonwealth. In addition, because the constitutional challenge was actually a facial challenge, notice to the Attorney General had been required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Common Pleas Court of the County of Lawrence (Pennsylvania) that found her guilty of interference with the lawful taking of wildlife, in violation of 34 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2302(a.1)(2), (7) of the Hunter Harassment Statute; defendant claimed, inter alia, that the Commonwealth did not establish that she violated the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant neither hunted nor permitted hunting on her property, and posted it each year. Nevertheless, she often observed hunters armed with rifles on her property. In December of 2001, defendant confronted various hunters screaming and yelling that they should get out because they were either trespassing on her property or illegally hunting. Within the span of one week, defendant received five citations for hunter harassment. The appellate court found that the trial court completely disregarded testimony relating to the legality of the hunting or the trespass on defendant's property. Defendant believed, either rightly or wrongly, that the hunters were engaging in the unlawful taking of wildlife, and merely sought to warn them not to trespass on her property or hunt illegally near her farm. There was nothing in the record to indicate that defendant ever knowingly interfered with lawful hunting. Because the Commonwealth's evidence failed to support a finding that defendant acted with the intent to interfere with the lawful taking of wildlife, the trial court erred in finding her guilty of violating &sect; 2302(a.1)(2), (7).</SPAN></P>

Appellants, a school district, a borough, and a property owner, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county entered into an agreement with the corporation through which the county assigned to the corporation many tax liens. The transfer of rights included all rights that the county had to collect and enforce such tax liens. Pursuant to the agreements, the corporation sought to obtain payments of the delinquent taxes; however, after failing to do so, it initiated proceedings against the properties. No owners contested the claims, and the court entered judgment for the corporation. After failing to obtain the judgment amounts, the corporation initiated an action to sell the properties at the &quot;upset price&quot; through sheriff's sales, which involved a bid that minimally covers costs, expenses, and all taxes and municipal claims. No party bid on the properties. The failure to received bids triggered the provision of so-called &quot;second sales&quot; of the properties to the highest bidder unencumbered by any lien, judgment, or other property interest. The trial court granted the corporation's petition for a rule to show cause allowing it to make such sales. On appeal, the appellate court found the petition was correctly granted because the law authorized the corporation to make such sales.</SPAN></P>

The board found the ordinances valid and denied the variance request based on evidence that the applicant's proposed expansion would increase truck traffic and adversely affect the environment. The appellate court held that as the applicant made both a variance request and a validity challenge in a single application and presented evidence relating to both in its case-in-chief, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10908(9)'s 100-day requirement for completing a hearing did not apply and the variance request could not be &quot;deemed approved.&quot; The setback and height requirements were not preempted by the Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management Act. Substantial evidence supported the board's conclusions. The ordinances were not unconstitutional because they did not result in the arbitrary confiscation of the applicant's property. In view of credible testimony that the applicant could operate the landfill at a profit while complying with the setback and height requirements, it failed to show that the ordinances imposed unnecessary hardship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer filed an amended petition for review under the original jurisdiction of the trial court (Pennsylvania) seeking a declaratory judgment that respondent Pennsylvania Auditor General failed to perform an audit of the Pennsylvania general assembly in violation of his duties. Respondents, including the general assembly and the Pennsylvania Legislative Audit Advisory Commission, filed amended preliminary objections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer averred that because of Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 10, the general assembly insulated itself from being independently audited and that the Auditor General's refusal to conduct such audits was based on an erroneous legal interpretation that he had no such duty. The trial court held that the taxpayer had standing to bring the action. Section 10 did not give any inherent power to the Auditor General to audit the general assembly; there was no other constitutional provision authorizing such an audit. The Pennsylvania Fiscal Code did not provide any such authority. If there was any doubt as to whether 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 402 authorized the Auditor General to audit the general assembly, that was removed when 1970 Pa. Laws 442 (Act 151), as amended, 71 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 1189.1-1189.2, was enacted, detailing how the audits of affairs of the general assembly were to be conducted. Under Act 151, that power was given to the Commission, which hired an accounting firm to audit the accounts. Finally, the separation of powers doctrine prohibited such an audit. There was absolutely no support provided anywhere authorizing the Auditor General to conduct an audit of the general assembly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owner sought review of an order from the Environmental Hearing Board (Pennsylvania), which granted the motion by respondents, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and a water authority, for partial summary judgment on issues raised in the owner's amended notice of appeal. The matter arose from the DEP's issuance of permits for fluoridation facilities at water treatment plants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority filed permit applications with the DEP for construction of fluoridation facilities at water treatment plants. The DEP issued the requested permits, including a construction and operations permit for one of the facilities. The owner and the city appealed and challenged the DEP's grant of the operations permit. Respondents' partial summary judgment motion was based on the lack of arguments on appeal as to the issuance of the construction permit, at which stage the concept of fluoridating the public water supply was approved. Accordingly, respondents claimed that issues raised that dealt with that issue were precluded by the doctrine of administrative finality. The Board granted the motion, and the owner sought review. On appeal, the court agreed with the Board's decision, as the owner was an aggrieved party at the time of the issuance of the construction permit and the matter was ripe for adjudication with respect to constitutional claims. His failure to have timely appealed the fluoridation decisions at that time resulted in the preclusion to raise them in an untimely fashion after issuance of the operations permit pursuant to 25 Pa. Code &sect;&sect;&nbsp;109.503 and 109.504.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, denied appellant taxpayer, an Internet service provider, a refund of sales and use taxes paid on purchases of equipment and of access to wirelines. The taxpayer appealed. The reviewing court affirmed the Commonwealth's determination; the taxpayer filed exceptions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer bought equipment to route customer data to its intended destination and to analyze incoming data. It did not own its own wirelines, but bought services from telecommunications carriers. The court held that as the operations performed by the equipment did not fall within the definition of &quot;manufacturing&quot; in the Pennsylvania Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 7101-10004, the equipment purchases were taxable. That equipment purchases by cable companies and facilities-based Internet service providers were not taxed did not violate the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution (Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1), because such entities were regulated to a different degree than non-facilities-based Internet service providers like the taxpayer. As the taxpayer was not a &quot;public utility&quot; with regards to its provision of Internet services, it could not claim a refund under the theory that it provided public utility Internet services. Under 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7201(rr)(3)(B), its purchase of wireline access to transport its customers' data to and from the Internet was taxable. The taxes were not proscribed by the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act, 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151.</SPAN></P>

In response to the hospitals' petition, the commonwealth health department filed preliminary objections alleging that the substantive language in the relevant section of the particular appropriation bill was unconstitutional because it violated Pa.

It found that the appropriations bill impermissibly attempted to compel the commonwealth health department to undertake certain actions in a particular way and did not allocate funds to secure the performance of the regular and ordinary work of the commonwealth health department, which made the bill unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant township and appellee corporation cross-appealed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County (Pennsylvania), which reversed the decision of the township's zoning hearing board denying relief, and gave specific direction to the township board of supervisors concerning its pending review of the corporation's land development plan. The township challenged the trial court's interpretation of Valenti.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation asserted the unconstitutionality of the township's 1991 ordinance. The appellate court concluded that the trial court erred in its application of Valenti and of 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10508(4). Nothing in the statutory language suggested that a landowner was entitled to enjoy the selective application of ordinance changes beneficial to its pending application while ignoring adverse changes in favor of an old ordinance. Allowing a hybrid application of the least restrictive provisions of old and new ordinances simply because of the timing of a land development application served no legitimate purpose. In addition, the corporation's evidence in support of the invalidity of the township's 1991 ordinance consisted entirely of testimony by its engineer, who opined that neither sand mound sewage systems nor drip irrigation systems required a lot size of 100,000 square feet. The corporation's evidence did not establish that the larger lot requirement produced the exclusionary effect prohibited by the state supreme court. Nor did this evidence establish that the lot size requirement was unreasonable, arbitrary or not sufficiently related to proper zoning purposes.</SPAN></P>

The licensee petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee held a license to practice medicine in Pennsylvania. He owned a medical facility in Pennsylvania. He traveled to Michigan to obtain additional training after reviewing a doctor's detailed website.

The doctor was there, was scrubbed, and was wearing a surgical gown. The doctor was also holding a surgical device and was shown on the videotape performing an invasive procedure. However, the doctor was not licensed to practice medicine in Pennsylvania. A hearing examiner found that the licensee should not be disciplined for knowingly allowing the doctor to practice unlicensed medicine in Pennsylvania. The state medical board reversed and ordered that the licensee be disciplined. On further review, the trial court found that the licensee was subject to discipline under the Medical Practice Act of 1985, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 422.41(7) because he knowingly allowed an unlicensed doctor to practice medicine in Pennsylvania and the doctor was acting as more than a consultant at the time of the infraction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent credit unions notified respondent Pennsylvania Department of Banking of their intent to expand their fields of membership to geography-based community credit unions under 17 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 501(e)(2). The Department allowed petitioner banks to intervene in order to oppose the request. Later, the Department dismissed the banks as intervenors and permitted conversion of membership fields for two credit unions. The banks sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The banks argued they would be harmed if tax-exempt credit unions could offer bank-like services in regions of Pennsylvania without the same regulatory scrutiny that was applied to banks. The Department, after allowing the banks to intervene, dismissed them for failing to prove standing during the hearings. The banks claimed that under 1 Pa. Code &sect; 35.31, intervenor status, once granted, could not be revoked and no further proof of standing could be compelled. The court held that &sect; 35.31 did not support this claim. Without an express statutory direction, a financial institution that was not governed by the Pennsylvania Credit Union Code had to satisfy traditional tests for standing to challenge administrative actions under the Code. As the banks and credit unions were regulated by separate statutes, the banks, in seeking to intervene in the credit union administrative proceedings, could proceed to a hearing on averments of competitive injury, but under Pa. Code &sect; 35.28(a), they had to prove some possible harm. There was no proof of possible harm because the banks did not establish that they had an interest that would be directly affected by the Department's conversion orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders dismissing the banks from further participation in the administrative proceedings and revoking their status as intervenors were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners owned property adjacent to a school. When negotiations concerning the purchase of the property between the landowners and the school district broke down, the school district acquired the properly by condemnation, and the jury awarded the landowners $ 325,000 for the property. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of the parties' pre-condemnation negotiations for the sale of the property, which included the school district's offers of $ 280,000 and $ 260,000, because such evidence was prohibited by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 1-705(2)(i). The two written communications indicated that the school district offered the property owners $ 280,000 and $ 260,000 as part of a proposed settlement in advance of condemnation proceedings. The trial court also erred by not permitting the landowners' expert appraiser to value the property using the subdivision development method. The expert valued the property as a whole but arrived at the ultimate value of $ 690,000 by starting with the values of individual lots and adding and subtracting other values and expenses, calculated over the projected time period needed to subdivide and sell the lots.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant began receiving benefits for a work-related injury.

However, the claimant died about two weeks before the hearing of a condition unrelated to the work injury. The workers' compensation judge decided that the employer should be granted permission to withdraw the petition. The workers' compensation appeal board entered an order that affirmed that decision. On further review, the appellate court found that no error occurred in allowing the petition to be withdrawn, as the workers' compensation judge would not be able to determine at a hearing pursuant to Pa.

Defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendants required the inmate to cut off his dreadlocks, he filed suit, alleging that the hair regulation, which limited &quot;Afro styles&quot; to four inches, violated his constitutional rights. The court granted defendants summary judgment on the inmate's freedom of religion claim because defendants' infringement on defendant's rights was permissible, as it advanced a valid penological objective and did so reasonably. A security officer explained in an affidavit that limiting hair length eliminated the use of long hair to conceal and move contraband, aided staff in the identification of inmates, and advanced inmate hygiene, and the inmate offered no evidence in rebuttal. The court also granted defendants summary judgment on the inmate's claim that the regulation discriminated against African-Americans because the &quot;Afro style&quot; could be worn by a person of any race. The regulation permitted a variety of hairstyles that did not fall below the collar and clarified that to meet that standard, Afro styles could not exceed four inches, based on differences in hair texture. The standards achieved the same end in keeping hair fairly, but not unreasonably, short for all inmates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a state employee, appealed an order from the Common Pleas Court of the County of Dauphin (Pennsylvania), which sustained the preliminary objections of defendants, the Pennsylvania State Police and individual state officials, on the basis of sovereign immunity and dismissed a complaint alleging invasion of privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee alleged that her personal affairs were improperly investigated in connection with her application for a promotion. She sought declaratory and injunctive relief preventing the use of information gathered as a result of the investigation, as well as preventing any further investigation until such time as appropriate training, guidelines, policy, restrictions, and procedures were developed. She also sought monetary damages from an official for failing to take corrective action. The court held that any duty on the part of the official to supervise the investigation was a duty within the scope of his employment, as to which he was absolutely immune from liability in accordance with 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2310. Immunity also applied with respect to training and other corrective action because sovereign immunity precluded mandatory injunctions to compel affirmative action by the state. Declaratory relief regarding matters barred by immunity would be improper. The trial court erred, however, in dismissing the request for injunctive relief restraining the use of the investigative report; this request was not barred by sovereign immunity because it sought to restrain conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal of the portion of the complaint that sought injunctive relief restraining the use of the investigative report and remanded for further proceedings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Authority prepared a redevelopment proposal in which it sought to acquire land in a blighted neighborhood, including the owner's property, inter alia, for the organization to build a school.

The appellate court held, inter alia, that the trial court erred in holding that when the owner's land was certified as blighted, the authority could transfer it to private development no matter &quot;who&quot; the future developer might be. The owner's failure to challenge the certification of blight did not effect a waiver of her challenge to the taking. The taking implicated an impermissible entanglement of church and state in violation of the Establishment Clauses in Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 3.U.S. Cons. amend. I. Consequently, the trial court erred in denying the owner's preliminary objections filed pursuant to 26 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-406(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed his assessment appeal challenging a decision by appellee county board of assessment appeals to apply the established predetermined ratio, instead of the common level ratio, to calculate the assessment value of the taxpayer's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board rejected the taxpayer's appeal of an assessment on his real property, finding the assessment value was equal to the property's fair market value. The board determined that the county's predetermined ratio (PR) under &sect; 1.1 of the General County Assessment Law (GCAL), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5342.1, was 100 percent, so application of the PR to the fair market value did not establish a different property value for assessment purposes. The trial court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the common level ratio (CLR) of 86.3 percent, rather than the PR of 100 percent, should have been applied. The taxpayer raised the same argument on appeal. The court declined the taxpayer's invitation to reject the established Park Terrace methodology for determining whether a CLR varied by more than 15 percent from the PR and it found that, since the CLR of 86.3 percent did not vary by more than 15 percent from the PR of 100 percent, the PR applied. Since the county's CLR fell within the 85 to 115 percent window of the county's 100 percent PR, &sect; 9(a.1) of the GCAL, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5350(a.1), required the board to use the PR to determine the assessment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner appealed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County (Pennsylvania), which granted appellee township's petition for counsel fees and costs in the amount of $ 28,493. The underlying litigation involved the enforcement of a township zoning ordinance against the property owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the property owner raised numerous issues. The appellate court concluded that 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10617.2 and South Whitehall Township, Pa., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 12.9(b)(1) did not deny equal protection of the law or fail to provide due process. Thus, both provisions were constitutional. The rational basis test requirements were met where: (1) enforcement of a zoning ordinance to ensure that the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community were protected was a legitimate state interest, and (2) the provisions were designed to promote the early resolution of zoning violations. In addition, the property owner was not the prevailing party because the township was successful on three of the four counts. Also, the fee award was proper commencing with the enforcement notice. Finally, the property owner presented no evidence to challenge the accuracy and reasonableness of the hours charged. Thus, he waived his right to challenge the reasonableness of the fees charged. Because the counts were tried in a single proceeding, it was the property owner's burden to establish a basis for segregating the hours spent on the successful and unsuccessful counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's denial of the city's motion for summary judgment concluded that the city could be liable if the State of Pennsylvania courts created a cause of action under Pa.

The trial court also determined that the city was not immune from the suit because the legislature did not have the power under the constitution to take away a state constitutional right. The city maintained on appeal that it was immune from the suit alleging excessive force under Pennsylvania's Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act. 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8541. The court acknowledged that the Pennsylvania Constitution did afford greater protection than the Fourth Amendment under certain circumstances but that such greater protection did not extend to where the government uses excessive force during a seizure. The court noted that the arrestee had an alternative remedy of pursuing such as a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 but that creating a new cause of action under Pa. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant, a retiree, petitioned for review of a decision of the Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement Board (SERB), which denied the retiree's request to convert his 14.5250 years of service credit earned as a Pennsylvania senator from Class A to either Class D-4 or Class AA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retiree served as a state senator from 1974 until 1988. The retiree later served as a judge. An amendment to 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. 5101-5956 added two new classes of service, AA and D-4. When he reached mandatory retirement age, the retiree sought to have his service credits transferred to one of the new categories. The appellate court held that the trial court properly denied Class D-4 status as the retiree was not a member of the General Assembly during the relevant time periods under 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5306.2(a). However, the appellate court held that the trial court erred in denying Class AA status. The retiree was similarly situated with individuals who were included in Class AA status as the retiree paid Class A contributions during a 20-year period of outstanding investment performance. The legislature essentially gave the additional earnings on the retiree's contributions to other state employees. The appellate court held that this was not reasonably related to accomplishing the purpose of the amendment. Therefore, SERB violated the retiree's equal protection rights by denying his request to convert to Class AA service.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner publisher appealed an order by respondent Board of Finance and Revenue (Pennsylvania) that denied its request for relief from a sales and use tax deficiency; the publisher claimed that because its publications were direct mail advertising literature or materials, pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 7204, it was not liable for taxes on the fees paid to independent printers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The publisher produced a variety of publications that were devoted to particular segments of the medical and healthcare industry, which were distributed free of charge. The publisher's revenues were derived from charges paid by those advertising in the publications. Following an audit, the Board determined that the publisher was liable for the use tax on the printers' charges for magazines because the publisher was advertising for other companies rather than on its own behalf. Consequently, the Board concluded that all printers' charges were subject to tax under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 7202(a), (b). The court held that the &quot;direct mail advertising&quot; exemption in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 7204 applied to advertising literature and materials that were delivered directly to the intended recipient once placed in the United States mail; the advertising materials did not need to be mailed by the vendor. Accordingly, the Board erred in concluding otherwise and taxing the printing charges paid by the publisher.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prison conditions litigation action, appellant inmate appealed an order of the Greene County Common Pleas Court (Pennsylvania) denying his request to proceed in forma pauperis. The case had been remanded from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which had decided that the denial of the inmate's request to proceed in forma pauperis was final and appealable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's request for in forma pauperis status was denied under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6602(a)(2)(ii) because the average monthly deposits for the six month period preceding the petition exceeded the amount of the filing fee. The high court found that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6602(a)&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated that court's rulemaking authority under Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 10(c) because 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6602(a) contravened the mandate in Pa. R. Civ. P. 240. On remand, the appellate court found that it was unable to conduct an effective appellate review of the case. Because 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6602(a) was declared unconstitutional, the proper standard for determining whether the inmate was entitled to in forma pauperis status was set forth in Pa. R. Civ. P. 240. Thus, a new decision following the standards set forth in Pa. R. Civ. P. 240 was required before the appellate review could be conducted. Furthermore, the trial court was required to note the actual amount of the filing fee so that the appellate court would be able to determine whether the inmate had sufficient funds in his prison bank account to proceed with his lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was vacated, and the case was remanded. On remand, the trial court was to note the actual amount of the filing fee when it issued a new decision regarding whether the inmate was entitled to in forma pauperis status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought a declaration that an amendment to 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2710 (Act 143) was unconstitutional as violative of the legislative process mandated by Pa. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, 3 and 4. They also sought to enjoin enforcement of Act 143. Respondents, the Commonwealth and various officials, filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer to petitioners' amended petition for review filed in the court's original jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents argued that petitioners failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. Two officials argued that petitioners' challenge to the constitutionality of Act 143 was non-justiciable. The court concluded that the constitutionality of Act 143 was justiciable because Pa. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, 3 and 4 were mandatory directives governing the manner of passing legislation by the Pennsylvania General Assembly and not mere general guidelines. Act 143 began as a bill regarding the criminal offense of agricultural crop destruction, but as passed it expanded the scope of the offense of ethnic intimidation. Petitioners argued that the title of the bill was misleading because the concept of &quot;ethnicity&quot; in the title could not reasonably include &quot;sexual orientation, gender or gender identity&quot; protected by the amendment. The court concluded that a determination of whether the original purpose of the bill was changed by the amendment or whether its title was deceptive and failed to clearly put a reasonable person on notice of the actual contents of the bill could not be made at the preliminary stage of the litigation and therefore required further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court were the preliminary objections filed by respondents, the Governor, Edward G. Rendell, and the Philadelphia Parking Authority (the Authority), to a complaint filed by petitioners, the City of Philadelphia and its Mayor, John F. Street (collectively, the City), which challenged an amendment to the Parking Authority Law, 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5501-5517 (2001). The court was exercising its original jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendment supplanted the power of a mayor of a first-class city to appoint a parking authority governing board and placed that appointment authority in the governor. The core of the City's challenge to the statutory amendment was that it interfered with the City's home rule powers. The court noted that that issue was already determined by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which held that the Parking Authority Law was legislation extrinsic to the City's home rule powers and, thus, its amendment to transfer control of the Authority from the City to the Governor did not infringe upon the City's home rule powers. The issue at bar before the court was whether another amendment to the Parking Authority Law, namely Acts 22 and 9, which extended the Authority's administration of on-street parking in Philadelphia for 10 years, required a different conclusion. Deciding that it did not, the court sustained the preliminary objections. The court found no authority for the City's premise that parking was inherently a municipal function and concluded that on-street parking duties assigned to the Authority were not municipal functions governed by home rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained all preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer filed a complaint for refund under &sect; 1 of the Refund Law. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court held that the Refund Law was not independently retroactive and that the controlling decision did not meet the criteria for retroactive application. It granted summary judgment to the authorities. The taxpayer appealed, arguing that the Refund Law was independently retroactive. The court agreed. The Refund Law, under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5566b(b), clearly and unambiguously allowed a refund of taxes that were assessed based on an interpretation of a statutory provision that was later held to be erroneous, as long as a written claim for refund was filed within three years of the assessment. Since the taxpayer sought a refund within three years for taxes assessed under an erroneous interpretation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5020-201(a), it was entitled to a refund.</SPAN></P>

Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9791-9799.7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner argued that the inmates failed to state a cause of action for which relief could be granted. Specifically, the Commissioner argued that, as Megan's Law II involved neither fundamental rights nor proceeded on suspect lines, it was accorded a strong presumption of validity and would be upheld so long as there was some plausible reason for the legislative action. The court concluded that the inmates failed to aver the prerequisite for substantive due process review because they did not specify which property right or other protected interest was deprived by Megan's Law II. The classification created by Megan's Law II--convicted sexual offenders as a category of felons--was not based on a suspect class. Nor did the classification affect any fundamental rights. As such, Megan's Law II was subject to the rational basis test. The court found that both prongs of the rational basis test were satisfied. First, Megan's Law II sought to promote the legitimate state interest of public safety and welfare pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9791(a). Second, the classification of convicted sexual offender was reasonably related to enhancing public safety and welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for a county before becoming a state employee. While he was able to convert the years of service with that county to his pension with the state retirement system, he also sought to convert 14 years of service with another county as well. The hearing examiner found that 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5303.1 limited the employee's right of conversion to that pension plan in which he was a contributor &quot;immediately prior&quot; to becoming a state employee. The board held that 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5303.1(a) limited the transfer to a single &quot;retirement plan,&quot; i.e., the one in which the employee was a contributor at the moment of transfer. The appellate court agreed. The employee's vested rights in the prior county pension system were unaffected; his annuity account continued to accrue interest until he reached age 60. To convert county service time to the state retirement system, all of that county service time had to have been rolled into the single retirement system in which the employee was a contributor &quot;immediately prior&quot; to his transfer to state employment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seller filed requests for sales tax refunds it had paid on various vehicles that it was required to repurchase from dissatisfied customers under the state automobile lemon law. The appellate board, in separate cases, rejected requests for refunds where the original purchaser had paid the sales tax more than three years before the date the seller filed the refund petition with the appellate board. The seller appealed. The Board of Finance and Revenue (Board) consolidated the appeals for disposition. Seller argued before the Board that its due process rights were violated by enforcing Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 10003.1(a)'s three-year statute of limitations for filing a refund request; it explained that the statute placed the seller in the anomalous position of having the statute of limitation on its right to a refund expire before the right to request that refund even accrued. The Board denied the appeals. On further review, the appellate court found that the statute was a statute of repose, and, once the time for filing a refund expired, there was no longer a &quot;right&quot; to process, even in cases where the refund right did not accrue within the limitations period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a limited liability company, billboard owners, and a billboard advertiser (billboard owners), appealed from the denial by the Common Pleas Court of the County of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) of their motion for a special and preliminary injunction enjoining appellees, a City, the acting commissioner of its Department of Licenses and Inspections, and the commissioner of its Department of Revenue, from enforcing a billboard excise tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The excise tax required the billboard owners to collect an excise tax on the consideration paid for the purchase, rental, or licensing of space on any billboard. The owners were liable for any taxes they failed to collect, plus penalties and interest. The trial court held that Adams Outdoor Advertising was controlling as to whether the billboard excise tax targeted a select group, whether the ordinance was narrowly tailored, whether the ordinance placed content-based burdens on speech, and whether the ordinance and tax violated the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The billboard owners' other constitutional claims, that the billboard excise tax violated free speech protections, that the billboard excise tax was not imposed on all off-premises signs, and that certain exempted categories were content-based, required the trial court to engage in further fact-finding and analysis. As the record existed, the billboard owners did not show a likelihood that they would prevail on these arguments, and the trial court did not err in denying the motion for a special and preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, dated September 17, 2004, is hereby AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant delinquent taxpayers challenged the addition by appellee law firm of attorney collection fees to delinquent tax claims. The taxpayers appealed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which denied their motion for summary judgment and granted the law firm's motion for partial summary judgment. The trial court's certified order for appeal by permission was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was the constitutionality of a retroactive amendment to the Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect;&sect; 7101-7505, which permitted recovery of reasonable attorney collection fees in addition to delinquent property tax. The appellate court concluded that the taxpayers had an accrued cause of action for declaratory judgment by the time they filed suit, and that the requested declaration would be unavailable if the amendment was applied retroactively. However, the request for declaratory relief contained a fatal jurisdictional flaw where the taxpayers neither joined nor served any taxing authority. In addition, application of the amendment to the taxpayers' unjust enrichment cause of action would remove any argument that enrichment was unjust, thereby effectively extinguishing the cause of action. Thus, the amendment affected this cause of action in a way prohibited by Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and the trial court erred when it concluded otherwise. Finally, no cause of action for fraud accrued before the amendment was enacted because the taxpayers did not plead reliance on the law firm's representations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded for dismissal of the declaratory judgment count. The grant of partial summary judgment was affirmed as to the unjust enrichment claims relating to attorney's fees actually received by the law firm after enactment of the amendment, but was reversed as to attorney's fees actually received before enactment of the amendment. The order of the trial court was affirmed as to the fraud count.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents appealed the judgment from the Common Pleas Court of the County of Dauphin (Pennsylvania), which dismissed their wrongful death and survival actions with prejudice because they were barred by the two-year statute of limitations, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5524(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' teenage son died in 1995 after contracting both rotavirus and staphylococcus infections. Nearly eight years later, they filed suit alleging that their son's death was caused by prolonged exposure to sewage sludge from a neighboring farm. They asserted that they could not reasonably know until 2001, when they read an article discussing the connection between sewage sludge and infections, how their son had contracted the infections that caused his death. Relying on the Pennsylvania supreme court's ruling in Pastierik, the trial court dismissed the suit, finding that the discovery rule, which tolled the statute of limitations until a time when a tort victim could discover his injury and its cause, did not apply to wrongful death and survival claims. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that as a matter of constitutional law, statutes of limitation go to matters of remedy, not to destruction of fundamental rights. Because of the clear notice that death provides, combined with the ability to perform an autopsy to discover its cause, the court held that the two years prescribed by the legislature afforded a decedent's representatives a reasonable opportunity to bring suit.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer used computer software programs in connection with its business, and paid a software company for a two-year renewal of multiple licenses to use various canned computer software programs that it had previously purchased. The taxpayer petitioned for a refund of the sales tax paid in connection with the license renewals, which the Board denied. The taxpayer argued that 1997 amendments to the Pennsylvania Tax Reform Code of 1971 repealed the tax on canned software. The court noted that while the 1997 amendments deleted custom computer software from the definition of a &quot;sale at retail,&quot; thereby eliminating it as a taxable service, they did not indicate that &quot;tangible personal property&quot; no longer included canned computer software. Under the &quot;essence of the transaction&quot; test, which the court adopted, canned software was tangible property because the purchaser acquired an electronic copy of a computer program that was stored on a computer's hardware. The Pennsylvania Department of Revenue's statement of policy, 61 Pa. Code &sect; 60.19, properly interpreted the Code by stating that the sale of canned software remained subject to tax as the sale of tangible personal property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Act 57 of 2002 began as an Senate Bill (S.B.) 1089 and was introduced in the Pennsylvania Senate as an act amending the DNA Detection of Sexual and Violent Offenders Act (DNA Act).

The bill was then signed by the governor. Petitioners then filed suit alleging that the bill was unconstitutional. The court disposed of the Secretary's preliminary objections, finding that in order to pass muster, each subject in an act must be &quot;germane&quot; to the other subjects in the act and that it could not say that requiring DNA samples from incarcerated sex offenders bore a &quot;proper relation&quot; to joint and several liability for acts of negligence. The court then granted summary judgment in favor of petitioners, finding that it had quite properly required that both parts of S.B. 1089, regarding the codification and repeal of the DNA Act and joint and several tort liability, needed to relate to one single overarching subject in order to comply with the provisions of Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile students challenged a decision from the Common Pleas Court of the County of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), which denied their motion for summary judgment and granted a cross-motion for summary judgment by appellee school district on the students' class action for a declaration that &sect; 2134 of the Public School Code of 1949 (Code), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 21-2134, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the students were adjudicated delinquent, they were returned to the district. Under &sect; 2134(c) of the Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 21-2134(c), they were sent directly to alternative classrooms instead of regular classrooms. They brought a class action challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 2134(c), arguing it violated procedural due process, equal protection, and the special legislation provisions of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32. Summary judgment was granted to the district and the students appealed. The court found that the Code did not violate special legislation because Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 20, allowed the classification of school districts and stated that such classifications were general, not specific, legislation. However, the students had a procedural due process right to a hearing to challenge an alternative classroom assignment since Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 21-2134(c) created an irrebuttable presumption that returning delinquent students were barred from regular classrooms. The students were entitled to the informal hearing procedures that already existed in 22 Pa. Code &sect; 12.8(c) before a decision on whether were to be placed in alternative classrooms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment to the extent that it held that the Code was not unconstitutional special legislation. However, it otherwise reversed summary judgment. The court instead invalidated &sect; 2134(c) of the Code as unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Amended Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 57, &sect; 151(c) required that notary public applicants complete three hours of approved training. The Secretary took the amendment to mean that when current notaries filed for renewal of their terms, they were required to have completed the education requirement. The notary complied with the requirement prior to his renewal date. The state supreme court then ruled that the Secretary's policy was invalid and that only new notaries needed to fulfill the education requirement. The notary filed suit against the Secretary, arguing that the money he had to pay for the three hours of education constituted a taking under both the Fifth Amendment and Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10. Applying the Penn Central criteria, the court disagreed. The notary failed to detail any specific facts that constituted a significant economic impact on those who had been required to attend the required education before the Secretary's policy was invalidated. Further, the Secretary's decision was designed to follow the amended statute to promote the education of notary publics. Finally, as to claims against the Secretary himself, he was entitled to immunity under 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2310.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the county and its board of commissioners, appealed the judgment in mandamus of the Court of Common Pleas of Mercer County (Pennsylvania), which essentially determined that appellee county controller did not need to disperse part of a loan to a former county nursing home, and that the commissioners were not authorized to make the loan under the County Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect;&sect; 101-2399.73.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the central issue was whether the express authority to make an appropriation included the power to loan money. Relying on Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 2169, the commissioners argued that the county had the power to make an appropriation to a former county nursing home. The appellate court concluded that the term &quot;appropriation&quot; was generic, describing a process and not specifying a form. The term embraced the action taken by the commissioners. The loan was expressly authorized by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 2169 where the loan was made from public moneys and was set aside for an authorized public purpose--the support of a nonprofit corporation organized to give medical care to dependents of the county. In addition, while the County Code and the Pennsylvania Constitution limited the purpose of the appropriation in question, neither limited the form of the appropriation. Neither the Pennsylvania Constitution nor the County Code limited the power to place conditions or restrictions on the appropriation, such as gradual repayment. Thus, the trial court fell into error when it concluded otherwise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court, granting judgment in mandamus, was reversed. The case was remanded for the entry of judgment in favor of the commissioners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a school district and a township, in consolidated appeals from real estate assessments, sought review of a decision of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Delaware (Pennsylvania), which declined appellants' request that the assessed values of two commercial properties be increased.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two properties were a car dealership and a furniture store. Appellants challenged the trial court's conclusion that their expert witness testimony regarding the dealership was of insufficient weight to sustain the burden of overcoming the prima facie validity of its assessment. As to the furniture store property, appellants challenged the trial court's conclusion that the method by which assessments to appeal was determined was discriminatory and resulted in non-uniform taxation, contrary to Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The court reversed in part. The trial court considered the testimony from appellants' expert, and stating three reasons, found that it was not credible. Its statement of reasons was sufficient to support the trial court's finding. However, the trial court erred in finding &sect;&nbsp;1 tax uniformity violation. Appellants had the right to appeal the assessments under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5350i, and the law placed no restrictions on the &quot;methodology&quot; employed in determining whether to appeal. Further, the evidence established that the furniture store's fair market value exceeded its assessment. It was not discrimination to appeal the incorrect assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision regarding the appeal of the dealership assessment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporation, an Internet service provider (ISP), appealed the order of the Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue, which affirmed the decision of the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue (DOR) Board of Appeals denying the corporation's petition for a refund of sales and use tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the corporation raised several issues. The appellate court concluded that the data transport services (DTS) at issue met the definition of telecommunications service in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 7201(rr)(3) so as to constitute taxable tangible property because the corporation used the lines to transmit by wire digital signals containing the customer's message or information. In addition, the purchases of the DTS were not exempt under the resale exclusion of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 7201(k)(8) because the data lines, modems, and routers could not be incorporated into &quot;other tangible personal property&quot; as required by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 7201(i)(2) where Internet access was an intangible. Also, the DTS were not exempt under the public utility exception because ISPs were not public utilities defined under Pennsylvania law and were not subject to any form of regulation as a public utility by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. Finally, the DOR did not violate the Internet Tax Freedom Act, Pub. L. No. 105-277, Div. C., Title XI, &sect;&sect; 1100-1104, Oct. 21, 1998, 112 Stat. 2681-719, because ISPs were treated the same as telecommunications carriers and cable operators.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that the cats and foxes were exotic wildlife and would not be returned, but that the kinkajous and lemurs were not and would be returned. The owner appealed, arguing that her acquittal collaterally estopped the commission from arguing the animals were contraband and that none of the animals were contraband. On cross-appeal, the commission argued that the kinkajous and lemurs were contraband per se and should not have been returned. The court found that the owner's acquittal had no preclusive effect in her subsequent civil action for return of property. As to the parties' dispute over whether the animals were contraband per se, preliminary findings were first required on whether the owner had either a federal license or state permit to possess the animals, and whether the state regulations were preempted by the federal laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner school district sought review of a determination of an assessment bureau that six of its schools failed to make annual yearly progress (AYP) under the federal No Child Left Behind Law (Act), 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 6301 et seq. Respondent Department of Education dismissed the appeal. The school district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal to the Department was dismissed upon a motion which argued that the appeal violated the Department's new policy for the appeal of determinations of failure to achieve AYP. That policy allowed appeals based only on assertions that (1) the data upon which the Department made the determination were incorrect, (2) significant growth had been made toward meeting the goals of the Act, or (3) an unforeseen circumstance beyond a district's control prevented it from achieving AYP. The school district challenged the validity of the Department's implementation of the Act as it applied to the school district. The court found that this was proper since the Department was acting pursuant to powers granted to it by the Act. The Department violated the school district's due process rights when it limited the grounds upon which it could appeal the bureau's determination by intentionally misinterpreting the Act. The Department redefined the meaning given to an acronym in the Act to suit its own purpose of limiting the appeals of its decisions under the Act. Accordingly, the Department's appeal policy was an unconstitutional restraint on due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers appealed the order of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania) dismissing all counts of the taxpayers' second amended class action complaint that challenged a court order increasing property tax assessments by two percent and that asserted that appellee Allegheny County Board of Property Assessment, Appeals, and Review improperly implemented the increases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that a freeze in property tax assessments instituted, in part, by the Board was unlawful. The trial court later imposed a two percent increase in the assessed fair market value for all properties in the county for each of the 1999 and 2000 tax years. The taxpayers filed the instant class action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The trial court properly found that the taxpayers could not maintain a class action as they failed to pursue an adequate statutory remedy for a refund of the purportedly improperly collected taxes. The legislature provided an adequate statutory method, under Pennsylvania Refund Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5566b et seq., and under the Pennsylvania General County Assessment Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5020-101 et seq., for seeking a tax refund for improperly paid taxes. As a result, a class action remedy was not available. Likewise, because of this statutory remedy, the taxpayers could not seek a refund under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 based on a violation of due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence before the hearing examiner indicated that the employees, certified hazardous material responders, generally performed administrative work or responded to hazardous material calls. They also occasionally responded to fire scenes where there were existing or potential problems with hazardous materials. The hearing examiner found the employees had no legislative authority to act as firefighters. On appeal, the Board found that because they were trained and expected to respond to certain types of fires, they were &quot;firefighters&quot; under Act 111. The appellate court disagreed. Under the Pennsylvania Hazardous Material Emergency Planning and Response Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect;&sect; 6022.101-6022.307, hazmat employees had a limited statutory authority, if any, to act as firefighters because their primary purpose was to suppress the release of hazardous materials. The mere reference in training standards to situations where any given hazmat team might encounter a fire and should have training to deal with those situations was insufficient to legislatively authorize hazmat employees to be firefighters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney challenged orders of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania) that dismissed her petitions under 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 904 (&sect; 904 petition) and under 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 906 (&sect; 906 petition) to challenge an ordinance by respondent township to approve an election district reapportionment plan by respondent township board of elections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney challenged an ordinance approving the board's plan to reapportion election districts. The trial court dismissed the attorney's petitions and she appealed. The court found, as to the &sect; 904 petition, that once the board, as the township's legislative body, acted to reapportion the districts, the court lacked authority under 53 Pa. Cons. Stat &sect; 904 to reapportion the township by any judicial order. Also, the trial court properly held that the procedural challenge to the ordinance was untimely. The trial court properly dismissed those portions of the attorney's &sect; 906 petition that challenged the constitutionality of the reapportionment plan based on deviations because the maximum deviation between legislative districts was below 10 percent. Such a minor deviation failed to make out a prima facie case of discrimination. However, because alleged pleading deficiencies were not a ground for dismissal, the court had to vacate the trial court's order dismissing the &sect; 906 petition with respect to claims that the ordinance was constitutionally infirm because its districts were not compact and contiguous and did not incorporate distinctive geographical features in the township.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed dismissal of the &sect; 904 petition. The court vacated dismissal of the claims in the &sect; 906 petition that asserted violations of geographical boundaries standards and violations of the constitutional compact and contiguous standard and remanded for further proceedings on those claims, but otherwise affirmed dismissal of the &sect; 906 petition.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 101 et seq. Even if the field of hunting was preempted by the Code, preemption of Lancaster Township, Pa., Ordinance No. 50 did not occur as Lancaster Township, Pa., Ordinance No. 50 did not even mention hunting. The Code did not preempt the field of spotlighting. Lancaster Township, Pa., Ordinance No. 50 was not unconstitutionally vague. Spotlamp was defined as an illuminating device, either fixed or movable, intended to project a powerful concentrated beam of light. A person of reasonable intelligence was able to understand the difference between a flashlight and a spotlamp. Lancaster Township, Pa., Ordinance No. 50 was not overbroad.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmates filed an original petition for review against respondent attorney general, alleging that Megan's Law II, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9791-9799.7, violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9, 26, and Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. The attorney general filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer seeking dismissal of the petition for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition alleged that Megan's Law II was based on conclusions drawn from flawed premises. The attorney general argued, inter alia, that he was not a proper party since he did not have any responsibility to administer or enforce Megan's Law II and that the only other way he could be named as a proper party was if his own actions were at issue, which was not the case in the instant matter. The court found that, while the attorney general had a statutory duty pursuant to the Commonwealth Attorneys Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 71, &sect;&sect; 732-101 to 732-506, to uphold and defend the constitutionality of all statutes so as to prevent their suspension or abrogation, his duty to uphold the laws of the state, standing alone, did not suffice to render him a proper party in the instant action. In order to bring suit against the attorney general, the attorney general must have been the official who was charged with the enforcement and administration of Megan's Law II and, clearly, under the provisions of the statute, it was the Pennsylvania State Police who were charged with administering and enforcing the provision of Megan's Law II. The attorney general was not a proper party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility proposed the surcharge as the mechanism for funding infrastructure improvements to its wastewater collection systems. The advocate contended that any rate increase occasioned by utility's investment in its wastewater systems should not be automatic but, rather, should be established in a base rate proceeding. The PUC interpreted 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;1307(a) as allowing for such a surcharge. The court reversed. The surcharge would have been used to recover capital costs for new facilities. 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1315 required a showing that such facilities would be used and useful prior to recovering the capital costs. Because a Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1307(a) surcharge provided no opportunity for such a showing, a surcharge could be used to fund capital improvements. The PUC's approval of the surcharge under &sect; 1307(a) would allow the utility to recover its capital expenditures with only an initial and cursory review. Further, the surcharge was not authorized by &sect; 1307(g) because it dealt only with projects involving the distribution of water. To recover the costs for the improvements, the utility was required to file a base rate case pursuant to 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1308.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owner, individually and on behalf of all persons and entities similarly situated, commenced a class action against respondents, Pennsylvania's treasurer and treasury department. The property owner sought the payment of interest on property recovered pursuant to the Disposition of Unclaimed and Abandoned Property Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 1301.1-1301.28a.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their preliminary objections, respondents raised numerous issues. The court concluded that pursuant to the plain language of Pa. Stat.

In addition, where the statutory procedure was not followed, any putative class member who did not commence an action within the statutorily prescribed time was not entitled to recover interest. The mechanism for an aggrieved person to challenge an action of respondents under the Unclaimed Property Law was personal to &quot;persons aggrieved,&quot; and could not be transferred to others by way of a class action. Also, the delivery of the property owner's stock to respondents did not constitute a taking. It was the property owner's abandonment of his property, not the action of respondents, which caused his pecuniary loss. Finally, the Unclaimed Property Law did not expressly provide for the payment of interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county performed a county wide reassessment effective for tax year 2001. The property at issue, which consisted of 85 acres of unimproved land, was assigned a fair market value of $ 92,250.00. In April 2002, the taxpayers purchased the property for $ 170,000.00. The school district then appealed to the county board of assessment appeals, contending that the property's fair market value should be $ 170,000.00. The board then increased the property's fair market value to $ 161,900.00. After application of the county's predetermined ratio of 50 percent, the trial court set the assessed value of the taxpayers' property at $ 80,950.00. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the school district's use of the statutory appeal mechanism available uniformly to all interested parties through Pa. Stat. tit. 72, &sect; 5453.706 did not amount to deliberate, purposeful discrimination in violation of either Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 or U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 because the filing of a tax assessment appeal by a school district did not amount to an improper spot assessment and the application of the county's predetermined ratio satisfied the constitutional mandate requiring uniformity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, residents and taxpayers of a township, appealed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County (Pennsylvania), which granted a petition for a curative amendment to appellee property owners, permitting them to conduct a quarry-mining operation and other related activities in an A-1 Conservation District. In so doing, the trial court reversed the decision of appellee township board of supervisors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, appellants argued that the board's decision to deny the curative amendment was supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, they argued that any exclusion of mining was partial and, therefore, the case did not concern a de jure exclusion. The appellate court found that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 10603, taken as a whole, weighed and balanced several different interests in requiring zoning ordinances to reflect the policy goals of the community, and that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 10603(i) set out the reasonable development of minerals as one such interest. However, the statute required a balancing of interests to determine whether the township zoning ordinance was reasonable. The trial court did not consider any of the factors or balance the interests set out in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 10603, but rather focused only on the bare percentage of land that had not been already mined and was still available for mining in the Industrial District, found it to be negligible, and automatically granted site specific relief. This was error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court was vacated and the matter was remanded to the trial court with directions to remand the matter to the board for evaluation of the relevant statutory factors.</SPAN></P>

Laws 246, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect;&sect; 11701.101-.501. Respondents filed preliminary objections to the union's second amended complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted a financial recovery plan, including future changes in the city's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the union. The union filed suit pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7501-7541, seeking a declaration that &sect; 252 of Act 47, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 11701.252, was invalid and did not apply to arbitration awards entered pursuant to the Act of June 24, 1968, 1968 Pa. Laws 237, No. 111, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 217.4, which governed collective bargaining between the city and the union. Respondents attacked the union's complaint on legal sufficiency, ripeness, and jurisdictional grounds. The court sustained the objections. The non-city respondents could not be held liable for the city's plan. The fact that the city had helped the coordinator prepare the plan did not render it invalid. There was no ripe and justiciable controversy; the court could not determine whether the plan would actually impact the CBA until after the collective bargaining and arbitration processes. The court did not have original jurisdiction under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 761(a)(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Pennsylvania Driver's License Compact, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1581, appellant Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing (DOT), suspended appellee licensee's driving privileges for one year due to his conviction of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in Delaware. The Chester County Common Pleas Court (Pennsylvania) granted the licensee's appeal. The DOT sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DOT submitted a copy of a traffic complaint, issued by an alderman's court in Delaware, which indicated that the licensee pled guilty to DUI. Because the complaint did not come from Delaware's licensing authority, the trial court concluded the DOT failed prove an out-of-state conviction under the Compact. The appellate court disagreed. Even an out-of-state conviction report that did not strictly comply with the Compact's requirements required the DOT to suspend the person's license if the conviction qualified for suspension under the Compact. Under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1586, an out-of-state conviction for any level of impaired driving was punishable in Pennsylvania; therefore, Newark, Del., Mun. Code &sect; 20-57(a) (prohibiting driving while under the influence of alcohol) was substantially similar to the offense described the Compact and to Pennsylvania DUI laws. The DOT was not obliged to publish the Compact in the Pennsylvania Code or Pennsylvania Bulletin in order for it to become effective. The licensee argued that he was placed in Delaware's First Offender Program and thus was not &quot;convicted&quot; of DUI, but he failed to meet his burden to prove this claim.</SPAN></P>

The owner, a 76 year-old woman, had made several appointments for a euthanasia procedure in accordance with the doctor's long-standing recommendation, but she changed her mind each time she arrived at the doctor's office. Finally, the doctor performed the procedure, with the owner in attendance. The dog howled and collapsed, and the dog owner yelled at the doctor accusing him of killing her dog. She filed a complaint with the Department of State, Bureau of Enforcement and Investigations (Department) to complain about the manner in which her dog had been euthanized. When a Department investigator met with the doctor, the doctor phoned the dog owner and yelled at her rudely. The Department issued an order alleging that the doctor's conduct in verbally harassing the owner violated the Act. The Board found that the doctor had demonstrated &quot;professional incompetence.&quot; On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the doctor's rude behavior did not equal professional incompetence under the Act, rejecting the Board's attempt to treat unprofessional conduct and professional incompetency as identical concepts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary withheld payment based on the districts' alleged failure to make statutorily required payments to certain charter schools. The action was initially reversed because the Department's withholding of payments under &sect; 1725-A(a)(5) of the Pennsylvania Charter School Law was an &quot;adjudication,&quot; thereby obliging the Secretary to grant the districts a hearing pursuant to 2 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 504. After this ruling, the Department established an eight-step procedure to provide school districts with notice and an opportunity to be heard on the merits of such withholding. The districts did not participate in this procedure, and the Secretary again withheld the funds. The appellate court held the remand order did not contemplate the districts' forced participation in an informal paper process that the Department crafted after the remand. The remand order required nothing less than what &sect; 504 allowed, which included a stenographic record of the proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the Board argued that the bar waived its free expression challenge by failing to raise the issue below. The appellate court concluded that the issue of free expression was litigated sufficiently in the trial court so as to create a record adequate for appellate review. Issuing a liquor license on the condition that a licensee would not permit lewd, immoral, or improper entertainment on its premises did not violate the free expression provisions of either the United States or Pennsylvania Constitutions. The Twenty-First Amendment to the United States Constitution gave the states the absolute power over the conditions under which liquor was sold within their borders and even over whether it could be sold at all. Thus, the ban on lewd, improper, or immoral entertainment in the form of topless dancing in establishments licensed by the Board did not infringe on the rights guaranteed by Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7. However, the bar offered evidence that the language in 40 Pa. Code &sect; 1301 was subject to more than one possible reading. The regulation was vague and unenforceable because it did not establish what a licensee was permitted to do and what was forbidden.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authorities operated landfills under permits issued by the DEP. They asserted that they were municipal corporations entitled to a tax exemption as provided by the Municipality Authorities Act, 53 Pa. Cons.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 4101-4113, 6201-6306, was a tax despite its designation as a &quot;fee.&quot; Respondents argued that the plain language of Act 90 did not exempt the authorities, as the fee was on the disposal of solid waste, not on the solid waste itself. The court agreed with respondents and found that the practice under Act 90 was the same for all practical purposes as the practice under the pre-existing statutes, the Municipal Waste Planning, Recycling and Waste Reduction Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect;&sect; 4000.101-4000.1904, and the Environmental Stewardship and Watershed Protection Act, 27 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 6101-6113; the authorities were collecting and remitting the Act 90 disposal fees to the DEP, which did not treat publicly owned and privately owned landfills differently. The tax exemption provided under the Municipal Authorities Act did not apply to Act 90.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant residents challenged an order of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Armstrong (Pennsylvania), which dismissed their complaint. The residents brought suit challenging the constitutionality of a township ordinance requiring them to connect to a public water system. The trial court sustained the preliminary objections filed by appellees, a water authority, two townships, and a county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined the residents failed to state a cause of action in their complaint. The residents asserted that as a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and the nation's war on terrorism, there was a real and present danger of terrorist attacks on public water systems and that an ordinance mandating such a connection violated their substantive due process rights guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and their right to life guaranteed by Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court disagreed and noted that the residents' complaint failed to allege a direct, real, or immediate threat of harm, that it merely provided conjecture, and that no authority was cited to support their proposition that the right to privacy included the right to refuse to connect to a public water supply. The court pointed out that the ordinance did not force the ingestion of water from an unknown source, as it only required the residents to hook up to the water authority's system, not use the water. The court also established that the appropriate standard for considering the constitutionality of the ordinances was the minimum rationality standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The General Assembly directed the Secretary to submit ballot questions to Pennsylvania's electors seeking to amend two provisions of the state constitution. The first ballot question asked if the constitution should be amended to provide that a person accused of a crime had the right to be &quot;confronted with the witnesses against him,&quot; instead of the right to &quot;meet the witnesses face to face.&quot; The second question asked whether the constitution should be amended to allow the General Assembly to enact laws regarding the manner by which children could testify in criminal proceedings. The amendments passed. The attorneys then sought a declaratory judgment voiding the amendments. The court overruled the General Assembly's first objection, finding that it did have jurisdiction to review the legislatures' procedural compliance with Pa. Const. art. XI. However, it sustained the objections as to the merit of the attorneys' claims and concluded that the general assembly properly followed the procedures for amending the constitution as provided in Pa. Const. art. XI by publishing the proposed amendments and providing the Attorney General's statement explaining the purpose of the amendments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer testified that the licensee's car crossed over the center line and drifted into the oncoming lane of traffic before making a sharp left-hand turn. The officer stopped the car; the licensee emitted a strong odor of alcohol, had bloodshot and glassy eyes, slurred his speech, and failed sobriety tests. The officer arrested him for driving under the influence; the licensee refused to submit to chemical testing. The licensee argued that the officer lacked authority to stop him outside his jurisdiction. The appellate court disagreed. Under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8953(a)(4), the officer properly left his jurisdiction to arrest the licensee because the chief of the police departments of his town and the town where the arrest occurred had authorized the officers of the other department to enforce the traffic laws on the street in question. Further, the officer was in &quot;hot pursuit&quot; under &sect; 8953(a)(2), and under &sect; 8953(a)(5), the licensee presented a clear and present danger to persons or property. The licensee's erratic driving gave the officer probable cause to stop him, and even if it did not, his privileges could be suspended as suspension was a civil proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The attorney alleged that &sect; 998 violated Pa. Const. art. V, 10(c). The court held that the Board did not err in affirming the WCJ's determination that the documentary material and arguments proffered by the attorney did not support an attorney fee in excess of 20 percent. And as Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 998 did not bar a WCJ from permitting a higher fee agreement if the attorney showed that such a fee was commensurate with the attorney's efforts, and &sect; 998 was not inconsistent with any other rule promulgated by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that regulated the conduct of attorneys, it did not violate Pa.

The court could discern no rational reason to treat first-level supervisors of the Commission differently from first-level supervisors employed by any other public employer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Dauphin County Social Services for Children and Youth (SSCY) sought review of an order of respondent Pennsylvania Bureau of Hearings and Appeals (Bureau) of the Department of Public Welfare (DPW), which granted a motion by intervenor, an indicated sexual abuse perpetrator, to compel discovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A SSCY investigation indicated that intervenor had sexually abused a three-year-old. His counsel requested a hearing, and intervenor sought discovery. An initial motion compelling discovery was entered. Intervenor filed a second motion, asserting that he was entitled to discovery of additional information. The Bureau's second order provided intervenor with access to all information in the SSCY file relative to the investigation, including confidential information. The court reversed. The Bureau's reliance as a basis for its order on the right to confrontation found in Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and the Sixth Amendment was misplaced. The right to confrontation applied only in criminal cases and the expunction proceeding was civil in nature. There was no dispute that intervenor had received all information due him under 23 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation appealed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of York County (Pennsylvania), which denied the corporation's appeal from an order of appellee township zoning hearing board (ZHB) dismissing the corporation's procedural challenge to the validity of a zoning ordinance and a subdivision and land development ordinance. Appellee township filed a motion to dismiss the corporation's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Regarding the motion to dismiss, the corporation argued that under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 11006-A, a court could declare any ordinance invalid and set it aside regardless of whether the applicant had submitted plans or other material in the form required for final approval. The appellate court concluded that the corporation's proposal to use its property for non-coal surface mining and related accessory uses was sufficient to establish a right under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 11006-A to appeal the ZHB's denial of its challenge to the two ordinances. In addition, the ZHB did not violate the corporation's constitutional right to due process by holding a hearing solely on the jurisdictional issue because the jurisdictional issue had to be resolved before the ZHB could reach the merits of the challenge. Also, the ZHB did not err in determining that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5571(c)(5) barred the challenge as untimely because the challenge was filed more than four years after the last previous enactment of the zoning ordinance and more than seven years after the last previous enactment of the subdivision ordinance. The statute unequivocally stated that it applied to land use ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss the corporation's appeal was denied. The order of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From 1988 through 1997, petitioner accountants and their corporations sold approximately $ 60 million worth of unsecured debentures to 7,000 investors nationwide. The accountants sought review of the order of the Pennsylvania State Board of Accountancy, which revoked the first accountant's certificate of certified public accountant and biennial license and revoked the second accountant's certificate of certified public accountant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the accountants raised numerous issues. The appellate court concluded that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 2203(d), which required hearings to be held within 90 days after the date on which an answer was filed, was directory rather than mandatory. Thus, the cases did not have to be dismissed just because the Board failed to hold a hearing within 90 days after the accountants filed their answers. The Board did not err in finding that the accountants' right to practice before the Pennsylvania Securities Commission (PSC) was revoked. The accountants were barred from registration as broker-dealers under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 70, &sect; 1-301 and could not transact business as broker-dealers in Pennsylvania or appear before the PSC in that capacity. The Board's finding that the accountants engaged in unprofessional conduct under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 9.9a(a)(16) was not erroneous where the accountants violated 64 Pa. Code &sect; 305.019 by offering and selling certificates to investors without disclosing that the offers and sales were made in willful violation of Pennsylvania law. Finally, the accountants were collaterally estopped from relitigating the facts of the PSC adjudication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, an out-of-state new vehicle dealer, petitioned for review of an order of respondent Pennsylvania State Board of Vehicle Manufacturers, Dealers, and Salespersons, which determined that the dealer violated Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 818.32(c), imposed a civil penalty in the amount of $ 1,000, and directed that the dealer cease and desist from participation in vehicle shows, off-premise sales or exhibitions in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the dealer argued that (1) Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 818.32(c) did not preclude it from displaying vehicles at an event unless there were 49 similar dealers at the event; (2) the Commonwealth did not establish that less than 50 new vehicle dealers participated at the event; and (3) Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 818.32(c) violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The appellate court concluded that the Board did not err when it determined that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 818.32(c) prohibited the dealer from displaying its vehicles at the event because the statute clearly stated that an out-of-state new vehicle dealer could participate in shows where there were at least 50 new vehicle dealers participating as exhibitors. The Board's finding was supported by substantial evidence where the dealer was the only new vehicle dealer to participate at the event from 1999 through 2002. Because in-state new vehicle dealers were equally as burdened as out-of-state new vehicle dealers, the statute did not facially discriminate against interstate commerce. The statute was enacted for the legitimate purpose of protecting the Pennsylvania consumer from fraud and deception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A borough enacted an ordinance authorizing the incurrence of indebtedness pursuant to the Debt Act with respect to changes to its sanitary collection and treatment system. The three petitioners filed individual complaints, challenging the legality of the debt proceedings. Each of the actions were dismissed, and appeals were taken. The court deferred to the Department's interpretation of 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8022, wherein it held that a simultaneous incurrence and exclusion of debt was acceptable, and it found that preliminary cost estimates pursuant to 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8006 were not required because the costs of the original project were not involved, but rather, a refunding of the financing. The lack of a hearing on two of the petitioners' claims of fraud was proper, as allegations to support the claims were insufficient. The mayor's failure to sign the ordinance at the meeting was not a fatal defect because it was not vetoed. The borough was not required to provide one of the petitioners with the full text of the ordinance under 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8003(a), and accordingly, her claim that it was not lawfully enacted failed.</SPAN></P>

He was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 1993 and depression in 1995.

The counselor informed him of the requirement that he apply for disability annuity within two years of his last pay day. PSERS sent several newsletters to its members containing that same information. The teacher retired in June 1999 and submitted his disability annuity application to PSERS on November 28, 2001. PSERS denied the application because it was not received by June 2001. The Board upheld the decision. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the provisions of the Public School Employees' Retirement Code, 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8102- 8535, which defined &quot;active member&quot; and &quot;inactive member&quot; informed an ordinary person of their meanings and that the fact that the Code granted certain benefits to vestees and certain other rights to active and inactive members did not make it unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, adopted the recommendation of an administrative law judge to dismiss complaints filed against a water utility. The complainants requested the Commission to order the utility to install, at the utility's sole expense, water mains and a storage tank. The Commission held that his relief was not available to the complainants. Petitioner consumer advocate sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the consumer advocate raised several issues challenging the Commission's decision that township residents had to contribute to the cost of extending the utility's main to the township. The consumer advocate argued that where a need for public utility service was demonstrated, a utility had to invest in an extension of service even where the utility would experience a negative return on this investment. This shortfall would have to be borne by the utility's shareholders or by its existing customers, who already generated profits for the utility. The appellate court disagreed, holding that the consumer advocate could not show the Commission had exercised its statutory authority unlawfully. The standards adopted by the Commission, after much care and research, balanced the competing interests affected by a service extension. The line extension regulations did not conflict with 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1501 and, thus, had the force and effect of law. Further, they were properly applied. The Commission did not relieve the utility from having to extend service in the township, but only from having to do so on the conditions sought by the complainants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed the order of respondent Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, which denied the inmate's request for administrative relief and upheld the decision of the Board recalculating his maximum expiration date to April 14, 2005.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the inmate argued that the Board incorrectly recalculated his maximum date and that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 331.21a was void because it was unconstitutionally vague. The precise question was the effect of an intervening recommitment for technical violations only: was the street time prior to that technical recommitment insulated from forfeiture if a new crime was committed when the parolee was then re-paroled, or was that street time subject to forfeiture? Pennsylvania case law held that such street time was subject to forfeiture. In addition, the appellate court concluded that while it was true that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 331.21a(a) did not specifically address the sanction for new criminal actions committed while on re-parole, that factor alone did not create a constitutional infirmity, particularly where there was no reason that the standard would be any different from that applied to an initial parole. The clear intent of the provision was to discourage the commission of new crimes while on either parole or re-parole by imposing a costly sanction upon offenders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner shop owners filed a consolidated petition for review of an order of respondent Pennsylvania State Board of Cosmetology, which affirmed individual orders by a hearing examiner that the shop owners had violated Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the shop owners argued that the Pennsylvania Beauty Culture Law did not apply to hair braiding, that the definition of cosmetology did not include the work performed by the shop owners, and that the application of the Law violated the shop owners' right to equal protection and substantive due process under the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. The appellate court concluded that the Board did not err in concluding that hair braiding was encompassed in the definition of cosmetology as set forth in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 507 because braiding and adding extensions to hair qualified as embellishment, beautification, dressing or arranging of hair. In addition, the services provided by the shop owners met the definition of cosmetology. Also, the shop owners did not meet their burden in establishing that the Law was unconstitutional in its application because it was impossible for the appellate court to determine whether or not cosmetology schools provided curriculum rationally related to the shop owners' profession where none of the shop owners provided any testimony regarding the nature of their businesses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, appealed the order of the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania) that found that appellee driver was not required to comply with the Pennsylvania Ignition Interlock Law, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7001 et seq. The appellate court initially affirmed. It subsequently granted the Department's application for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the driver's second drunk driving conviction, the Department notified the driver that he was required to have all vehicles owned by him equipped with an ignition interlock system in order for his operating privileges to be restored at the end of his one-year license suspension. Pursuant to Pennsylvania caselaw, the Department was not permitted to require the driver to install the device in all of his vehicles. The driver asserted that, irrespective of the Department's authority, his plea bargain stated that he would not be subject to ignition interlock requirements. The trial court and district attorney in the driver's criminal case lacked the authority to approve the plea bargain with such a provision. Finally, the driver argued that the Department was prohibited from considering his acceptance of accelerated rehabilitative disposition as a conviction for the purposes of the Pennsylvania Ignition Interlock Law, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7001 et seq. The issue was unpreserved, as the trial court did not address whether the Department's imposition of the Law was impermissibly retroactive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed insofar as the driver was restricted to an ignition interlock restricted license as a condition of the restoration of his operating privilege following his service of the one-year suspension.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant institution challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County (Pennsylvania), which denied its request to extend a charitable real estate tax exemption to a parcel of property on which its independent living section was located.

Ann. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 371-385, which provided that an institution was entitled to a presumption under the Act that it was an institution of purely public charity and the parcel consisting of the independent living apartments was exempt from real estate taxes as a purely public charity. The trial court, and the court, agreed that the institution was entitled to the rebuttable presumption under the Act, but that the institution was still not entitled to the exemption because there was no evidence that it was donating a substantial portion of its services to the residents living in the independent living apartments. As a result, the institution did not meet the definition of a purely public charity. The court noted that it did not matter that the facilities were all located on the same property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a judge representing the judges of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania) (judges), sought review of an arbitration award in a contract dispute between the judges and a bargaining unit of court-appointed professional employees. The judges sought to have a clause that required mandatory, non-binding arbitration of non-economic matters for members of the bargaining unit stricken from the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent county commissioners bargained on behalf of the judges with regard to the collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The judges objected to the inclusion of any clause requiring mandatory arbitration on non-economic matters in the CBA because such a procedure would violate the statutory and constitutional authority of the courts to hire, supervise, discipline and discharge personnel they appointed. The issue went to arbitration and resulted in an arbitration award that mandated advisory arbitration of non-economic matters for members of the bargaining unit. The court struck the clause. While Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 1620 vested the commissioners with exclusive bargaining authority, that authority did not diminish the right of courts to hire, supervise and discharge their employees, and no collective bargaining agreement could interfere with the judges' authority to do so. The fact that the arbitration clause in question was merely advisory did not negate the fact that the procedure interfered with the judges' inherent authority by inquiry into their decision making process. As the clause violated both statutory and prior case law, it was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suspension and fine were imposed after the salesman pleaded guilty to insurance fraud. Reinstatement could be made only after a showing that the salesman was sufficiently remorseful and had become sufficiently rehabilitated to justify reinstatement. That restriction was based on responses the salesman made to questions posed during his disciplinary hearing where he did not admit guilt but indicated he pleaded guilty because he wanted to avoid a lengthy prison sentence and because he wanted to avoid the expenses associated with trial. The salesman's appeal concerned the length of the suspension and the requirements for reinstatement. The court affirmed the Board's decision, holding that (1) the Board had authority under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 818.21 to either revoke or suspend a license and the authority to revoke included the lesser power to suspend the license indefinitely for at least six months; (2) there was no statutory limit on conditions for reinstatement and the requirement for credible proof of remorse and rehabilitation was reasonable; and (3) the conditions for reinstatement were within the Board's authority and were not impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner parents petitioned the Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement System (SERS) to change the beneficiary on their deceased son's account. The SERS directed that his death benefit be paid to his last named beneficiary, his former wife. The parents appealed. Respondent Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement Board denied the request and directed that the decedent's death benefit be paid to his former wife. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before his death, the decedent was employed by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and was a member of the SERS. When he got married, the decedent designated his then wife to be his beneficiary. Later, the decedent and his wife divorced. After his divorce, the decedent named his parents as his will beneficiaries and transferred property to them. His parents provided him with care and support for his alcoholism. The decedent's ex-wife did not visit or support him. The last nomination of beneficiary form in the decedent's SERS file designated his ex-wife as principal beneficiary of his SERS retirement account. The parents claimed that 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6111.2 applied, and that the parents should therefore by operation of law be the beneficiary of the SERS retirement account. The court found that applying 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6111.2 retroactively to the matter would impair constitutionally protected contractual rights. Notwithstanding the possible inequity of the result, the only writing in evidence was the beneficiary nomination form designating the decedent's former wife as the beneficiary of his retirement benefits. Therefore, the Board's decision was proper.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers' complaint, which was filed in equity, challenged the constitutionality of the county's property assessment under the Uniformity Clause, Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, and sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers asserted that the county had failed to follow a standard adopted by it in its Assessment Standards and Practices Ordinance and that the assessment was not uniform. Affirming the trial court's decision, the court held that (1) the trial court did not have equity jurisdiction over the taxpayers' Uniformity Clause challenge because, even if it assumed that the taxpayers raised a substantial constitutional question and established a discriminatory effect, they failed to establish that no adequate legal remedy existed where they had not alleged that the Board of Assessment Appeals could not re-evaluate the total millage in an assessment appeal and where the statutory remedy could accommodate a multitude of tax assessment issues; (2) because Pennsylvania's administrative process for challenging tax assessments provided the taxpayers with an adequate state remedy, the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to consider the taxpayers' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action; and (3) the taxpayers claims that the county failed to comply with standards imposed by ordinance presented a question of law and could be addressed in an appeal to the Board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, whose business adjoined the property where defendant kept his dog, was walking on the rear section of her property when she heard rustling behind her. The victim turned to see defendant's dog just as it lunged at her and bit her leg. The dog knocked the victim to the ground and inflicted four puncture wounds. There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of harboring a dangerous dog in violation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 459-502-A. The evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the dog attacked the victim without provocation pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 459-502-A(a)(1)(iii), thereby demonstrating a propensity to attack human beings without provocation pursuant to Pa. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant utility company sought review from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Pike County (Pennsylvania), which ordered the company to pay additional penalties and interest to appellee county boards of assessment and revision of taxes, based on the utility's original unpaid tax bills for a particular hydroelectric generating station, rather than on the final tax bills.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The station was located in two counties, which were governed by the Fourth to Eighth Class County Assessment Law (FECCAL), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 5453.101 to -.706, as well as the General County Assessment Law (GCAL), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 5020-1 to -602. The company appealed the assessments in each county, which resulted in increased collective assessments and a fair market value that was approximately 41 times greater than the combined fair market value prior to the appeal. During the pendency of the company's appeals, which were consolidated to one court, the company failed to pay additional taxes due. The question before the court was which assessment the penalties and costs were to be based on. The court used principles of statutory construction to determine that the trial court erred in determining that those amounts were to be based on the face amount of the unpaid tax bills. Such an interpretation would have resulted in different treatment, based on the differing procedure in &sect; 17 of the Second Class County Assessment Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 5452.1 to -.20, specifically at Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5452.17. It would have also led to an unreasonable result.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the matter for calculation of the penalties and interest owed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and several of its officers and officials, filed preliminary objections to petitioner's request for review, in the nature of an action in mandamus and bill of equity. The petition challenged the constitutionality of Act 77 of the Second Class County Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect;&sect; 6101-B to 6173-B, which created the Allegheny Regional Asset District (RAD).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">RAD was an independent, special purpose unit of local government covering the geographic region of Allegheny County, and Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 6152-B authorized Allegheny County to levy a sales and use tax to carry out the purposes of RAD. Sustaining the Commonwealth's objections, the court held that (1) the allegations of the petition did not support a claim that Act 77 violated Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 by precluding citizens from challenging RAD through the agenda initiative and voter referendum process; (2) petitioner's allegations that amending the bill four times, adding 13 lines to its title, and adding 29 pages to its text were insufficient to warrant an inquiry by the court into the manner in which Act 77 was enacted under Pa. Const. art. III. &sect;&sect; 1 and 3; (3) Act 77 did not authorize RAD to levy taxes, but, rather, the exclusive power to levy the RAD tax was vested in Allegheny County, pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 6152-B(a); accordingly, there was no violation of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 31; and (4) the allegations failed to support a conclusion that any classification of taxpayers subject to the RAD tax was unreasonable under Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

The Ignition Interlock Law, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7001-7003, after Mockaitis, did not require the installation of an ignition interlock device on a specific vehicle. It required the recidivist driving while intoxicated licensee to obtain a restricted license from the Bureau as a condition precedent to restoration of driving privileges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee driver challenged appellant Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing's order that he install ignition interlock devices on his vehicles before his operating privileges were restored after a one-year court imposed suspension. The Common Pleas Court of the County of Chester (Pennsylvania) upheld the suspension, but sustained the driver's appeal of the ignition interlock requirement. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's license was suspended as a result of his conviction for driving under the influence (DUI). The driver was convicted of DUI on three prior occasions. The court ordered the mandatory one-year suspension of the driver's operating privileges but did not order the installation of an ignition interlock system. By notice mailed to the driver, the Department notified the driver that his operating privileges were suspended and that in order to restore the privileges he would have to equip each of his vehicles with an ignition interlock system or remain ineligible for restoration for an additional one-year period. On appeal, the court found that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had invalidated the 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7002(b) (current version at 75 Pa. Const. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3805) requirement that the trial court order installation of an ignition interlock system on each vehicle owned by the person to be effective upon the restoration of operating privileges. No other provision was in effect at the time of the driver's conviction and notice of suspension that would authorize the Department to act independently to order the installation of an ignition interlock system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed to the extent that it sustained the driver's appeal from the Department's notice that he was required to obtain an ignition interlock restricted license if he sought reinstatement of his operating privilege after the expiration of the suspension of his operating privilege. The order was affirmed to the extent that it sustained the driver's appeal from notice of a requirement that he install ignition interlock systems.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the order, and the agency sought reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee pled guilty to a third offense of driving under the influence. Upon accepting the plea, the trial court did not require the licensee to install an ignition interlock system pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7002(b). The agency suspended the licensee's operating privilege as a consequence of his conviction and informed him that he was required to equip all vehicles owned by him with an ignition interlock system in order for his operating privilege to be restored at the end of that period. On appeal from the suspension notice, the trial court upheld the suspension but relieved the licensee from the requirement that he equip his vehicles with ignition interlock systems as a prerequisite to restoration of his driving privilege. The court found that the trial court had jurisdiction under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 933(a)(1)(ii), 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1550(a) to hear matters relating to the suspension of operating privileges. Although the agency had authority under 42 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant filed a claim alleging that she sustained a work-related injury. A workers' compensation judge (WCJ) found that the claimant sustained a work-related injury and awarded her total disability benefits for one period of time and partial disability benefits thereafter. The Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Appeal Board affirmed the decision. The claimant filed a petition for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant contended that the WCJ and the Board erred in calculating her average weekly wage (AWW) under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 582(d) and, alternatively, that &sect; 582 violated her right to equal protection of the laws under both the Pennsylvania and the United States Constitutions. More specifically, she asserted that her AWW was artificially low because she missed a substantial amount of work during the four consecutive 13-week periods due to maternity leave. She also argued that &sect; 582(d) diminished her right to workers' compensation benefits based solely on her gender. On appeal, the court found that the claimant was continuously employed during the period of her maternity leave for purposes of calculating her AWW under &sect; 582(d). Consequently, because she was continuously employed by her employer for the four 13-calendar-week periods immediately preceding her work injury, the WCJ and the Board did not err in calculating her AWW under &sect; 582(d). Further, &sect; 582 did not violate the claimant's right to equal protection of the law under either the United States or Pennsylvania Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner county employer appealed the order of respondent State Civil Service Commission (Pennsylvania), which granted respondent employee's challenge to his removal as a caseworker because of a 1980 conviction for aggravated assault in violation of the Child Protective Services Law, 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 6301-6385.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the employer argued that the Commission erred in finding that 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6344(c) violated Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and in concluding that the employer failed to present evidence establishing just cause for the removal of the employee. The appellate court found that 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6344(c) prohibited the hiring of applicants previously convicted of certain enumerated crimes; however, it did not ban existing employees from continuing to work in the child-care field, despite having a similar conviction. Because 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6344(c), as it related to aggravated assault, created limitations that had no temporal proximity to the time of hiring, it did not bear a real and substantial relationship to the Commonwealth's interest in protecting children and was unconstitutional. In addition, the employer failed to present any evidence establishing just cause for the employee's removal. The employer admitted that but for 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6344, the employee would not have been removed from his position, as his work was exemplary--demonstrating that his remote conviction did not reflect upon his present abilities to perform the duties of a caseworker.</SPAN></P>

The stipulation established the number of greenhouses that could be placed on the owner's property. The Board's conditional approval of the application included the conditions, which were taken from the stipulation. The applicant appealed, and the owner intervened. Because of the appeal, the Board's letter responding to the application was deemed a denial. The trial court upheld all but two of the conditions. The court affirmed, holding that (1) the denial letter, which incorporated the stipulation, satisfied the requirements of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 10508(2); (2) the stipulation had the force and effect of law and was properly considered by the Board; (3) the owner was not denied due process simply because he did not foresee all of the ramifications of the stipulation; (4) the trial court properly refused to hear additional evidence; and (5) the conditions imposed by the Board did not constitute spot zoning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, sheriffs, deputy sheriffs, and the district attorneys of four counties, filed a petition for review in the nature of a complaint in equity against respondent, the Commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police. The Commissioner had ruled that sheriffs and their deputies were not investigative or law enforcement officers entitled to certain wiretap training.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five of the deputies had applied for wiretap investigation training pursuant to the requirements of the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act (Wiretap Act), 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5701-5781. The applications were rejected based on the Commissioner's determination that under the Wiretap Act, the deputies were not eligible for the training. The court agreed. At common law, sheriffs possessed broad powers, but the authority to conduct wiretap investigations was statutory in nature and did not extend to those common law powers. Sheriffs in Pennsylvania had only limited law enforcement functions. Their main functions were court-related, although the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had recognized limited law enforcement functions, such as effectuating warrantless arrests for offense committed in their presence. Neither the sheriffs, nor their deputies had the power or right to investigate any of the predicate offenses for obtaining a wiretap order. Therefore, they could not be considered investigative or law enforcement officers under the Wiretap Act, and they were ineligible for the wiretap training offered by the State Police.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, appealed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County (Pennsylvania), which sustained the appeal of appellee licensee from the requirement that he install ignition interlock devices on all vehicles that he owned before his operating privilege could be restored. The trial court allowed the appeal nunc pro tunc.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee pled guilty to driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol. This was the licensee's second DUI conviction. Neither the Commonwealth nor the licensee appealed the judgment of sentence. Thereafter, the Department notified the licensee that his operating privilege was suspended for one year and that prior to the restoration of his operating privilege he would need to have ignition interlock devices installed on his vehicles. The licensee did not take an appeal from this suspension notice within the statutory period. On appeal, the Department argued that the trial court erred when it allowed the licensee to appeal nunc pro tunc. The appellate court found that the restoration of driving privileges, i.e., whether and when repeat DUI offenders were entitled to conditional restoration of their operating privileges, was not a function of the court, but rather the unique authority and responsibility of the Department. Because there was no contention by the licensee that other circumstances warranted allowance of a nunc pro tunc appeal, the licensee failed to timely challenge the Department's imposition of the ignition interlock requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court was vacated and remanded with instructions to quash the licensee's statutory appeal as untimely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Council adopted three resolutions regarding an operating budget, a capital budget, and a grants, special accounts, and agency fund budget. The CE exercised his power under 302 Pa. Code &sect; 1.7-705 by vetoing certain items in all three budget resolutions. Specifically, he used his veto power to reduce allocations to certain items--a reduction veto. On appeal, the CE raised several issues. The appellate court concluded that the language in the Home Rule Charter was clear and plain. The CE could exercise a line-item veto, but not a reduction line-item veto. Thus, the Charter granted to the CE only the power to strike certain items entirely, and not the power to reduce the amounts appropriated for individual line items in a budget resolution. In addition, the CE's attempt to exercise a power that the Charter did not grant to him resulted in a nullity of the vetoes he sought to effectuate by reduction. Also, the Charter gave the CE the power to veto only items in the annual operating and capital budgets. The trial court did not err in concluding that the CE's vetoes were improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case involving a business privilege tax, appellant corporation appealed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), which denied its motion for summary judgment and determined that appellee city was entitled to tax all of the corporation's gross receipts. The common pleas court authorized an immediate appeal of the interlocutory order. The appellate court granted the corporation permission to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation operated a trash hauling business. It maintained an office within the city and conducted its business both inside and outside of the city. The city enacted a business privilege tax on the gross volume of business transacted within the &quot;territorial limits&quot; of the city. On appeal, the corporation argued that the common pleas court committed an error of law when it denied the corporation's motion for summary judgment because the language of City of Chester, Pa., Tax Ordinance &sect; 307.02 did not authorize the city to seek back taxes, penalties, and interest from the corporation on receipts from the gross volume of business transacted outside the city. The appellate court concluded that the language of the ordinance at issue was different from the code scrutinized in the Gilberti case. The common pleas court did not address the difference between the ordinance and the code when it denied the corporation's motion for summary judgment on the basis of Gilberti. Thus, under the city ordinance, the corporation was not liable for the business privilege tax of the city for the years in question on gross receipts earned outside the territorial limits of the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing (PennDOT), appealed a judgment by the Common Pleas Court of the County of Delaware (Pennsylvania), which sustained appellee licensee's appeal of PennDOT's requirement that ignition interlock devices be installed on his vehicles before it would restore his driving privilege.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the licensee was convicted of three separate incidents of driving under the influence of alcohol, the PennDOT sent him a series of letters suspending his driving privilege and requiring the installation of ignition interlock devices on all vehicles that the licensee owned before his license would be restored. The licensee claimed that the PennDOT lacked independent authority to require installation of ignition interlock devices without a court order. The appellate court held that, pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7002(3), the only authority that the PennDOT had was to issue interlock restricted licenses. Nowhere did the remaining Ignition Interlock Device Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7001-7003, grant the PennDOT the independent authority to require installation of interlock devices. As a result, the trial court properly sustained the licensee's appeal.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the rejection of the landowner's claim, the court held that: (1) the landowner's appeal was not subject to dismissal merely because its Pa. R. App. P. 1925(b) statement addressed numerous issues; (2) a car dealership fell within the plain meaning of the term &quot;retail store,&quot; and thus the landowner did not meet its heavy burden of proving the ordinance was unlawfully exclusionary; (3) the ordinance was not de facto exclusionary because the permanent outdoor merchandise storage limitation and the prohibition on front year display did not effectively prohibit car dealership use; (4) pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53 &sect; 10908(6), evidence that the landowner contended should have been admitted at the hearing was irrelevant and, therefore, properly excluded; and (5) the landowner did not establish grounds for disqualification because, after examining each supervisor regarding potential bias, the landowner failed to produce evidence to show the supervisors exhibited bias in their conduct during the hearings in the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, a commonwealth and its department of environmental protection, and intervenor waste industry association filed preliminary objections in the state's highest court (Pennsylvania) to an amended petition filed by petitioners, various local governmental entities and their residents, alleging that portions of the Pennsylvania Environmental Resources Code (Chapter 63), specifically 27 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 6301-6306, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners argued that the initiation of disposal fees under Chapter 63 violated their due process rights. The appellate court held that as petitioners challenged legislative, rather than official action, their procedural due process claim failed. Chapter 63 was not overruled under the doctrine of stare decisis as petitioners passed the fee on to the waste generators. Previous caselaw was not controlling, as petitioners did not aver an inability to pass the disposal fee on to the generators of the waste. The $ 0.50 per month increase in the monthly fee paid by the individual petitioners did not constitute a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship. Assuming that the surcharge was a substantial impairment of constitutional significance, petitioners still would not prevail, as the impairment was outweighed by the necessity of the regulation and the benefits to the public good. To the extent the surcharge could be deemed an impairment, it was nominal, leaving the hurdle to be cleared by Chapter 63 low. Petitioners did not plead facts to show that the disposal fee was not imposed uniformly. Finally, Chapter 63 was clear and not in the least vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant argued that the treatment of her self-employment earnings differently than the earnings of a claimant who was concurrently employed violated her equal protection rights. The appellate court held that &sect; 309(e) of the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act, 1915 Pa. Laws 736, as amended, specifically Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 582(e), did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. As a self-employed individual was neither an employee nor an employer under the Act and was not required to participate in the workers' compensation system, it would be inequitable to require an employer to include self-employment earnings in a claimant's wage loss benefits. Thus, the classification relating to self-employed claimants was rationally related to the state's legitimate goal of balancing the interests of employees and employers under the workers' compensation system. Moreover, the government had a legitimate interest in excluding self-employment earnings from concurrent employment wage calculations to ensure that employers were only required to pay benefits for verifiable wages and reliably-reported income.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Philadelphia Parking Authority (PPA) filed preliminary objections challenging a suit filed by appellee City of Philadelphia seeking monetary damages and specific performance for breaches of two contracts, after the Common Pleas Court (Pennsylvania) transferred the suit to the appellate court, holding that the appellate court had exclusive original jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City argued that the suit was not within the appellate court's original jurisdiction. The appellate court held that the PPA was a local agency for jurisdiction purposes. What made an authority a local agency was not who appointed the board members, but who created the authority. Despite the fact that Pennsylvania Act 22, 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5501 et seq., changed who appointed board members to the PPA, the Act did not change the fact that the City created the PPA or that in first class cities, only the city could create a parking authority. Section 5504(1) (53 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5504(1)) provided that a parking authority was created if a legislative body desired to organize such an authority, and it adopted a resolution or ordinance signifying intention to do so. &quot;Legislative body&quot; was defined as the council of a city or borough and the board of commissioners of a first class township. Because the PPA was created by the City, it was, by definition, a local authority. Because the PPA was a local authority and not part of the &quot;commonwealth government,&quot; and because prior caselaw remained controlling, the suit did not fall within the appellate court's original jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants, the mayor of Reading, Pennsylvania, and its managing director, appealed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, Pennsylvania, that granted the complaint in declaratory judgment filed by plaintiff City Council. The appeal concerned whether the City Council had certain authority regarding two staff positions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate issues were (1) whether the Mayor and Managing Director alone possessed administrative and executive authority over Reading's merit personnel system, (2) whether the Home Rule Charter for The City of Reading, Pennsylvania authorized City Council to appoint only the City Clerk, (3) whether the employment authority of the Mayor and Managing Director was confined to the &quot;Administrative Service&quot; or &quot;Administrative Branch,&quot; and (4) whether the separation of powers doctrine required that City Council had power to hire and fire for the positions of City Council Chief of Staff and City Council Legislative Coordinator. The court concluded that the Managing Director's suspension and removal powers as described in &sect; 406(c) of the Charter would apply to these two positions. Second, the City Council lacked power over the two newly created positions. Third, the Mayor and Managing Director had personnel responsibilities for all non-exempt career service employees in the City's government. Finally, in Pennsylvania, because the State Constitution did not dictate the separation of powers at the local government level, there was no Constitutional separation of powers at that level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner retired teachers filed a petition for review asserting a class action for a judgment declaring unconstitutional amendments to the Public School Employees' Retirement Code, 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8101-8535, and the State Employees' Retirement Code, 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5101-5956.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">2001 Pa. Laws 9 amended both the Public School and State Employees' Retirement Codes to allow current employees to increase the amount of their contributions and receive an increased amount upon retirement. Upon election to the new class, the employees' prior service was credited under the new membership class. Members of either system who retired before the effective date of the Act were not eligible to elect a new class of membership. The teachers argued that the amendments violated equal protection under the Pennsylvania and U.S. Constitutions. The court held that the rational basis test was the correct standard for the equal protection inquiry under both constitutions, since the legislation at issue burdened neither a fundamental right nor a suspect class, and the fact that the legislators amended the retirement system in which they participated provided no basis for heightened judicial scrutiny. The legislation did not violate equal protection, as limiting participation in new service classes to members actively employed and contributing was a rational means to achieve valid legislative objectives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of an order of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Greene (Pennsylvania), which sustained the preliminary objections of appellees, prison officials and guards, and dismissed the inmate's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The complaint alleged violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and due process rights, libel, and civil conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed grievances regarding his placement in a restricted housing unit. Subsequently, he was found guilty of two misconduct charges and was transferred to a long-term segregation unit (LTSU). The inmate sued, claiming that he had been retaliated against for filing the grievances. The trial court dismissed the case. On appeal, the court held that the inmate had stated a claim for retaliation because the claim was made under U.S. Const. amend. I and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 26, and not 37 Pa. Code &sect; 93.9, which created no private remedy. The inmate's due process claims, which related to the retaliation and the disciplinary hearing's procedure, were properly dismissed because his confinement in a LTSU did not impose an atypical and significant hardship on him in relation to ordinary prison life, and thus, no liberty interest was triggered. The libel claim was properly dismissed because even if sufficiently pleaded, it did not fall within any of the exceptions to immunity and could not be maintained under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8522(b). Finally, the conspiracy claim was properly dismissed because the inmate failed to plead sufficient facts or the necessary predicate illegal act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portions of the trial court's order that sustained the preliminary objections to the due process, libel, and conspiracy claims. The court reversed the portion of the trial court's order that sustained the objection to the inmate's retaliation claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant appealed from an adjudication of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (Pennsylvania), which denied her claim for unemployment benefits, affirming the referee's determination that she was ineligible for benefits due to her employment by her son pursuant to Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant worked part-time for a law firm that was wholly owned by her son until such time as she was terminated. At that time, she sought unemployment benefits, which were denied to her based on her ineligibility under &sect; 753(l)(4)(5). The Board affirmed the decision of the referee, and the claimant sought judicial review. The claimant sought to overturn prior case law that held that the classification contained in &sect; 753(l)(4)(5) was constitutional. The court initially noted that because family relationships were not suspect classifications, the rational relationship test of U.S. Const. amend. XIV was applicable to the claimant's equal protection challenge. However, the court found that such case law was valid, in that the classification was rationally related to an important state interest of avoiding potential fraud among family members. The court found that the claimant had not met her burden of proving that the classification scheme was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner objector filed a petition to set aside the nomination petition of respondent candidate, who was listed as a minor party candidate in a municipal election for the office of common pleas court judge, based on his having unsuccessfully run as a candidate in the primary elections of the major political parties previously, in violation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 25, &sect;&sect; 2911(e)(5), 2936.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate was cross-filed on the Republican and Democratic ballots for a judgeship position, but was defeated on both tickets in those parties' primary elections. Thereafter, the Reform party asked him to become their candidate. He obtained the requisite signatures and completed a candidate's affidavit. The objector filed her petition to set aside the candidate's nomination petition, alleging that because he ran on the other two ballots in the May, 2003 primary, he was forbidden from being the minor party's candidate in the November, 2003 general election. The court initially reviewed case law from other ballot access cases and determined that an intermediate level of scrutiny was applicable under the equal protection challenge of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 25, &sect;&sect; 2911(e)(5), 2936 were constitutional, in that the importance of the state's interest in foreclosing the nomination of &quot;sore losers&quot; justified the burden imposed on minor political parties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections moved for summary judgment in petitioner inmate's suit for a declaratory judgment that the Department's legal fees policy was unlawfully deprived him of access to the courts. The inmate also challenged the withholding his &quot;idle pay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department's policy limited to $ 10 a month the amount that the Department would place in an inmate account for legal mailings. The issue was whether the policy violated the inmate's access to the courts under federal law. The Department's stated reason for the policy was that it allowed it to continue to provide inmates with access to the courts, while taking into consideration: (1) the need for consistent application of the policy and practices throughout the state's correctional institutions; and (2) the Department's fiscal responsibility to the taxpayers. The court found that the evidence established a rational connection between the regulation and a legitimate neutral governmental interest. It permitted court access, limited the funds advanced equally for each indigent inmate, and held a line on taxpayer monies employed for that purpose. Moreover, the Department persuasively argued that because the money was coming from its own budget, it had to curtail the amounts available for other important programs. The policy passed constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court cost clerk sent a financial obligation form to the Department of Corrections seeking payment from the prisoner's inmate account pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9728(b)(5), commonly referred to as Act 84. The money was to be used to pay costs, fines, and restitution ordered as part of the prisoner's sentences, all of which were at least several years old. The prisoner sought to have the costs, fines, and restitution quashed because he fully served the confinement and supervision portions of his remote sentences before the Act 84 deductions were taken. The appellate court held that what the prisoner actually sought was a modification of his sentences to remove payment of costs, fines, and restitution. The prisoner filed his papers in the instant matter seven years after the last sentence at issue was entered. Seven years was well past the allowed periods for seeking modification of costs and fines. The prisoner also argued that he was entitled to reimbursement of money deducted from his inmate account prior to the trial court's order to stop the deductions. The appellate court found that Act 84 clearly authorized the deductions taken, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9728(b)(5).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a hospital trade association and three non-profit hospitals, sought to enjoin certain provisions of the General Appropriations Act of 2002 (the 2002 GAA) S.5, 186th Gen. Assem., Reg. Sess. (Pa. 2002), which it claimed improperly changed the substantive law on reimbursement to providers who treated Medical Assistance (MA) recipients. Respondents, the Department of Public Welfare (DPW) and its Secretary, moved to dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 40, &sect; 991.2116 (Act 68), guaranteed a managed care organization (MCO) &quot;reasonably necessary costs.&quot; Petitioners argued that the 2002 GAA, which capped the DPW's fee-for-service rate when a provider was not under contract with the MCO in which a MA recipient was enrolled, conflicted with Act 68 and violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 11. The court rejected petitioners' claims. Petitioners had standing to maintain their action because they sought to protect a substantial interest, namely, the right of a hospital to negotiate with a MCO for payment of emergency services provided to MA recipients. The court agreed with respondents, however, that the disputed provision in the 2002 GAA was not a rate-setting statute and thus did not effect a change in the substantive law. A general appropriations bill could include limitations on the expenditure of funds, and the disputed provision limited the amount of public funds that could be used to reimburse noncontracting service providers. The provision did not conflict with Act 68, pursuant to which DPW had to pay for the &quot;reasonably necessary costs&quot; of inpatient care; those costs were specified in DPW's fee-for-service schedule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained DPW's preliminary objections, except its challenge to petitioners' standing, and the court dismissed petitioners' request for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the bar raised several issues. The appellate court found that the Commonwealth's prohibition of topless dancing in establishments that served alcohol did not violate the freedom of expression guaranteed by Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7. The Liquor Control Board (LCB) issued licenses to dispense alcohol on the condition that the license holder not permit lewd, immoral or improper entertainment. The LCB had the authority to impose this condition and topless dancing performed in licensed establishments could be lewd, immoral or improper entertainment per se. In addition, the creation of appellee Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement by the legislature's 1987 revision to the Liquor Code did not deny due process to the bar because the operators of the bar acted with full knowledge that the behavior they allowed on their premises, and which the police officers observed, was lewd, immoral or improper behavior as a matter of law. Finally, the appellate court concluded that there was sufficient, competent evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that the behavior about which the officers testified constituted a violation of Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant adult entertainment facility (AEF) owner sought review of a judgment of the Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, Court of Common Pleas, which affirmed the decision of the Pulaski Township Board of Supervisors (Board) denying applications AEF owner and employee licenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township enacted an ordinance, which, inter alia, required the licensing of employees and operators of sexually oriented businesses. Existing adult businesses were given a 180-day grace period to apply for a license. Because the owner's business fell within the grace period. The owner did not apply for a license. Following the elapse of the grace period, township officials filed an injunction to preclude continued operations. In response, the owner challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. The appellate court did not find the provisions of the ordinance to be content-based. The findings section of the ordinance clearly noted that its primary purpose was to address the secondary effects arising from the operation of an AEF business. Several of the legislative findings raised concerns relating to hours of operation of the facility. The appellate court held that the limitation of hours was no greater than was necessary to accomplish legitimate governmental goals. As an AEF in operation at the time of the ordinance's enactment, the business had ample opportunity to pursue declaratory relief to determine the constitutionality of the ordinance. It did not do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner, in her capacity as the rehabilitator of two insurers, filed petitions seeking the liquidation of respondent insurers on the grounds that the insurers consented to the liquidation, they were insolvent, further rehabilitation was futile and could increase the risk of loss to creditors and others, and there was a need to trigger state guaranty funds. Various parties intervened.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurers were basically fronting companies that issued insurance policies that were largely reinsured by other insurers. Various parties, including the controlling shareholder of both insurers and various policyholders, were granted intervention in the action to state their position with respect to the potential liquidation. The positions were assorted, but many opposed the relief requested by the rehabilitator, noting that it would create hardship for their own clients, that they would prefer direct access to the reinsurance, that the state guaranty funds would be inadequate, and that rehabilitation was feasible. After careful consideration by the court of all parties' positions, it held that the rehabilitator had no authority to purportedly consent on the insurers' behalf to the liquidation, pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 40, &sect; 221.18(a). The court found that liquidation was inevitable because rehabilitation would substantially increase the risk of loss, but that allowing direct access to the reinsurers was mandated in order to protect policyholder interests. It was noted that the policyholders had established third-party beneficiary rights under the reinsurance agreements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the rehabilitator's petition to terminate the rehabilitation, and granted direct access to the reinsurance agreements to those intervenors which demonstrated third-party beneficiary status. The court directed the rehabilitator to draft plans as to the direct access, as well as to the liquidation of the insurer, which was also granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County (Pennsylvania), which found him guilty of violating City of Pottsville, Pa., Ordinance &sect; 176 and directed that he pay fines and restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that (1) the ordinance, which he asserted criminalized a landlord's refusal to permit warrantless entry, was unconstitutional; (2) the fee charged for inspections was actually an invalid tax; and (3) the ordinance violated equal protection. The main issue was whether defendant could be criminally convicted for refusing to allow a code enforcement inspector access to the residential apartments he owned and leased in the absence of a search warrant. The city argued that a warrant was not required because the search involved an industry that was &quot;pervasively&quot; regulated. The appellate court concluded that an administrative warrant had to be obtained prior to convicting an owner for failing to permit access to conduct inspections under the ordinance. Because no warrant was issued, defendant's conviction violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable warrantless searches. However, defendant failed to show an unconstitutional tax because there was no evidence that the fee was for revenue-raising purposes, rather than to defer administrative enforcement costs. Also, there was a rational basis for the inspection of leased residential premises.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An off-duty police officer in an unmarked car noticed a car behind him swerving and driving erratically. The officer put a red light on his car and pulled over the licensee's vehicle, at which time he identified himself as an officer. The officer testified that the driver appeared intoxicated and he failed a field sobriety test, and accordingly, the officer arrested the licensee and transported him to the hospital for a blood test. However, the licensee refused the test, despite having been informed of the consequences of such refusal. The Department sent the licensee a notice that his operating privileges were being suspended for one year, pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1546(b)(1), for his refusal to submit to the testing. The licensee's appeal resulted in a hearing, whereupon the trial court determined that the suspension was proper because the officer had reasonable grounds to suspect that the licensee was operating the vehicle in an intoxicated state. The licensee sought further review and the court held that the validity of the arrest was irrelevant for determining whether suspension was proper for the licensee's refusal to submit to a chemical test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Commonwealth, filed preliminary objections to a complaint filed by petitioners, a trial lawyers association and an attorney, seeking a declaration that 2002 Pa. Laws 127 (Act 127), relating in part to venue in medical professional liability actions, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents argued that the association lacked standing to bring the suit and that petitioners failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court concluded that petitioners had standing to maintain the action because the petition for review alleged that a number of the association's members were members in good standing of the bar of Pennsylvania who engaged in medical malpractice litigation and who would be directly and substantially affected by the changes in the venue rules contained in Act 127 and whose clients would be directly and substantially affected. In addition, the court agreed with petitioners that venue in civil cases concerned a matter of pure procedure. In the absence of a countervailing constitutional provision authorizing the legislature to act in regard to venue in a particular area, the matter was committed to the exclusive authority of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court under Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 10(c). Thus, the court concluded that Act 127, insofar as it purported to alter the rules relating to venue in regard to medical professional liability actions generally, exceeded the authority of the legislature and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The preliminary objection of respondents raising a question of standing was overruled. The preliminary objections of respondents asserting failure to state a cause of action under the constitutional provision relating to the passage of laws were sustained. The preliminary objection of respondents asserting failure to state cause of action under the constitutional rules regarding venue was overruled.</SPAN></P>

Laws 90, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth argued that the Pennsylvania Municipalities Authorities Act, 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. 5601 et seq., did not apply to a disposal fee on municipal waste. The appellate court held that insofar as the acceptance and proper disposal of waste enhanced the health and living conditions of Pennsylvania citizens, the authorities stated a claim for statutory tax exemption for things used in that function. Pennsylvania law was clear that property acquired or used by an authority did not lose its tax exemption unless a statute clearly and unequivocally expressed the legislative will that such property was not immune. For the purpose of resolving the preliminary objections, the authorities stated a claim for statutory exemption from taxation on things used by them to improve the living conditions of Pennsylvania citizens. Respondents failed to show a clear intent on the part of the legislature to overcome the statutory exemption. The authorities claim that the fee violated their state and federal constitution rights to unimpaired contracts stated a claim, as they alleged that the fee could not be passed on to all of their customers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The psychologist argued that the Board failed to provide proper notice of its interpretation of the American Psychological Association (APA) Guidelines. The appellate court found that although the APA ethical rules were framed as aspirations, they had been made mandatory by their inclusion in the Board's requirements for licensees. The Board properly held that the psychologist had violated the father's right to participate in major decisions as to his child by evaluating her without the father's consent and in continuing contact after being told to stop. The psychologist's argument that his conduct fell under the child abuse exception to the rule was rejected. The exclusion of a former Board member's testimony was proper, as previous Board policy was irrelevant. The Board's decision that the psychologist performed a custody evaluation was supported by the evidence. The psychologist's argument that the father's consent was not required because he was a litigant was rejected. However, the Board's determination that the psychologist acted unprofessionally was reversed, as the psychologist did not receive adequate notice that his testimony in the custody hearing was at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Allegheny Valley School District appealed the order of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania) holding that appellee Allegheny County Board of Property Assessment, Appeals, and Review and Registry properly increased an assessment of appellee owner's property to include a value for a trailer added to the land, but it reversed the Board's assessment of the land underlying the trailer as an improper spot assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The unimproved land at issue was leased by the owner to the tenant. The tenant moved a trailer onto the property. The county assessor learned of the existence of the trailer on the property in 1995 and that it had been on the property since at least 1991. The assessor increased the 1996 assessment of the land from $ 2,400 to $ 61,500. The assessor used a market value approach, relying upon the sale of land across the street from the owner's property to determine the value of the owner's land. The assessor then assessed the trailer on the property, which was found to be $ 5,000. The assessment of the property for 1991 through 1995 was retroactively increased. The owner asserted that the reassessment of land from 1991 through 1996 constituted an impermissible spot assessment. The assessor's actions of assigning a new valuation for the land and trailer altered the physical facts of the property's assessment and its valuation, which constituted a new assessment of the property that could only be done on a countywide basis. Thus, the Board had no authority under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5452.13 to reassess the property beyond the change produced by the addition of the trailer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an adult theatre and a realty company, appealed from two orders by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) in an eminent domain case dismissing and overruling the preliminary objections of the theatre and the realty company to the declaration of taking filed by respondent, an urban redevelopment authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The theatre alleged that it was improperly barred from filing objections to the taking. The appellate court held that the theatre's duty to file timely objections was triggered by actual notice to a related party. The authority had a generally applicable power to combat blight and to promote economic redevelopment. The authority's exercise of its eminent domain power to combat blight did not transform the taking into a time, place, and manner restriction on free speech. The only direct evidence of the authority's view of the use of the property as an adult theatre was its acknowledgement that there was a perception that the adult theatre was part of the negative image of the area and was a factor in the decision not to permit new adult uses in the redevelopment plan. The authority's action was not subject to strict scrutiny as a content-based restriction on First Amendment rights. The intermediate scrutiny test was met. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to analyze independently the claims under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Even if a least intrusive means test was applied, the least restrictive means for accomplishing a legitimate governmental interest was employed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the process of amending Pennsylvania DNA Detection of Sexual and Violent Offenders Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 7651 et seq., the Pennsylvania House of Representatives gave the bill a new title. It provided that the bill amended the Pennsylvania Judicial Code and that the bill provided, in part, for DNA testing for certain offenders and for the apportionment of liability and damages in negligence actions. The title of the bill remained when it was passed. The representatives asserted that the amended act, 2002 Pa. Laws 57, violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 1, 3. The appellate court found that the representatives stated a claim under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3, which prohibited passage of bills containing more than one subject. Requiring DNA samples from felony sex offenders did not relate to joint and several liability. Also, the expungement of a DNA record under 2002 Pa. Laws 57 did not relate to the main purpose of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4701 et seq. The representatives failed to state a claim under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, which prohibited deceptive titles, as they did not allege that the title was so unclear as to be fraudulent or deceptive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker resigned from her job after her husband was transferred to Ohio as part of his employment. Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 802(b), provided that an employee was ineligible for benefits when her unemployment was the result of her voluntarily terminating her employment without a necessitous and compelling reason. The necessitous and compelling reason requirement referred to real and substantial circumstances that forced the employee to terminate employment and that would compel a reasonable person under those circumstances to act in the same manner. The court found that the worker and her husband had maintained separate living arrangements for some time prior to the worker's resignation. The court held that the worker offered no evidence of economic hardship in maintaining separate living arrangements or that her move to Ohio caused insurmountable commuting problems. The commuting problems alleged in the present case involved a more onerous commute to spend weekends together, and these commuting problems did not give rise to an award of benefits. The court held that the worker's resignation was based on a personal preference and a desire to maintain the family unit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant licensee sought review of an order of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Bucks (Pennsylvania), which sustained a one-year suspension of his driver's license by appellee, the Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, under the Driver's License Compact, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1581-1586, after the licensee was convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI) in New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was arrested and convicted in New Jersey for DWI, after which the Department suspended his driver's license. On appeal, the licensee argued that his citizenship privileges and immunities and other constitutional rights had been violated. The court held that the Compact did not impose penalties for driving under the influence convictions on the basis of state citizenship because it enforced, without discrimination, the same rule. Thus, there was no disparate treatment by either New Jersey or Pennsylvania and the U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2 privileges and immunities claim failed. Nor was there any merit to the licensee's claim that his fundamental right to travel were abrogated because that right did not include the right to be excused from another state's highway laws and the licensee merely made bald assertions that he was treated more harshly than New Jersey drivers who were convicted of DWI. Similarly, the licensee's claim of disparate treatment of Pennsylvanians was an equal protection claim that had been rejected by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Finally, the licensee's claims under the Pennsylvania Constitution were not presented adequately to merit review.</SPAN></P>
