</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the application for supervisory writ filed by the defendants, individually and as a business, to review the trial court's denial of an exception of no cause of action asserted in response to an amended petition filed by the plaintiffs, a corporation, and its corporate president.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's petition alleged an oral agreement whereunder it would provide paralegal services for defendants in exchange for fee splitting. Plaintiffs alleged defendants breached, and prayed for judicial recognition thereof, payment in accordance therewith, and damages. Defendants argued that since quantum meruit and unjust enrichment were causes of action based on contract, recovery was impossible where the underlying contract was illegal. By granting the exception of no cause of action, the trial court determined the contract was null and unenforceable. Although plaintiff intended to state a claim for unjust enrichment, and attempted to do so, the petition failed to allege facts with sufficient specificity to support the claim. Therefore, the trial court erred in denying the exception of no cause of action regarding unjust enrichment. The court believed remand was warranted to afford plaintiffs an opportunity to amend its petition to state a cause of action in accord with this opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that it was error for the trial court to deny the exception, reversing and remanding the matter to allow plaintiff to amend its petition, if possible, to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an automobile accident in which their father was killed in a vehicle driven by their mother, plaintiff minor children, through their uncle as provisional tutor, instituted wrongful death and survival action against defendant mother and insurers. The suit was met with an exception of no right of action on behalf of defendant mother. Recognizing application of Louisiana's parent-child immunity statute, the trial court granted the exception and dismissed the suit. Plaintiffs challenged application of the statute and alternately challenged its constitutionality. The court affirmed. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:571 was a procedural bar prohibiting actions by unemancipated minor children against their parents during the children's minority, and the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Grant of exception of no right of action and dismissal of case, applying statutory parent-child immunity, was affirmed, as statute was not unconstitutional and defendant mother was immune from suit by plaintiff children during children's minority, in keeping with long-recognized policy of promoting family harmony and maintaining family control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of one count of aggravated rape, a violation of La. Rev. Stat.

Defendant appealed, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence against him as well as urging that the district court imposed an unduly harsh and excessive sentence which also failed to sufficiently articulate and consider the La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 guidelines. The court affirmed. The evidence before the jury was sufficient to convict defendant of aggravated rape. Defendant had not shown that his sentence was excessive or that he was the exceptional defendant who deserved otherwise. The circumstances of the offense were serious. Defendant used physical force and threats to rape a 13-year-old girl whom he stalked for days prior to his crime. The sentence was not cruel, unusual or excessive, nor did it shock the court's sense of justice.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:94(A), (F). The trial court sentenced defendant to the mandatory minimum term of ten years imprisonment. Defendant appealed, asserting four assignments of error. Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed. Defendant argued the actions of the district attorney and the trial court resulted in his being denied a fair trial. In addition, defendant claimed that his sentence was excessive. The facts presented at trial supported the district attorney's decision to prosecute defendant. Defendant knew that he was to be tried for illegal use of a weapon during a crime of violence; there was no element of surprise. The court found no merit in defendant's constitutional attack on La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:94(A), (F). The addition of a firearm into the situation of an aggravated assault justified the enhanced penalty provision; and defendant failed to show that such enhanced penalty represented a purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering or was grossly out of proportion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted by a jury of attempted carjacking, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:27 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64.2. Defendant was subsequently adjudicated a third felony habitual offender and sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant appealed the conviction and sentence on grounds of insufficient evidence to convict, ineffective assistance of counsel, and excessive sentence. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. Defendant's general argument was that his constitutional right to due process was violated because of the identification procedures employed. The court rejected defendant's argument. Defendant contended that counsel's performance fell below the standard of counsel guaranteed by the U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court agreed that certain comments by a witness improperly referred to other crimes evidence within the purview of La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 404. Nevertheless, the court could not determine that defendant had shown he was prejudiced by counsel's failure to object. Finally, the sentence of life imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence did not shock the court's sense of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment in the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, which convicted him for placing combustible materials and imposed sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his brother allegedly initiated racially inspired altercations against two African-American victims, which culminated in defendant and his brother allegedly pouring gasoline on the victims' vehicles with the intent to set them on fire. Defendant was convicted of placing combustible materials and appealed. The appellate court affirmed the conviction, finding that: La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:54 was facially valid since it charged a crime and not an inchoate offense; instruction to jurors pertaining to the voting, viewed in the entire context of the jurors' misunderstanding regarding the method for recording the verdicts, was not coercive and did not rise to the Allen/Nicholson level; rational trier of fact could have concluded beyond reasonable doubt that defendant aided and abetted in commission of the crime, or directly or indirectly counseled his brother to place the gasoline in or near the cars, with the specific intent to set fire to such movable; habitual offender finding was vacated, as the trial court erred in failing to advise defendant of his right to remain silent prior to his admission of the underlying offense during the habitual offender colloquy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction was affirmed. The multiple offender adjudication and sentence were vacated, and remanded for rehearing on the multiple bill and resentencing.

Conclusion that defendant aided and abetted his brother in committing the crime was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for forcible rape and his sentence of twenty years imprisonment, as a second felony offender from the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of rape. The trial court properly allowed the state to enter testimony regarding defendant's actions with the victim prior to her twelfth birthday. The dates set forth in the indictment and the bill of particulars included offenses both before and after the victim's twelfth birthday. Thus, he was fully informed of the essential facts of the crime charged. Defendant complained the trial court erred in finding him to be a second-felony offender. Because ten years had not passed from the time defendant was convicted on the predicate offense, the state established the cleansing period had not elapsed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs represented over 25,000 persons who signed a petition seeking to have the Home Rule Charter of the City of New Orleans amended to provide for a local minimum wage. The City Council refused to pass the ordinance providing for the publication of the amendment. A petition for writ of mandamus was filed on May 12, 1997, seeking to compel the city council to act. On June 18, 1997, the state legislature enacted La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:642, prohibiting a local government from establishing a minimum wage. The effective date of the statute was August 15, 1997. The trial court opined that &sect; 23:642 was proper pursuant to the State's police powers under La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9. Thus, city council did not have to hold an election. Because the question of whether &sect; 23:642 was applicable to the city had not been answered, the proposed amendment to the city charter providing for a minimum wage was not invalid on its face. It, therefore, should be placed on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and remanded; because the question of whether the statute, prohibiting a local government from establishing a minimum wage, applied to the city had not been answered, the city council was required to place issue of a local minimum wage on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his brother allegedly initiated racially inspired altercations against two African-American victims, which culminated in defendant and his brother allegedly pouring gasoline on the victims' vehicles with the intent to set them on fire. Defendant was convicted of placing combustible materials and of violation of the hate crimes statute. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, finding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:54 was facially valid because it charged a crime and not an inchoate offense; defendant's racially-motivated statements to the arresting officer were admissible as res gestae recitation of the facts of the encounter; and the record on appeal was supplemented with the complete transcript of the voir dire, and there was no limitation in questioning for potential bias with regard to pre-trial publicity. Defendant's sentence was vacated and remanded, as the trial judge imposed the statutory restriction that the sentences be served without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence after imposing all three sentences, but failed to specify the limitation was only imposed on the La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee department of state civil service (DSCS) effected a structure adjustment to the existing pay plan for state classified employees. Appellant hospital employees attacked that action. In light of its factual findings, the civil service commission (CSC) concluded that implementation of the 1997 pay structure adjustment did not impermissibly discriminate against senior employees. Detailed provisions on the civil service and merit system were included in La. Const. art. X, &sect; 7. The CSC, which had executive, legislative, and judicial powers, was required to hold a public hearing to consider any pay plans or adjustments, which it did. The pay plan became effective only when approved by the governor in its entirety, and he did not have the right to amend or modify the plan, but merely to approve or disapprove it. The court found that the constitutional right at issue was not seniority but the preservation of the merit system to ensure public service free from political favoritism. The court found no manifest error on the part of CSC as to its factual findings and found that its decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. There was no manifest error in civil service commission's approval of appellee's pay plans or pay adjustments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a judgment in the 22nd Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of St. Tammany (Louisiana), which applied retroactively a legislative enactment that shortened the period of inactivity constituting an abandonment of a cause of action from five to three years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a personal injury lawsuit, seeking damages arising out of an automobile accident. At the time the lawsuit was filed, the applicable statute provided for dismissal of actions on the basis of abandonment where a party failed to take a step in its prosecution or defense in the trial court for a period of five years. Subsequently, the legislature shortened the time period provided from five to three years. The trial court issued an order dismissing plaintiff's suit for nonprosecution, as no action had been taken in the matter for over a three-year period. Plaintiff moved to set aside the order, arguing that the retroactive application of the amendment to her suit was unconstitutional. The motion was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed dismissal, finding that the language evidenced a clear legislative intent that the amended legislation be applied retroactively. Plaintiff had a reasonable period following the enactment of the amendment to afford her opportunity to take action in order to preserve her rights. Therefore, the shortened time period provided for in the amendment was applicable to plaintiff's case, which was pending on the effective date of the amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Because plaintiff's suit was pending on the effective date of the amendment, it fell within the category of cases the legislature intended to be subject to the reduced period provided for in the amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sustained defendants' exception of prescription and peremption and dismissed plaintiff's legal malpractice suit as untimely. Plaintiff argued the one and three-year time limitations did not apply to her suit because of the fraud exception in La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9:5605(E).The court held plaintiff's well-pleaded allegations of fact in her supplemental and amended petition for damages was sufficient to allege fraud. Because the one and three-year limitations of La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9:5605(A) were peremptive, the fraud exception of La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9:5605(E) was applicable to both. Therefore, the usual manifest error standard of review for factual findings was not appropriate under the peculiar posture of the record. Based on the foregoing, the court vacated the judgment sustaining the defendants' exception and dismissing the action as untimely.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed appellants' requests; on appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court was correct in concluding that appellant daughter was not a forced heir under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, city and individuals, petitioned for a declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat.

Plaintiffs failed to make a prima facie showing that the statute was unconstitutional; thus a temporary injunction was not warranted. Plaintiffs' claim that the city was a separate legal entity organized under a home rule charter was rejected. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1300.21 in no way intruded on plaintiff city's structure of government. The statute constituted a general law rather than a local or special law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which convicted him of second degree murder, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second degree murder after shooting and killing the victim while in a confrontation with another man. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, finding that evidence presented by the State established that defendant was the aggressor in the conflict and not entitled to claim self-defense; and defendant had the specific intent to kill the other man or to inflict great bodily harm on him, and that intent was transferred, through the doctrine of transferred intent, to the victim. At trial, dismissal of a prospective juror for cause was proper, as her responses revealed facts from which her inability to render judgment according to the law could reasonably be inferred. Additionally, the offense of negligent homicide was not fairly supported by the evidence, and thus, defendant's special jury charge was not pertinent. Finally, defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, as defense failed to show its failure to discover the evidence at the time of trial was not caused by lack of diligence, that the evidence was material, or that the evidence would probably have produced a different verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Defendant was not entitled to claim of self-defense, as evidence established that defendant was the aggressor in the confrontation in which the victim was killed and, under the transferred intent doctrine, defendant's specific intent to kill the other man was transferred to the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The act amended two separate statutory articles addressing various forms of publications by various local governing authorities. Trial court denied plaintiff's requested relief. The court affirmed, concluding that the various provisions of the act had a natural connection and reasonably related to a single object, and the court found no merit in plaintiff's argument that the act had dual objects. The overall objective of controlling amounts spent by public bodies for the purpose of advertisement, whether promotional or otherwise, was apparent.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that the exemption from the imposition of the state sales and use tax on medical devices permitted under the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:305D(1)(s) applied to sales and use tax levies by taxing authorities. The court reversed. The sole issue raised on appeal was whether the medical device exemption from the state sales and use tax levies applied to the same tax by local taxing authorities. Local taxing authorities, including appellant, were not precluded from imposing sales and use tax levies on the sale of medical devices. Accordingly, the court concluded the trial court erred in determining appellee was exempt from the payment of the sales and use taxes levied on the sale of medical devices.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of distribution of cocaine. The trial court denied his motion to reconsider sentence and sentenced him as a habitual offender. On appeal, defendant alleged that the State did not meet its burden of proving the validity of the prior conviction used to adjudicate him a second habitual offender. The court affirmed the adjudication as a habitual offender, finding that the State introduced the minute entry of the predicate plea showing defendant was represented by counsel. Thus, the burden shifted to defendant to show an infringement of his rights or procedural irregularity at the taking of the plea, which defendant failed to satisfy. Defendant's objection was nothing more than a reliance on the absence of any notation in the minute entry that the trial court advised defendant of the three Boykin rights. Thus, the objection was insufficient to shift the burden back to the State to produce a &quot;perfect&quot; transcript of the guilty plea. Further, the court found defendant failed to prove the minimum statutory sentence was unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with two counts of attempted armed robbery and found guilty. The State then charged him as a third felony offender. After adjudication, the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, sentenced appellant to concurrent sentences of life in prison without parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, and 35 years at hard labor without benefit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, charged and convicted of two counts of armed robbery, sought review from his conviction. Appellant argued that identification failed because nobody present at the time of the time of the offense could identify him. The instant court held that there was no contention that the photo lineup was unduly suggestive. The inconsistencies did not undermine witness' ability to identify appellant in the lineup and video. Whether he had the motive to accuse appellant falsely of the crime was a credibility issue for the jury. Further, the court held that appellant had not made the requisite extraordinary showing such that the videotape of the offense should be excluded on the grounds that it was more prejudicial than probative. Appellant's conduct showed an amoral disregard for life and property, and the trial court aptly noted his serious criminal history. The record did not show, clearly and convincingly, that appellant was exceptional or the victim of the mandates of the habitual offender law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(b)(ii). His concurrent sentences did not shock the court's sense of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for stealing a van and ripping out its stereo and air conditioner. On appeal, the court affirmed. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for armed robbery because the victim's identification of defendant was reliable. He saw defendant standing near his van immediately before the robbery, he was face to face with defendant during the robbery, and he identified defendant in a photographic lineup one day after the robbery. The trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to quash the multiple bill of information adding the firearm charge even though almost two years elapsed between his conviction and its filing. He was not prejudiced because even if he had been sentenced to the minimum sentence on the original conviction, he would still have been incarcerated when the multiple bill was filed. Defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive given his criminal history including two manslaughter convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because the victim's identification of defendant was reliable, defendant would still have been incarcerated when multiple bill was filed even if he had only been sentenced to the minimum on his armed robbery conviction, and because defendant had twice previously been convicted of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), decision after his conviction of attempted solicitation for crime against nature and was adjudicated a third-felony habitual offender.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of attempted solicitation for crime against nature and was adjudicated a third-felony habitual offender. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, and held the court did not err in denying defendant's motion in arrest of judgment, because the offense charged was punishable under a valid statute. Defendant was charged under state crime against nature statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:89 (A)(2). Defendant did not prove that the statute was unconstitutional as it applied to him, so the statute was presumed valid. It was not error to find the evidence established the elements of the offense of solicitation for crime against nature because the rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and defendant was thus a third-felony habitual offender. Testimony by an undercover police officer supported the conviction. The trial court did not err in finding defendant guilty of attempted solicitation for crime against nature. Defense counsel never objected, as required by the contemporaneous objection rule, La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 841 (A), because the verdict favored his client.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because defendant failed to prove his charge of attempted solicitation of crime against nature was not punishable under a valid statute, and trial court properly denied the motion in arrest of judgment. The undercover police officer's testimony sufficiently supported the conviction. Defense counsel never objected to verdict, so issue not appealable. Defendant a third-felony habitual offender as statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court (Louisiana) convicting him of attempted possession of cocaine and possession of marijuana, and sentencing him as a third felony offender to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted after arranging a drug sale for an undercover officer. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court did not err in finding appellant guilty because the state proved that appellant had a predisposition to commit the crime, and disproved appellant's entrapment defense. While the officer asked to purchase cocaine from appellant, appellant quickly assured him that he could obtain cocaine, offered the officer marijuana, and encouraged the officer to wait on the delivery. The evidence was sufficient to prove appellant was guilty of possession of marijuana that was found in the shed because appellant and his co-defendant exercised joint control over the shed. Appellant specifically told the officer that the marijuana was in the shed and was in the shed's vicinity while negotiating with the officer. Appellant's sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive given his previous convictions and history of involvement in drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because the state proved that appellant was predisposed to sell cocaine, appellant exercised control over the shed in which the marijuana was found and told the undercover officer of same, and because appellant had been previously convicted and had a history of involvement in drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment in the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, which convicted him on counts of possession of heroin and possession of cocaine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police were conducting a roadblock at the entrance ramp to an interstate, with the purpose of checking for proof of insurance. Defendant was observed backing off the entrance ramp. Police detained defendant, and during the detention observed drug paraphernalia on the front seat of defendant's car. Defendant was convicted for possession of heroin and cocaine. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the action of police in detaining defendant briefly to ascertain if a lack of insurance was the cause of his attempt to evade the roadblock was reasonable under the circumstances. Further, when stopped, the troopers noticed the defendant was very nervous, somewhat shaking, and sweating profusely. Coupled with the fact that he had no driver's license, no proof of insurance, and no registration, the officers had reasonable suspicion to glance in the vehicle wherein the seized items were found in plain view. Additionally, the evidence found in defendant's possession was sufficient to prove defendant's illegal possession of cocaine and heroin.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Police acted reasonably in the initial stop and detention of defendant, based on defendant's attempt to evade administrative roadblock, and defendant's behavior after being stopped caused reasonable suspicion for police to seize items in plain view in defendant's vehicle.</SPAN></P>

Appellees contended that appellant commission's accrued leave rule violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1996, and that its rule on longevity pay increases violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1192(B). Appellees moved for partial summary judgment as to liability on the statutory wage and accrued leave claims and the trial court granted the motion. The court affirmed. The court found that &sect; 33:1996 prohibited placement of a ceiling on the amount of annual leave that appellees could accrue. Appellant commission's longevity pay rules were far less generous than &sect; 33:1192(B).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was injured while working for appellee. After appellee paid appellant temporary total disability (TTD) benefits for eight years, his benefits were modified to supplemental earnings benefits (SEB).

The workers' compensation judge found that appellant was not entitled to any further benefits. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Existence of pain was not a pertinent factor in the issue of TTD. Given conflicting medical evidence, the workers' compensation judge was not clearly wrong in finding that appellant was not entitled to TTD or PTD benefits. However, termination of appellant's SEB benefits after 104 weeks under &sect; 23:1221(3)(d)(iii) violated La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff-appellee was a dental laboratory technician who fabricated and repaired dentures.

The matter was referred to the appellant state dental board and it determined that appellee had engaged in six counts of the unauthorized practice of dentistry and assessed a $ 5000 civil penalty for each count against her. She sought review and argued that the appellant had exceeded its statutory authority. The trial court vacated the appellant's decision and it sought review. The court affirmed and found that the appellant lacked statutory authority to impose civil penalties upon non-licensed individuals. It further found that the appellant's authority was limited to revoking, suspending, or restricting professional licenses of individuals who possessed a currently valid license or those with a suspended or revoked license.</SPAN></P>

The Habitual Offender Law mandated defendant be imprisoned for life, and because sentence was mandatory, there was not prejudice for failure to observe the delay for sentencing. Defendant failed to rebut presumption that mandatory life sentence was constitutional; thus, the sentence was not excessive. Evidence was sufficient to show defendant was the person convicted of the crimes alleged, and the state properly utilized the attempted simple escape conviction as a predicate. Because defendant was sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence, the pre-sentence investigation would not have abrogated the judge's legal obligation to impose the mandatory sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of conviction and sentence as a habitual offender were affirmed. Police had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant and, when defendant fled and discarded gun, police had probable cause for arrest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance company appealed a partial summary judgment from Civil District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which was designated as final. The judgment held La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1406D(1)(a)(iii) obliged the court to apply Louisiana law to a foreign insurance contract covering an accident in Louisiana involving Louisiana residents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, residents of New York State, while visiting New Orleans, were involved in a violent and life threatening collision due to joint fault of their taxi driver and the other vehicle operator. Appellees sued in Louisiana to recover damages sustained in the collision. Appellant moved for summary judgment, arguing that because the Louisiana tortfeasor had liability coverage exceeding its uninsured motorist (UM) limits, under New York law, it did not owe any UM benefits to its insured, appellees. The district court denied the motion, holding that because the accident arose in Louisiana and involved at least two Louisiana residents, Louisiana law should have been applied to interpret the policy. Pursuant to Louisiana law, appellant owed coverage to the full extent of its policy limits and was not permitted to apply the New York offset clause. Judgment was affirmed; the trial court correctly held Louisiana's UM Statute applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with two counts of robbery arising out of two separate incidents. Both counts were tried together and appellant was convicted. After his original sentence was imposed, appellant was found to be a habitual offender and resentenced to 49 1/2 years on each count, to run consecutively. Appellant sought review, arguing that the trial court erred by failing to sever the counts for trial, in finding him to be a second offender, and by imposing an unconstitutionally excessive sentence. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The trial court did not err when it did not sever the counts because the two robberies, charged in the same indictment, could be tried together if they were of similar character and if they did not prejudice the appellant. The state established both a prior felony conviction and that appellant was the person convicted of that felony, so finding appellant to be a second offender was not erroneous. Finally, the record showed an adequate factual basis that supported the sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction and sentence affirmed; the two charges were sufficiently similar and appellant was not prejudiced by joinder, he was a second offender because he had been previously convicted of a felony, and the record showed an adequate factual basis for the sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State appealed from a judgment of the 23rd Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Ascension (Louisiana) for the plaintiffs where defendant was held to be 70 percent at fault in causing an automobile accident that resulted in plaintiffs receiving personal injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a husband and wife and their minor daughter, brought suit against defendant State, through its transportation department and a parish police jury, when they suffered personal injuries in an accident. Plaintiffs contended that the intersection where the accident occurred was unreasonably dangerous and defective and that defendant was strictly liable to plaintiffs under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2317, or alternatively that defendant had actual or constructive notice of the vices or defects in the roadways under their custody and were negligent in the maintenance of the intersection in question. Defendant parish police jury settled with plaintiffs. The trial court held for plaintiffs, holding defendant 70 percent at fault. Defendant appealed. The court evaluated plaintiff husband's duty to stop at intersections and yield the right of way to approaching vehicles that could constitute a hazard, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:123B, and held that he had failed to stop to determine if any approaching traffic constituted an immediate danger, thus violating his statutory duty as a driver. The trial court judgment was amended so plaintiff husband was reallocated 50 percent fault.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the trial court judgment allocating 70 percent fault to defendant State and 30 percent fault to defendant husband to reallocating 50 percent fault to defendant State and 50 percent fault to defendant husband, and further amending the judgment to reflect a total award to the plaintiffs that included legal interest from the date of judicial demand until paid.</SPAN></P>

The trial court correctly sustained the exception of no cause of action because appellant failed to state claims under the Civil Rights Act, state contract or tort law, and or any constitutional claims. The court held that appellant had ample access to the courts. The fact that appellant could present his case only before a judge without oral argument and not before a jury did not deny him access to the courts. The court adopted the report concluding appellant failed to state claims of either due process or equal protection violations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate appealed the judgment of the East Baton Rouge Parish District Court, Louisiana, dismissing his petition challenging the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.5 as frivolous and failing to state a cognizable claim, and ordering the judgment be considered a &quot;strike&quot; under the Prison Litigation Reform Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed an action seeking that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.5, which required that he be subject to parole supervision after early release for good behavior, be declared unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed plaintiff's petition and ordered the that the judgment be considered a strike. On appeal, the court affirmed the action's dismissal. Section 15:571.5 did not violate plaintiff's substantive due process rights because he had no liberty interest in being released early without parole as &sect; 15:571.5 was in effect when he was sentenced, and therefore he could not have expected that he would be released early without parole. Nor did &sect; 15:571.5 violate plaintiff's equal protection rights because a rational basis existed for the parole requirement as the award of good time was a disciplinary tool. However, the trial court erred by ordering that the dismissal be considered a strike under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1187 because plaintiff's action did not concern conditions or actions affecting the lives of incarcerated prisoners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed insofar as it assessed a &quot;strike&quot; against plaintiff under the Prison Litigation Reform Act because plaintiff's action concerning his supervision once he was no longer incarcerated was not an action that triggered the sanction. Judgment otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who had been convicted and sentenced as an habitual offender under La. Rev.

Appellant claimed this was discrimination as other prisoners who had committed the same number of offenses, were not charged as habitual offenders, and this violated his equal protection right under the La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Holding that &sect; 15:571.3(C) was rationally related to the legitimate state purpose of providing punishment and deterrence and in preventing the early release of those the criminal justice system treated as serious repeat offenders, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that in initially charging appellant under &sect; 15:529.1, the prosecutor was cloaked in the unfettered discretion to decide who, when, and how to prosecute an accused pursuant to La. Code Crim. P. art. 61. The court noted that appellant had not alleged that he belonged to a suspect class, and that there was no fundamental right to the award of time off for good behavior, and applied the rational basis test to resolve appellant's attack on &sect; 15:571.3(C) by upholding the statute and affirming the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment denying appellant a diminution in sentence, because under the rational basis standard of review, the habitual offender statute was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of providing punishment and deterrence and in preventing the early release of those the criminal justice system treated as serious repeat offenders, which was sufficient for equal protection analysis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff debtor sued bankruptcy trustee's counsel, which plaintiff retained after defendant counsel found fraud in stock sale contested by plaintiff but authorized by bankruptcy court without reservation of rights and without objection. Defendant filed a RICO action against the stock purchasers, which was dismissed on res judicata and collateral estoppel because plaintiff's original counsel had not appealed the bankruptcy authorization order. Plaintiff sued both counsel for legal malpractice. Defendant cross-claimed against original counsel for contribution and indemnity. The trial judge found for plaintiff and against defendant only, dismissing original counsel and cross-claims. During defendant's appeal, the Louisiana Supreme Court decided a possibly relevant case. Plaintiff was allowed to argue the unconstitutionality of retroactively applying La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5605 to bar his claim. The trial court found the statute constitutional but inapplicable. The court agreed but reversed, holding defendant solely liable for all plaintiff's damages, finding defendant 40 percent liable, declining treble damages, and substantially reducing the award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction by jury, in the Third Judicial District Court for the Parish of Lincoln, Louisiana, of aggravated rape, in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not err in granting the State's challenges to prospective jurors for cause where the jurors' inability to render judgment according to law could reasonably be inferred from their testimony. With respect to claimed error concerning a suggestive photographic lineup procedure and the State's failure to inform the defendant during discovery that he could be identified by the victim, the defendant failed to demonstrate substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification or show such substantial prejudice as to deprive him of a reasonable expectation of a fair trial. The evidence was sufficient to prove that the defendant committed the offense. Even if allegedly unconstitutional language referring to a victim's age was excised from the aggravated rape statute under which the defendant was prosecuted, the defendant could have been charged and convicted pursuant to the statute. The court examined the record for patent error and found none.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction and sentence affirmed. State's suggestive identification procedure and failure to inform defendant during discovery of identification by victim did not require reversal where defendant failed to show misidentification or substantial prejudice. Evidence was sufficient to prove offense. Aggravated rape statute was sufficient even if allegedly unconstitutional language was excised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for possession of 28 grams or more, but less than 200 grams, of cocaine, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(F)(1). The trial court denied defendant's motions for new trial and post-verdict judgment of acquittal, sentencing him to 10 years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence, imposing an excessive sentence, and failing to advise him of the prescriptive period to apply for post-conviction relief. The court observed that defendant's sentence was patently too lenient, as it omitted a fine pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(F)(1)(a). Such error was not reviewable as it favored defendant without objection by the State. However, the trial judge's conclusion that he could not deviate from the mandatory minimum sentence was erroneous and required remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish's (Louisiana) judgment that convicted defendant of distribution of cocaine, under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of distribution of cocaine pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967 and was sentenced as a third felony offender, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:259.1. On appeal, the court held that defendant's insufficiency of evidence argument was without merit because a jury could have reasonably concluded that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Furthermore, the court held that defendant's argument regarding the absence of Boykin transcripts was not preserved for review. Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel argument was without merit because the court held that, based on evidence of the constitutional propriety of defendant's prior guilty pleas, defendant was not prejudiced by counsel's failure to obtain Boykin transcripts. Finally, the court stated that defendant's sentence, under &sect; 15:259.1, was illegally lenient, but that plaintiff, the prosecution, failed to raise the issue. Considering defendant's criminal history, the sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive and was not grossly out of proportion to the offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with second degree murder of her husband in violation of La. Rev. Stat. 14:30.1. She was sentenced to 21 years at hard labor, with 16 years suspended and five years active probation. On appeal, defendant claimed the trial court erred in refusing to admit the proffered testimony of a psychiatrist regarding her being the victim of domestic violence and her mental state three weeks after the killing. The court agreed with the trial court that the evidence was irrelevant, as well as evidence of insanity or mental defect when defendant was being tried upon a plea of not guilty, and therefore inadmissible under La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 651. The court also found that the trial court correctly excluded domestic violence pamphlets from evidence when defendant was attempting to support a physician's credibility, which could have been done only with general reputation evidence referring to the witness's truthfulness. The court also found that computer records of phone calls admitted were not hearsay because they were not stored declarations dependent on a human's observation and recording, and thus not &quot;statements&quot;. Conviction and sentence affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentencing by the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana) for drug possession raising several issues on appeal, including the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence, the sentence imposed by the trial court, and denial of motion to suppress defendant's confession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted of drug possession after being found in a car with a quantity of cocaine. The defendant was sentenced to 10 years hard labor with no parole, probation, or suspension of the sentence. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the bag of cocaine found by officers during a search incident to his arrest. The denial was affirmed: the evidence was found in plain view during a search supported by a &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; of the police due to defendant's behavior and an informant's tip. Defendant also challenged the trial court's application of the mandatory minimum sentence. The court found the trial court erred in not considering whether the mandatory minimum sentence would have been excessive as applied to the defendant given the totality of the circumstances. The defendant also raised a challenge to the denial of his motion to suppress his confession; the court held his confession to be voluntary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was a long history of physical abuse of appellant's three minor children. The State removed the children from appellant's custody. The children were subsequently adjudicated children in need of care. The State attempted to help appellant become a better parent, with the intention of reuniting her with her children. Although two case plans were implemented, appellant continued to demonstrate her inability to provide for her children's education, care, and support. Trial court terminated appellant's parental rights. On appeal, appellant attacked, on the ground of vagueness, the constitutionality of the statute governing the standard of care expected of parents. Judgment affirmed. Relevant statute was not unconstitutionally vague as it provided appellant competent notice of the measure of care and support owed to her children. Termination of parental rights was proper as appellant did not comply with court order or case plan requirement to provide substantial contributions to her children's support.</SPAN></P>

Application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208 to penalize plaintiff for willful and fraudulent misconduct was not error because the evidence clearly showed that plaintiff sought to misguide the WCJ in its claim that defendant did not act within established procedures.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for distribution of cocaine and possession of a firearm while distributing cocaine. He also appealed the denial of his motions for a new trial and post judgment verdict of acquittal. The court affirmed the conviction for distribution of cocaine and the denial of defendant's post trial motions, finding the defendant failed to raise the arguments constituting the foundation for those motions at trial preventing their review on appeal pursuant to La.

The court vacated the conviction for possession of a firearm while distributing cocaine, finding that conviction violated the defendant's double jeopardy rights under the United States and Louisiana constitutions. The &quot;same evidence&quot; rule was applicable in that the offenses were substantially similar and the same evidence was required for conviction of both offenses. The court remanded for resentencing as the trial court failed to comply with La. Code Crim. Proc.

On appeal, the court found no manifest error in the finding that appellant committed a willful misrepresentation concerning mileage.

The evidence was sufficient at the multiple bill hearing to establish defendant's prior felony convictions and, as to certain issues, defendant failed to preserve them on the record for appeal in accordance with La.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:69; and which adjudicated defendant a fourth-felony habitual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers discovered defendant sleeping in the rear seat of a van with its engine running and without a license plate. The van's steering column had been damaged. Defendant was convicted for possession of stolen property. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that defendant was an occupant capable of exercising control over the van. The condition of the van alerted defendant that its past was dubious, and the fact that the engine was running was fairly strong circumstantial evidence that defendant did not just stumble upon it; thus a rational jury could have found each of the four elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the court found that defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive, and that the trial court's failure to give defendant 15 days in which to file particular objections to the habitual offender bill was not error because defendant failed to object to any procedural irregularity in holding the hearing on the same day as the filing of the bill of information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The jury was reasonable in finding that the State proved the four elements of the crime; there was sufficient circumstantial evidence that defendant knew the vehicle in which he was sleeping was stolen. Sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive. Defendant's failure to object to the holding of the hearing on habitual offender bill on the same day as filing of the bill of information precluded review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, age 15 at the time of the offense, was convicted of second degree murder of a juvenile. Defendant's motions to suppress and to change venue were denied by the trial court. The court affirmed, holding that there was not such prejudice in the collective mind of the community that a fair trial was impossible. The media coverage was neither so extensive nor so inflammatory as to require a change of venue. Second, defendant's confession was not illegal, as defendant and his parents were informed of his rights and the waiver of rights was later explained to defendant in the presence of his father. They indicated they did not want an attorney. Although defendant's consultation with his father occurred after the waiver was executed, it preceded his confession. Finally, considering that this was a senseless and violent murder of a juvenile, the sentence was not grossly disproportionate to the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed dropping something from his hand when confronted by police officers. An investigatory stop revealed a bag of crack cocaine, and a search incident to arrest turned up an envelope of heroin on defendant's person. The court denied his motion to suppress. Defendant was convicted and identified as a multiple offender with prior felony convictions, and given a mandatory life sentence. Defendant argued his offenses were improperly joined, since they were not subject to the same mode of trial as to number of jurors, that reasonable suspicion to detain him had existed, and that highly unusual circumstances rendered the life sentence constitutionally excessive, cruel, and unusual punishment. The court of appeals affirmed as to each argument. Defendant was the kind of dangerous habitual felon the life sentence was intended to remove from society. The investigatory stop was reasonable given the neighborhood, where drug activity complaints were common.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction and sentence were affirmed. Defendant was properly tried to a jury of 12, and joinder of the two drug charges for a single trial was proper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were tried together by a jury that found them both guilty of second degree murder. Defendants were both sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.

The inconsistencies in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses were brought to the jury's attention, but the jury had to have found the testimony sufficiently consistent and credible in finding both defendants guilty; thus the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that both defendants committed the crime. One defendant appealed the sentence as excessive, but he did not prove the trial judge abused his discretion in imposing the mandatory life sentence, and he did not rebut the presumption that the sentence was constitutional. He was not deprived of his due process rights by not being provided with a trial transcript.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing evidence was insufficient for conviction of unauthorized entry, and the trial court erred in giving a jury instruction on a lesser-included offense of second degree battery. Defendant argued the victim authorized him to enter the house. The victim conceded defendant could generally enter through any door, as he often visited his daughter there. However, the court held the relevant question was whether this particular entry was authorized. The court held the victim would not have consented to entry if the victim had seen defendant coming to the back door with a hammer.

On appeal, defendant contended the evidence was insufficient for conviction. The court affirmed, holding that the evidence showed that defendant shot and killed the victim during the commission of a second degree kidnapping. A witness testified that he saw defendant walking down the driveway holding a revolver to the victim's head. Furthermore, the evidence revealed defendant possessed the specific intent to kill the victim as defendant pointed the .357 at the victim's head and pulled the trigger. The shot was fired at close range. Defendant's act of pointing a gun at the victim's head while firing it was evidence from which a reasonable person could conclude he had specific intent to kill. The court also held defendant's self-defense argument had no merit. No witnesses saw the victim with a weapon, and there was no evidence that the victim fired shots at the defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his arrest for being a felon convicted of a violent crime in possession of a handgun, defendant, relying on a letter entitled &quot;verification of first offender pardon&quot; informing him that he had been fully pardoned of the offense and that all rights of citizenship and franchise had been restored in Louisiana, from the Department of Public Safety and Corrections, and noticed an affirmative defense of mistake of law. The state moved to prohibit the mistake of law defense, which motion was denied by the trial court. On review, the court reversed. In purchasing his handgun, the defendant relied unreasonably on his compliance with the Brady Bill and the letter from the Department of Public Safety and Corrections. Under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were separately convicted of driving while intoxicated by a commissioner. On review, the court vacated the convictions and sentences because La. Rev. Stat.

Defendant argued that the seizure and sale of a vehicle that did not fall within the contraband-drug exception violated his right to property and the provision of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 4, mandating that personal effects shall never be taken. The State contended defendant's due-process rights were not violated because he pled guilty and the forfeiture of the vehicle was part of the fine for the crime. The court noted that the law at issue premised the seizure, impoundment, and sale on the requirement that defendant be convicted of at least DWI, third offense, and that the State's interest be significant, and that those interests justified depriving the defendant of his vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate challenged the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat.

The district court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 13:4751D, which prohibited a person convicted of a felony from changing his name until his sentence was satisfied. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 13:4751D was logically connected to legitimate governmental interests. Section 13:4751D was enacted for security reasons and was intended to maintain adequate identification records and to preserve the criminal history of convicted felons. The provision was necessary to maintain security, order, and administrative efficiency in penal institutions. Because &sect; 13:4751D's limitation on inmates' name changes was reasonably related to legitimate penological interests, it was not unconstitutional. Only those convicted of a felony were impacted and the time frame was limited to satisfaction of sentence. The statutory limitations did not unconstitutionally impair religious freedom.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Approximately eighteen years after receiving blood transfusion, plaintiff was diagnosed with Hepatitis C virus. Blood transfusion likely was the source of plaintiff's infection. Plaintiff filed suit against defendant hospital within one year from discovering the alleged act, omission, or neglect that caused her infection. After granting defendant's exception of prescription, trial court denied plaintiff's motion for a new trial. Plaintiff appealed, arguing that the Louisiana Medical Malpractice Act (Act), La. Rev. Stat. Ann &sect; 40:1299.41 et seq., did not apply because plaintiff's cause of action was based on strict liability. Court affirmed, holding that trial court did not err in finding that the plaintiff's claims had prescribed because &sect; 9:5628 of the Act barred recovery in all cases where medical malpractice claims were filed more than three years from the event giving rise to the claim. Moreover, plaintiff's claims that &sect; 9:5628 was unconstitutional had not been properly raised.</SPAN></P>

Third party plaintiff filed a third-party claim against the defendant race horse owner and defendant liability insurer, seeking reimbursement of attorney fees expended in defending the lawsuits against him. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff-husband was injured in an accident in 1991. He, his wife, and children filed suit. Defendants filed joint petitions for declaratory judgment that were denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendants' motions were based on language contained in the 1995 constitutional amendment to Article XII, Section 10 and the 1996 amendment to La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction from the Twenty-Seventh Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Landry (Louisiana) for two counts of attempted first degree murder, one count of conspiracy to commit first degree murder, counts involving the distribution of cocaine, and five charges of committing acts in association with a street gang.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in finding him guilty on all counts, because the evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions; that the sentences imposed were cruel, unusual, and excessive, in violation of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, and in denying his motions for mistrial based on other crimes evidence. The court held that other defendants were acting under defendant's direction when they fired at a group of people, which resulted in two life-threatening injuries. It was proved that defendant, 22 years old at the time, distributed cocaine to a 15 year-old defendant, and procured the 15 year-old defendant to distribute cocaine. Defendant received a sixty-year hard labor sentence and a fine, to run concurrently with Count IV. On review, the sentence was illegal because the fine should not have been imposed. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:981 did not mention a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions and sentences were affirmed. However, the sentence imposed for Count V (soliciting a minor to distribute cocaine) was amended to delete the imposition of a $ 100,000 fine, which was not authorized by the penalty provision for that offense, and affirmed as amended.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained defendant's exception of prescription. On appeal plaintiff asserted the doctrine of contra non valentem was applicable; defendant's actions constituted a continuing tort; and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628 was unconstitutional. The court found the third category of the doctrine of contra non valentem did not apply because plaintiff did not allege that defendant's conduct rose to the level of intentional concealment, misrepresentation, fraud or ill practices and the doctrine of continuing tort did not apply because defendant's treatment had ceased for over 12 years. The trial court erred in considering the claim of unconstitutionality because plaintiff did not allege the unconstitutionality of the statute in a petition and did not notify the attorney general as required by La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia after officers seized evidence subsequent to a search of defendant's automobile and an initial &quot;free air&quot; search by a police canine unit. Defendant pleaded guilty after trial court refused to suppress evidence officers obtained. On appeal, defendant argued the officers' search was unconstitutional. Applying analogous caselaw, court held police officers had probable cause to search the vehicle based on the alert from the canine unit. Court also held canine unit's &quot;free air&quot; search was not considered a &quot;search&quot; subject to constitutional restraints. Thus, court held evidence was properly allowable.</SPAN></P>

The police officers that stopped and frisked defendant were justified in their actions under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 215.1. They witnessed behavior consistent with a drug transaction and saw defendant motion toward his sock after defendant saw the officers. Defendant then attempted to flee. The discovery of marijuana during the frisk was justified under the plain feel warrant exception because it was obvious from the feel to the trained narcotics officer.

Const. art. V, &sect; 16; [3]-The City Council did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in approving the project as it conducted a thorough analysis and found that the project was rational and within the discretion of the Historic District Landmarks Commission and Central Business District Historic District Landmarks Commission; [4]-The project did not result in unconstitutional spot zoning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The State's decision to eliminate title examinations in administering its Road Home assistance program for hurricane relief to homeowners was a policy judgment grounded in social and economic policy to expedite assistance to homeowners; therefore, the State was entitled to immunity under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2798.1 in a property owner's negligence claim; [2]-A Declaration of Covenants required by the State's Road Home program affected the true owner's legal rights in the property because it restricted his right to use and enjoy the property; however, because the owner failed to prove a diminution of value of the property, he could not recover for an unconstitutional taking in violation of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
