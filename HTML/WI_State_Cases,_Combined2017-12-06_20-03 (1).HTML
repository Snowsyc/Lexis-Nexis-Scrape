Stat. &sect; 940.32(2) (2011-12), because the State presented evidence of four separate acts collectively satisfying the definition of a &quot;course of conduct&quot; directed at the social worker and defendant was on notice that faxing additional allegations about the social worker to her place of employment would cause her to suffer serious emotional distress.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 990.001(6) (2011-2012); [3]-Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.83(2)(am) was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided fair notice that individuals were prohibited from leasing closed MFL property for recreational purposes; [4]-The manager of the property rather than its owner was properly cited for leasing the land because the prohibition applied to any &quot;person&quot; and did not require that the owner be cited.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 990.01(12) was consistent with the case, which did not concern the grant of a fee or an easement; [3]-The Village residents had not proved that &sect; 82.31(2)(a) was unconstitutional, given that they relied on Minnesota decisions that were not helpful to the court's analysis and they did not further develop their contention.</SPAN></P>

And, even assuming ambiguity in the testimony on that definitional point, that would not have been the result of a lack of clear standards in the statute.

The LLC thus was the real party in interest; [2]-Pursuant to Wis.

The trial court granted the city's request for an injunction and ordered him to move.

The appellate court found that the hearing officer's determination that the inmate was not credible regarding his violation of Wis. Admin.

Stat. ch. 770 (2009-10), did not violate the marriage amendment, Wis. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 13, was proper because the partnership law did not create a legal status that was substantially similar to that of marriage. There was little reason to think that voters believed that the marriage amendment language would prohibit domestic partnerships. The partnerships were substantially different than marriages because domestic partnerships carried with them substantially fewer rights and obligations than those enjoyed by and imposed on married couples.</SPAN></P>

He moved for dismissal on the grounds that the statute is unconstitutional and did not contest that he had driven in excess of the speed limit. The court denied his motion and found him guilty at a court trial. On appeal, his main argument was that the speeding statute was unconstitutional as applied to him as, according to his religion, he is a &quot;man&quot; and not a &quot;person.&quot; The appellate court found that his claim had to be rejected because he, as a &quot;man&quot; also met the definition of the meaning of a &quot;person.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The trial court then directed a verdict for the state as to those two allegations. The appellate court found the rules of civil procedure applied to a termination of parental rights hearing and that the trial court pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.14(4) (2010) could direct a verdict in such a case at the close of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the post-arrest affidavit filed by the arresting police officer contained materially false statements and did not establish the existence of probable cause for defendant's arrest; and defendant's warrantless arrest violated his constitutional right to privacy in a law school library of a private institution. The court disagreed with defendant's arguments and upheld the decision. Unlike in a private home, a warrantless arrest was permitted in a public place when the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest the individual. Although the law school library where defendant was arrested was part of a private institution, it was open to the general public and was not a place in which defendant had any reasonable expectation of privacy. Consequently, defendant's constitutional rights were not violated. The arresting officer had a video of a man matching defendant's description robbing a bank and an acquaintance of defendant's had identified him as the man in the video. The video coupled with the identification was enough evidence to establish probable cause that defendant committed a crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant store owner sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which awarded it a partial judgment in its action against respondent, the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District. The owner had set forth the action for damages sustained to its building by alleging that the District's negligent maintenance and operation of a deep tunnel permitted groundwater to excessively seep into the tunnel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District cross-appealed. The store owner alleged that the District's negligent maintenance and operation of the tunnel, which was a 19 mile; 32 foot diameter; sewage and stormwater tunnel that ran 300 feet below the downtown area, permitted groundwater in the downtown area to excessively seep into the tunnel. The owner claimed that this dewatered the ground underneath its building and as a result, the water table in the area of the building dropped and the timber piles upon which the building was founded began to rot and shift due to exposure to air and soil settlement. The owner only prevailed on its negligence claim at trial. The jury found that the owner was 30 percent contributorily negligent. With respect to a nuisance claim, the jury concluded that although the District interfered with the owner's use and enjoyment of its building but that the owner did not suffer significant harm. The court partially overruled the decision and concluded that the trial court improperly exercised its discretion and incorrectly construed Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80 (2009-10) to permit injunctive relief that would, in effect, render the damage cap set forth in Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80(3) superfluous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the trial court's order refusing to reverse the jury's nuisance finding that the owner did not suffer significant harm and its order granting the owner injunctive relief, but the remainder of the trial court's decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only issue on appeal was whether the circuit court erred in counting Arizona and California drunk-driving matters as prior convictions under the Wisconsin statutes. Defendant argued that the evidence was not sufficient to find that she had &quot;convictions&quot; as that word was defined by Wis. Stat. &sect; 340.01(9r) and that the prosecutor improperly testified when he explained what he asserted the documents meant. Defendant also argued that she did not have the requisite constitutional protections in connection with the Arizona and California matters. Thus, she asserted that those matters could not be counted to enhance her penalties for driving drunk in Wisconsin. The court upheld the decision. With regard to the Arizona matter, by not appearing in court on the specified date as she was directed, defendant did not comply with the law under Wis. Stat. &sect; 340.01(9r). With regard to the California case, even putting aside the clear circumstantial evidence that the officer would not have let her go if she did not promise to appear when and where she was ordered, defendant clearly violated or failed to comply with the law when she repeatedly did not appear as required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of felony murder, armed robbery, armed burglary, and false imprisonment, all as a party to the crime.  Defendant argued on appeal that he was entitled to a new trial because the trial court failed to provide the jury with a not guilty verdict form for the lesser-included offense of felony murder. He contended that the alleged error constituted structural error. The appellate court found that the omission was subject to a harmless error analysis and that the error in the context of the trial and the particular facts presented was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 941.29(2), 941.23 (2007-08).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements he made to police on the basis that an officer asked him questions likely to elicit incriminating responses while he was in police custody without giving him his Miranda warnings; the conversation between him and police was an interrogation for Miranda purposes even if defendant initiated it; and the resulting error was not harmless. Defendant additionally argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the handgun found in his car shortly after his arrest because it resulted from an unconstitutional, warrantless search. The court upheld the decision. The court concluded that defendant was not interrogated for Miranda purposes and that the admission of his statements at trial was therefore proper as a matter of law. It was clear that the police comments to defendant at issue were not designed to elicit incriminating testimony but were directed instead at preventing a false confession. Additionally, there was nothing in the record to indicate that the police had any specific knowledge of defendant or of any unusual susceptibility to questioning he might have had.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 980.02 (2003-04) and denied his petition for discharge from commitment. Respondent, the State of Wisconsin, opposed the inmate's action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's petition was denied without a hearing. The trial court found that the inmate was committed upon a diagnosed mental disorder of pedophilia and not anti-social personality disorder; the inmate's continued mental disorder of pedophilia predisposed him to engage in sexually violent acts; the trial record amply supported a conclusion that he posed a risk of committing future acts of sexual violence; and that the facility where he would be placed was a secure facility, not community placement, and the community members with whom the inmate resided were other inmates, not the community at large. The trial court found that the inmate likely controlled his behavior at the facility because he was awaiting revocation proceedings. The court upheld the decision and found that the inmate had not presented sufficient facts to have been granted a full evidentiary hearing or that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 980.09 and 980.10 (2003-04) were unconstitutional as the inmate had alleged. The court found that Wis. Stat. ch. 980 was not an extension of the inmate's criminal conviction.

The opponents had set forth the action by contesting an ordinance providing paid sick leave for employees within a city that was enacted pursuant to the direct legislation statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 9.20 (2009-10).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court concluded that the ballot statement did not comply with Wis. Stat. &sect; 9.20(6) (2009-10) and that certain provisions in the ordinance were not rationally related to the city's police powers. The court overruled. the decision. The ordinance provided that paid sick leave was to be accrued at a minimum rate of one hour for every 30 hours worked up to at least 72 hours in a year except that in small businesses of fewer than ten employees the required annual amount was 40 hours. After 90 days of employment, employees could begin to use their accrued sick leave and could thereafter use it as it accrued. Although some employers, both in that hearing and in affidavits presented by the opponents in the trial court, opposed the ordinance because of the cost to them, a evidentiary report took into account not only the additional expense to employers of paid sick leave under the ordinance but the financial savings to employers as well. The opponents had not pointed to any factual materials that disputed the report and did not show that it was unreasonable to conclude that providing paid sick leave as required by the ordinance would be an overall financial benefit to the city.</SPAN></P>

Thus, defendant did not need to have his right to remain silent recited to him. Once the officers determined for their own safety that the apartment was safe, defendant was not handcuffed or restrained in any way. The police him to come with them to talk, and he agreed to do so. Nothing changed when the officers and defendant went back to the apartment to reenact the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Sawyer County (Wisconsin), convicting him of possession of marijuana, second and subsequent offense; possession of drug paraphernalia; and operating while intoxicated, second offense. Defendant argued the circuit court erroneously denied his pretrial suppression motion. He further contended that it was unconstitutional to criminalize marijuana possession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving a truck, and a deputy stopped him for apparent speeding and a loud exhaust. During the stop, the deputy found marijuana and a brass smoking pipe on defendant's person. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's challenge to the factual findings underlying the circuit court's decision to deny his suppression motion. In the absence of transcripts, his argument failed. The court next held that defendant failed to demonstrate he had a sincerely held religious belief that was burdened by the application of the state law criminalizing marijuana possession. Thus, his First Amendment argument failed. The court declined to address his Eighth Amendment argument and his contention that marijuana was unconstitutional due to overwhelming popularity of use. Neither claim was adequately developed. Finally, the court rejected defendant's argument that he should have been charged with ordinance violations rather than statutory criminal violations. Defendant failed to make a prima facie showing of discriminatory prosecution such that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. He faulted his trial counsel for failing to investigate or develop the defense that he was not guilty because he lacked intent to commit a crime. Defendant believed that such investigation could have suggested a strong defense. The court upheld the decision. It held that intent could be inferred from defendant's conduct including his words and gestures taken in the context of the circumstances. Defendant's wife testified that defendant grabbed a telephone, smashed it across her face, knelt on top of her, and used the telephone to hit her repeatedly in the head until she nearly lost consciousness. She testified that she required 14 stitches to repair a laceration over her eye and an additional 17 staples to close the gashes in the back of her head. The court held that the jury reasonably inferred from defendant's conduct and admissions that he intended to cause substantial harm, and defendant did not explain what an investigation would have uncovered that would have undermined his own inculpatory testimony and furthered a theory that he did not intend to harm his wife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel did not investigate the circumstances of a vehicle stop and then file a motion to suppress.

In the case of a codefendant, the court of appeals addressed a claim that the vehicle stop was unconstitutional and held that there was a legally permissible basis for the stop.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Shawano County (Wisconsin), which upheld her conviction for violating a municipal ordinance that prohibited refusal to permit inspection of premises that were subject to a liquor license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the agent for a liquor license at a hotel. On the evening at issue, a social club had rented the hotel for a private party, and the hotel and bar were closed to the public. City police officers arrived at the hotel to conduct a compliance check to ensure the hotel bar was operating within the parameters of its liquor license. When an officer asked defendant if he was going to get access to the bar for a premises check, she replied that she had nothing to do with the bar. Defendant was cited for violating Shawano, Wis., Code &sect; 7.01(8) (2010). A municipal court found her guilty of the violation. The trial court upheld the judgment of conviction. On appeal, the court agreed that defendant clearly denied the officers access. As the agent for the liquor license, defendant had full authority and control of the premises under Wis. Stat. &sect; 125.04(6)(a)2 (2009-10). She knew the officers wanted to enter the hotel to perform a compliance check, and, as the person with full authority and control, she did not do anything to let them inside. Further, defendant's statement of facts contained several brazen assertions that were completely unsupported by the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court sanctioned defense counsel $ 200.</SPAN></P>
