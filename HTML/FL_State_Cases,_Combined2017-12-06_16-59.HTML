<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Martin County (Florida) of lewd and lascivious battery. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court improperly assessed points on the sentencing guideline scoresheet for victim injury based on a finding of sexual penetration. At trial, a deputy testified that he observed defendant and the victim having sex, but stated that he did not actually see defendant penetrate the victim. Defendant denied engaging in intercourse; the victim said she was intoxicated at the time and could not recall, but that she strongly doubted that intercourse occurred. The jury merely returned a guilty verdict and was not asked to make a specific finding of penetration. Defendant claimed that the trial court's finding violated due process because penetration was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court held that the trial court's finding was not used to depart from the maximum sentence allowed by law of 15 years. Instead, it was a sentencing factor used by the trial court in imposing a sentence--101.7 months--that fell within the range allowed by statute. Therefore only a preponderance of the evidence was required to support the finding, and the deputy's testimony was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Duval County, Florida, dismissed three of four counts of an information against defendant, which charged him with the unlawful practice of law. From this order, the State of Florida appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Florida challenged dismissal of charges within its complaint against defendant, contending that Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 15 did not preclude the legislature from criminalizing the unlicensed practice of law by a disbarred attorney, and thus Fla. Stat. ch. 454.31 was not unconstitutional. The appeals court agreed. The statute did not violate the exclusive power granted to the judicial branch to regulate the Bar. Under the police power, the legislature could enact penal legislation that affected the legal profession, just as it could with other occupations and professions. It thus had the constitutional authority to enact legislation making it a crime for a disbarred person to practice law or hold himself or herself out as an attorney. The language in Fla. R. Bar 3-7.14 was directed to the incongruous reference to circuit courts within the statute, and the rules of discipline only superceded the statutory regulations to the extent the latter conflicted with the former.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the circuit court was reversed and the case was remanded for reinstatement of counts two, three and four of the State's information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to trafficking in cocaine, and was sentenced as a habitual felony offender. The Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County, Florida, deleted the habitual felony offender portion of his sentence, but denied his motion to correct illegal sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court signed a 1995 sentencing guidelines scoresheet before it imposed a nine year sentence imposed. However, the record did not show whether the trial court based the sentence on the 1995 scoresheet. The trial court accepted defendant's argument that he should have been sentenced under the guidelines and not as a habitual felony offender, based on Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)1.a (1996 Supp.), and in its order on appeal, it deleted that portion of defendant's sentence that classified him as a habitual felony offender. However, it summarily denying defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence, and left the nine year sentence in place, apparently because it deemed the sentence legal because it fell within the 1994 scoresheet it recalculated. The appellate court held that upon lifting habitual felony offender designation, the trial court should have resentenced defendant under the 1994 sentencing guidelines. The trial court also erred in assessing the points for delivery of a counterfeit substance. The error in the scoresheet was not harmless, as the top of the corrected range was slightly less than the sentence defendant received.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the inmate filed an affidavit containing the information required by ch. 57.085(2), he did not provide a list of litigation he had been involved in during the preceding five years as required by ch. 57.085(7).

Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the inmate's request for waiver of prepayment of costs and fees for failure to comply with the prior litigation listing requirement, nor did it err in dismissing the suit for failure to pay the filing fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees city and county sought declaratory judgments in the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) concerning enforcement by appellant Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services of a citrus canker eradication program. The trial court issued preliminary injunctions finding Fla. Stat. ch. 581.031(15)(a) (2000) unconstitutional in part. The department appealed and the city and the county cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and the county claimed that ch. 581.031(15)(a) was unconstitutional because it did not require the department to obtain a search warrant prior to conducting inspections. The trial court found the statute unconstitutional in that it did not require a warrant for non-consensual searches, but added that it was self-evident that probable cause would exist for warrants with respect to citrus canker eradication efforts. The city and the county cross-appealed concerning the determination as to probable cause. The appellate court held that the city and the county lacked standing to challenge the statute. State officers and agencies could not challenge the validity of legislation affecting their duties, and the fact that the county and the city might face liability because the county was required to assist the department in enforcement and might call upon the city for police assistance did not establish standing. Also, neither the county nor the city could assert Fourth Amendment rights of individual property owners. The cross-appeal was found to be moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city passed an ordinance implementing a parking tax previously enacted by the legislature. Appellant taxpayers filed suit challenging the validity of the ordinance. The trial court granted appellee summary judgment, holding ordinance was validly enacted and upholding the constitutionality of the parking tax statute. Appellants challenged the ruling. The court initially noted under Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 1(a), 9(a), a municipality could not impose any non-ad valorem tax, such as a parking tax, except as authorized by general law. The court observed in order to be constitutional, the statute was required to be a general law as opposed to a special law. The court held a general law was one that operated uniformly among a class of entities while a special law related to particular entities. The court concluded the ordinance at issue was a special law because it did not operate uniformly among all cities. The court reversed, holding a statute which constituted a special law could not impose a non-ad valorem tax and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee municipalities and residents sued appellants Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and its commissioner in the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County, Florida, for declaratory and injunctive relief and for inverse condemnation. The trial court entered an injunction, and the department and commissioner appealed. The appellate court's opinion was substituted on motion for clarification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipalities and residents challenged the validity of a citrus canker eradication program, claiming that the department's expedited procedure for issuing immediate final orders (IFOs) for the destruction of citrus trees amounted to an unconstitutional seizure of property. The appellate court found that the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the claim for injunctive and declaratory relief for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Any challenge to IFOs issued to the residents should have been brought before the appellate court, not the trial court, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 120.68 (2000). Challenges claiming the department failed to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 120 (2000), should have been brought before the Division of Administrative Hearings. The municipalities and residents did not demonstrate that administrative remedies were inadequate or that the department lacked colorable statutory authority for its actions, and there was no claim that the statutes or rules in question were facially unconstitutional. Therefore, none of the exceptions to the exhaustion requirement applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded with directions to vacate the injunction and dismiss the claim for injunctive and declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(1) (1993), which required that virtually every automobile insurance policy issued in Florida to provide personal injury protection (PIP) for various specified individuals, including, in ch. 627.736(1)(d), &quot;other persons struck by such motor vehicle,&quot; such as the injured party, placed no residency restriction on the receipt of PIP benefits. The residency requirement in Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(4)(d)(4) (1993) was designed to preserve the no-fault statute's constitutionality and had to be read narrowly as a pure residency requirement and not a requirement including elements of domicile or citizenship. The legislature did not intend the receipt of PIP benefits and the corollary application of the no-fault insurance threshold to be dependent upon the injured party's right to vote or his domicile or citizenship in Florida. Nothing in the statute suggested the legislature intended to deny PIP benefits to Florida's hospitals and doctors when they treated undocumented residents, such as the injured party, injured by a Florida car.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Seventeenth Judicial Circuit Court, Broward County (Florida), found claimants' club was not a private club and denied injunctive and declaratory judgment relief against enforcement of state statutes declaring it unlawful to own or operate a place for the purpose of providing prostitution, assignation, or lewdness, and making it unlawful for any person to offer, commit, or engage in prostitution, assignation, or lewdness. Claimants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant club owner, dancer, and club member filed suit after claimant club owner was arrested for violating one state statute and its dancers were arrested for violating another statute. The first statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 796.07(2)(a)(1999), declared it unlawful for any person to own or operate a place for the purpose of providing prostitution, assignation, or lewdness and was used to arrest claimant club owner. The second statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 796.07(2)(e)(1999), made it unlawful for any person to offer, commit, or engage in prostitution, assignation, or lewdness and was used to arrest claimant dancer. After the trial court ruled the club was not private and denied the requested injunctive and declaratory relief, the appellate court found substantial, competent evidence supported the trial court's finding. It also found respondent municipality was not equitably estopped from refusing to recognize the club as private even though it issued a license designating the club as private since the claimants had not relied on the designation. It also found the statutes were not facially unconstitutional for not imposing a scienter requirement and for imposing strict liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Substantial, competent evidence supported trial court's finding that claimant's club was not a private club. Accordingly, respondents were not violating claimants' First Amendment rights by enforcing state statutes at issue and respondents were not estopped to enforce those statutes. Also, the statutes were not facially unconstitutional for not imposing a scienter requirement and for imposing strict liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Contractor alleged that the county had illegally required state-certified contractors to pay a forbidden registration fee, as well as the allowable fees for an occupational license and building permits, as a prerequisite to engaging in contracting in the county. The contractor also sought a refund on behalf of itself and others for the previously paid illegal fees. The county claimed that it was protected by its sovereign immunity from refunding any fees if they were illegal. On appeal, the court found that the registration fee violated the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 489.113(4)(a) (1994). Therefore, trial court should have enjoined the county from charging the forbidden additional fee. Further, once the illegality of the registration fee was established, the county was required to refund the fees, as the doctrine of sovereign immunity was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Fla. Stat. ch. 284.30 (1999), citizens were required to provide notice to the state insurance department that they claimed attorney's fees in their suit against health department. Health department's failure to raise the issue until after judgment did not waive the statute's requirements, since citizens did not initially allege that all conditions precedent to their attorney's fees claim had been satisfied. Health department was, as a result, not required to raise lack of statutory notice in its answer. Chapter 284.30 was not unconstitutional for not specifying when the required notice was to be provided, since it was facially apparent notice was to be given at the action's commencement. The statute was related to a legitimate governmental purpose of allowing the agency responsible for paying citizens' attorney's fee claim to participate in the lawsuit. Whether that purpose could be more easily accomplished in another manner was irrelevant to the statute's constitutionality. The statute put all persons suing the state on the same footing, and, thus, did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance company challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida), arguing the trial court erred by refusing to declare appellees' injury claims were excluded from coverage under an automobile liability policy it issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's insured led police on an automobile chase that resulted in her being charged with eluding a law enforcement officer, reckless driving, and running a stop sign. During the episode, appellant's insured was involved in two motor vehicle accidents with appellees. Appellees asserted claims under the bodily injury liability portion of the insured's automobile insurance policy. In response, appellant sued for a declaratory judgment, arguing the claims were not covered by virtue of a policy exclusion for intentional acts. The trial court denied the requested relief and appellant challenged the ruling, arguing the criminal episode was an intentional act excluded by the policy. The court held an insurance policy procured to comply with the financial responsibility law was an insurance policy for the benefit of the public; therefore, it could not contain exclusions which destroyed the effectiveness of the policy as to any substantial segment of that public. The court affirmed, holding that although the insured was intentionally fleeing from police when the accidents occurred, there was no evidence she intentionally drove her vehicle into appellees' vehicles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed, because appellant's expansive intentional acts exclusion provision, if strictly applied, would have contravened the public policy behind the financial responsibility laws. Further, there was no evidence indicating its insured intentionally drove her vehicle into appellees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only applicable exceptions to defendant's obligation to file his post-conviction relief motion within two years required newly discovered facts unknown to him, or claims based on a constitutional right not established within the two-year time period, which applied retroactively. The decision finding the sentencing guidelines applied to defendant unconstitutional was not a newly discovered fact. A constitutional right was not retroactive unless the change (1) emanated from the supreme court or the United States Supreme Court; (2) was constitutional; and (3) was a development of fundamental significance. Changes of law of fundamental significance either removed authority from the State, or were of a magnitude to require retroactive application under the test considering (1) the purpose to be served by the new rule; (2) the extent of reliance on the old rule; and (3) the effect retroactive application would have on the administration of justice. The State was not divested of any powers. The sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional because they were part of legislation combining unrelated civil and criminal laws, in violation of the constitution's single-subject requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed because the purpose served by the decision finding sentencing guidelines applied to defendant unconstitutional, the extent of reliance on those guidelines, and the effect retroactive application would have on the administration of justice, did not warrant that decision's retroactive application. Two questions were certified to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Columbia County, Florida, convicting him of knowingly committing a lewd or lascivious act in the presence of a child under age 16 after denying his motion to dismiss the charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with knowingly committing a lewd or lascivious act in the presence of a child under the age of 16. Appellant was charged with violating this law by telling a child that he desired to engage her in oral sex, using language which described this in a graphic manner. In his motion to dismiss, appellant alleged the child was visiting in his home and lying on his couch when he addressed her with the specified remarks expressing his sexual desire. Appellant further indicated that when the child expressed confusion appellant explained his intent with specific language which was even more sexually graphic. Noting that he made no motion toward the child and did not hinder her when she got up and left, appellant asserted his conduct consisted merely of verbal statements within the privacy of his own home and that these undisputed facts did not establish a prima facie violation of the applicable statute. The court found the motion to dismiss was properly denied, as there was no question appellant understood he was acting in a lewd or lascivious manner when he uttered his sexually offensive remarks to the child. Mere verbal conduct was sufficient under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal order was affirmed. The court determined that the factual allegations by the State were sufficient to bring appellant's conduct with child under the age of 16 within the statutory proscription against the commission of a lewd or lascivious act. It was no matter that appellant's conduct consisted merely of verbal statements unaccompanied by other physical action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alleged that he was entitled to be resentenced pursuant to Heggs. Appellant also claimed that the habitual felony offender sentences for his life felony convictions were illegal because they were imposed pursuant to an unconstitutional version of Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1995), which authorized life felonies to be subjected to habitual felony offender enhancement. As to appellant's first claim, the trial court properly denied Heggs relief because appellant was not sentenced under the guidelines, but rather as a habitual felony offender, and therefore, was not entitled to Heggs resentencing. The trial court, however, failed to address appellant's allegation that he was not subject to habitualization on convictions for life felonies. If appellant was, in fact, sentenced as a habitual felony offender for life felonies that occurred prior to May 24, 1997, then he was entitled to be resentenced. The appellate court reversed and remanded as to that claim. On remand, the trial court should reconsider the sentences in accordance with the valid laws in effect at the time of appellant's offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee sought declaratory judgment and an injunction in the 15th Judicial Circuit Court, Palm Beach County (Florida), challenging the constitutionality of Palm Beach County, Fla., Ordinance No. 99-18 (1999), requiring adult entertainment performers to obtain identification cards. The trial court ruled in appellee's favor, and appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's ordinance required adult entertainment performers to provide names and aliases, including stage names, along with residence addresses and telephone numbers. Appellee objected this information would be available to members of the public, who might wish to harass her, under the Florida Public Records Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 119 (1999). Before appellee's right to privacy under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, which was broader than the federal privacy right, attached, she had to demonstrate a reasonable expectation of privacy. While appellee's right to privacy protected her from governmental intrusion, it did not protect her from public intrusion, which was the gravamen of her complaint. Further, her right to privacy was expressly subservient to the public records act. While certain personal information for certain types of occupations was exempted from public disclosure by Fla. Stat. ch. 119.07(3)(i) (1999), adult entertainment performers were not one of the exempted occupations. Appellee, therefore, had no legitimate expectation of privacy from governmental intrusion and, thus, no right to privacy concerning the information required to obtain an identification card attached.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed because appellee had no legitimate expectation of privacy from governmental intrusion concerning the information she was required to submit to obtain an identification card, allowing her to work as an adult entertainment performer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant grandmother petitioned to adopt her grandchild in Hillsborough County, Florida. Appellee potential adoptive parents petitioned to adopt the same child in the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida). Appellant filed a motion to intervene in the Duval County proceeding and to consolidate that case with the Hillsborough County case. The trial court denied the motions to intervene and to consolidate. Appellant challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's unwed daughter had lived with appellant for six months before the daughter gave birth. The biological parents executed valid waivers of right to counsel, affidavits of birthparents, and consents for adoption. The grandchild did not live with appellant at any time subsequent to her birth. Appellant contended that she was a proper party to the adoption proceeding appellees initiated as she had legal rights that the trial court erred in not letting her intervene to protect. The appellate court found that the trial court had no authority to consolidate the case below with the case pending in the other circuit. Further, appellant could not intervene because she had no interest to assert in the adoption. She had no statutory preference under Fla. Stat. ch. 63.0425(1) (1999), by virtue of her daughter's living with her for six months before her grandchild's birth. Also, she had no constitutional liberty interests as a parent of an underage mother to give her a right to intervene in the adoption proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed as appellant had no interest to assert in the adoption proceeding commenced by appellees and the trial court did not have the authority to consolidate the two actions from different circuits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought rehearing from the court's prior opinion and decision. The court granted the same.

The appellate court agreed and reversed the sentence and remanded on the issue. The conviction was otherwise affirmed, as the Florida Supreme Court approved a decision holding that the Act was not unconstitutional on its face as violative of separation of powers principles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an appeal from the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida), defendant sought a rehearing, rehearing en banc, and question certification. The State moved for clarification. The court readopted its original opinion. Defendant questioned the requirement to initially challenge sentencing guidelines in the trial court and the effect of amendments of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b) on sentencing appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted the appellate court's original opinion required him to perform a useless act by raising his challenge to the sentencing guidelines first in the trial court. Given the fact defendant's issue was pending before the supreme court, filing his motion in the trial court would not have been useless if that court ultimately overruled, as it did, the appellate court's prior decision on the issue. Amendments to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b) limited appellate review of unpreserved sentencing errors where defendants had the procedural mechanism in those amendments available to them. Questions involving these two issues were certified to the supreme court as being of great public importance, in place of the question proposed by defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court readopted its original opinion, found that opinion did not require defendant to perform a useless act by challenging sentencing guidelines first in the trial court, and that rule amendments limited appellate review of unpreserved sentencing errors, and certified two questions related to these issues to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

The court held the Florida Supreme Court previously held 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 182 was unconstitutional and thus rendered the unlawful possession of a firearm charge by a violent career criminal a non-existent crime. The trial court reversed the conviction, but remanded the matter for a new trial on the lesser offense of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed, because the statute proscribing unlawful possession of a firearm charge by a violent career criminal was earlier found unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court scored attempted second degree murder with a firearm as a Level 8 offense rather than a Level 7 offense.

Stat. ch. 921.0012 (Supp. 1994), the offense should have been scored as an unranked offense under Fla. Stat. ch. 921.0013 (1993). He claimed that the firearm enhancement statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.087(1)(b), made attempted second degree murder with a firearm an unlisted crime for purposes of determining the applicable offense severity ranking. The appellate court found that attempted second degree murder with a firearm was a first degree felony punishable as a Level 8 offense.  Fla. Stat. ch. 777.04(4)(a) (1993) and Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.702(d)(6) required that attempted second degree murder with a firearm be scored as a Level 8 offense, two levels below the Level 10 offense severity ranking for second degree murder.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 948.03(5)(a)(7) (1999) on his sentence for attempted sexual battery as unconstitutional and arguing it provided no hearing or notice about what constituted deviant behavior pattern.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to attempted sexual battery while in a position of familial or custodial authority and was sentenced to seven years of incarceration, followed by five years of probation. Appellant reserved the right to challenge the constitutionality of several of the sex-offender probationary conditions set out in Fla. Stat. chs. 948.03(5)(a), (b) (1999) that were imposed. He argued the prohibition of Fla. Stat. ch. 948.03(5)(a)(7) (1999) from his viewing or owning obscene, pornographic, or sexually stimulating visual or auditory material relevant to his deviant behavior pattern was unconstitutionally vague. Specifically, he argued the condition violated due process because it did not provide notice of what was obscene and provided no hearing or notice about what constituted a deviant behavior pattern. The court initially noted the United States Supreme Court had defined obscene material. The court affirmed, holding state statutes regarding his crime provided adequate notice of what constituted deviant sexual behavior and that he would be afforded a revocation hearing should he be charged with violating the condition of his probation.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 828.12(2) (1997), defendant claimed the statute was unconstitutional because it did not include a specific intent element. The appellate court found the statute required only general intent on the part of defendant, and did not require that defendant commit an act intending to cause cruelty to an animal. However, the lack of a specific intent element did not render the statute facially unconstitutional as it was within the power of the Florida Legislature to declare the conduct criminal without requiring specific criminal intent to be an element of the crime. The statute was therefore constitutional even though it lacked a specific intent element.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the final judgment after pleading no contest to the sale of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a convenience business, and possession with intent to sell. Upon such plea, he reserved his right to appeal the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss. He contended Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;893.13 (1)(e) was unconstitutionally vague in its creation of a 1,000 foot drug-free zone around convenience businesses. The point of departure for his argument was that the legislature chose not to use the commonly understood term, &quot;convenience store&quot;, instead choosing the term &quot;convenience business,&quot; and has defined that term only by reference to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 812.171 (1999). The court of appeals held that the problem was one of construction, not constitutionality. The exceptions listed in section 812.171 were defenses. Thus it was up to appellant to raise them, if they applied. The court, in finding appellant did not specifically allege any defense, rejected his argument and held the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owner argued in substance that the statute was unconstitutional because it did not contain sufficient procedural safeguards to assure that the owner and other interested persons were given notice of the seizure and an opportunity to be heard. The State should have obtained an ex-parte preliminary hearing for the court to determine whether there was probable cause to maintain the forfeiture action. Upon the ex parte seizure of the fishing boat, the State should have notified all interested parties that it had taken the property in a forfeiture action and that they had the right to request a post-seizure adversarial preliminary hearing. Thus the defendant owner should have been given notice immediately. Because the State in no way complied with the required procedures in seizing the vessel, the dismissal of the forfeiture action was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The appellate court disagreed that the statute was unconstitutional from a due process standpoint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Public-records requests were made of defendant. Defendant delayed and then limited the review of the records. Finally, defendant terminated the review of the records, claiming they had not been properly redacted.

Stat. ch. 119.07(1)(a) (Supp. 1998) was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. The appellate court found the trial court erred because the evidence was sufficient to prove a violation of the statute, and the application of the statute to defendant was constitutional. The statute provided defendant with fair warning that her dilatory responses to the record requests did not comport with the statute's requirement that she provide reasonable access to public records in her custody. Further the statute was properly applied to defendant as Fla. Stat. chs. 119.02, 119.10(2) (1997) authorized a conviction for violating the statute only if defendant was found to have committed such violation knowingly, or willfully and knowingly.

He argued that under &sect; 812.171, only the business owner knew whether or not his business was a &quot;convenience business,&quot; and as the statute did not enable the public to discern which businesses came within the definition, it was void for vagueness. The appellate court disagreed.

Stat. ch. 775.084 (1989) were unconstitutional; therefore, aggravated battery was not a qualifying offense at the time he committed the sexual batteries. The court went on to reverse, holding a prior conviction for throwing a deadly missile into a vehicle was not one of the offenses that could be used to qualify appellant as a habitual violent felony offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed, because appellant's previous conviction for aggravated battery and throwing a deadly missile into a vehicle were not offenses that could have properly been used to qualify him as a habitual violent felony offender. Therefore, the trial court erred in sentencing appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his motion, appellant contended that he was sentenced under an unconstitutional version of the 1995 sentencing guidelines. He also alleged that his primary offense at conviction, trafficking in more than 14 grams of amphetamine but less than 28 grams, was improperly scored as a level 8 rather than a level 7 offense. When the trial court denied appellant's motion, it found that appellant was not prejudiced because the 1994 sentencing guidelines scoresheet showed the same sentencing range as the 1995 guidelines scoresheet. However, because the trial court failed to address appellant's claim that the offense was improperly scored, the instant court remanded the matter to the trial court to address that claim, as the claim was cognizable from the face of the scoresheet and appeared to have merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed insofar as it found that appellant was not prejudiced by being sentenced under 1995 sentencing guidelines.

Stat. ch. 193.075, under which the mobile homes were subject to taxation as real property. Appellants challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Volusia County (Florida), which found the statute constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged statute exempted from ad valorem taxes mobile homes affixed to leased property. Appellants contended that subjecting a mobile home to ad valorem taxation when the owner of the home also owned the real property to which it was permanently affixed, while exempting mobile homes affixed to leased real property from such taxes, violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1(b). The appellate court agreed with the trial court, finding the challenged statute to be constitutional.  Fla. Stat. ch. 193.075 (1996) was rationally related to a valid governmental purpose and reasonably designed to achieve that purpose. It was reasonable for the legislature to conclude that a mobile home was more akin to a permanent structure when the home owner also owned the underlying land. The legislative definition of &quot;mobile home&quot; was not invalid under Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed; the appellate court concluded the legislature had a valid reason to classify mobile homes as real property when there existed a commonality of ownership with the underlying real property, and to exclude mobile homes affixed to leased land from ad valorem taxes.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 790.065(12) (Supp. 1998). The Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida) dismissed the charge after finding that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) had failed to properly promulgate the form required by Fla. Stat. ch. 790.065(1)(a) (Supp. 1998). The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charge against defendant was based on his allegedly false answer to a question on a United States Treasury Department, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) form concerning whether he had ever been convicted of a felony. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the charge against defendant because the State could not constitutionally prosecute the defendant pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 790.065(12) under the facts of the case. Despite the plain language of the statute, the ATF form adopted by the FDLE asked a series of questions about the potential buyer's background in addition to the identifying information authorized by the statute. Any prosecution of a potential buyer based on allegedly false answers to these additional questions was unconstitutional for two reasons: (1) any such prosecution violated the separation of powers doctrine; (2) any prosecution for allegedly false answers to these additional questions violated the due process clause of the Florida Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to fondling a child under 16. He was not advised a petition for his civil commitment could be filed, under Fla. Stat. chs. 394.910-.931 (2000), and he was advised by counsel he would be released from custody shortly after his plea. His motion for postconviction relief, in the Circuit Court for Pasco County (Florida) was summarily denied, and he sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant's guilty plea and resulting conviction triggered a review of his case to determine if his civil commitment, under the Jimmy Ryce Civil Commitment for Sexually Violent Predators' Treatment and Care Act, Fla. Stat. chs. 394.910-.931 (2000), would be sought, commitment was not an automatic result of his plea. It was, therefore, a collateral consequence of the plea, and defendant's lack of notice of it did not render his guilty plea invalid. However, affirmative misadvice regarding even a collateral consequence of a guilty plea formed a basis for withdrawing the plea. Defense counsel's advice that defendant would be released from custody shortly after entering it was such affirmative misadvice, when defendant remained in custody. The possibility that defense counsel's meaning was that defendant would be released from the custody of the Department of Corrections was of no significance when defendant's custody was simply transferred from the Department of Corrections to the Department of Children and Families, to be held in secure detention pending determination of a petition for his civil commitment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was reversed and the matter was remanded for an evidentiary hearing on whether his plea counsel affirmatively misadvised him he would be released from custody shortly after his plea. The trial court's determination that defendant's plea could not be withdrawn due to failure to advise him of the collateral consequence of the possibility of civil commitment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company appealed a trial court's non-final order granting appellee insurance company's motion to dismiss and staying the proceedings pending completion of arbitration mandated by Florida statutory law, entered by the Circuit Court, Miami-Dade County (Florida), where appellant brought a class action suit against appellee for appellee's failure to pay statutory interest due upon late payment of personal injury protection claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company filed a class action suit against appellee insurance company for failure to pay statutory interest due upon late payment of personal injury protection claims. Appellee responded to the complaint by filing a motion to dismiss, which it subsequently amended to allege that the case should have been arbitrated. In a non-final order, the trial court granted appellee's motion and ordered the case stayed pending arbitration. The basis for its arbitration request was Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 627.736(5)(1995). During the pendency of appellant's challenge to the trial court's non-final order, the Florida Supreme Court held the arbitration provision of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 627.736(5)(1995) was unconstitutional. Appellee maintained that appellant waived the right to contest the statute's unconstitutionality by failing to challenge it in the trial court. The court reversed the trial court's non-final order and held it could not stand. Because the non-final order was interlocutory, it was subject to reconsideration at any time prior to entry of a final order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed as the trial court's non-final order compelling appellant to arbitrate pursuant to Florida statutory law could not stand. The Florida Supreme Court had held the legislature was without authority to enact the applicable statute as it abolished the medical provider's right of access to the courts and appellant was entitled to raise the statute's unconstitutionality because the trial court's order was interlocutory, not final.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the denial of his motion for correction of his sentence pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a), by Pinellas County Circuit Court (Florida), following conviction for sexual battery on child under 16 while in a position of familial authority, and incest, and being sentenced under the 1995 guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the two sexual batteries occurred after the constitutional infirmities in the guidelines were cured. The trial court found that under the 1994 guidelines, as applied to the other two counts, appellant would have scored in a range between 82.35 months to 137.35 months. His score on the other count, under the valid 1995 guidelines, was 115.35 months to 192.25 months. The trial court reasoned that because two different scoresheets were used, appellant could have received consecutive sentences, and his original 22 year sentence fell within the range of the scoresheets, concluding appellant was not adversely affected by the unconstitutional 1995 scoresheet and denying relief. The appellate court found that under the 1994 guidelines, appellant's sentence was a departure sentence. Consequently, he was adversely affected by the amendments found unconstitutional and had to be resentenced on one of the sexual battery convictions and on the incest conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and remanded; because the statute required separate scoresheets for offenses committed when different versions of the guidelines sentencing scoresheets were applicable, appellant had to be resentenced on all of his convictions pursuant to the guidelines applicable to each conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The broadcaster aired an interview with the citizen's former spouse, which ran along with stories of female domestic violence victims. The citizen sued the broadcaster for false light invasion of privacy, alleging that the facts broadcast about him were true, but juxtaposing them with other stories created the false impression that he had abused his wife and children. The trial court dismissed the case; the citizen appealed. The appellate court reversed. The four-year statute of limitations, applicable to torts not otherwise specified, not the two-year statute of limitations for defamation, was applicable. The complaint was improperly dismissed for failing to allege that the broadcaster knew that the facts stated in the broadcast were false, as such falsity was not an element of a false light claim. The trial court erred in ruling that the fair reporting privilege barred the suit because the information in the broadcast was contained in public records. The record showed that the trial court did not compare the broadcast at issue with the public records to determine whether the broadcast was an accurate description of those records.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile delinquent appealed a trial court's adjudication of delinquency and commitment order, entered by the Circuit Court, Dade County (Florida), where the trial court denied his motion to suppress marijuana seized during a search of appellant's person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile delinquent was stopped by police as he rode his bicycle out an alleyway after police received a report that some males were loitering there. The officers requested information about appellant. He alleged the officers spent 10 minutes doing a computer check on him. During that time, he was surrounded by three police officers. The officers searched him and found some marijuana on his person. Appellant moved to suppress the marijuana and alleged its seizure was the product of an illegal stop. The trial court considered several factors in determining whether a seizure had occurred, including the threatening presence of several officers, the display of weapons, physical touching, and the use of language or tone indicative of authority, as well as appellant's contention that he did not feel free to leave. The trial court denied appellant's motion to suppress. He appealed. The court reversed. A reasonable person in appellant's position would not have felt free to disregard the officers' requests, even though appellant was merely engaged in a consensual encounter with police. Thus, the motion to suppress should have been granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed because appellant's motion to suppress should have been granted as marijuana appellant had on his person was confiscated pursuant to an unlawful search. While appellant was engaged in a consensual encounter with police, a reasonable person in his position would not have felt free to leave, as police ordered him to stop, surrounded him by three officers, and officers ran a lengthy records check on him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of burglary of an occupied dwelling with an assault while armed, and two counts of sexual battery with a deadly weapon. All three convictions were classified as life felonies. The crime date was February 15, 1996. On appeal, appellant contended, and the State conceded, that his habitual offender adjudication must be vacated because 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 95-182, which became effective October 1, 1995, had been held unconstitutional on account of a violation of the single subject rule. The court reversed appellant's habitual offender adjudication and remanded for resentencing pursuant to the valid laws in effect on the date the offense was committed. On remand, the trial court was permitted to impose an upward departure sentence if there was a valid reason.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for resentencing; appellant's habitual offender adjudication was vacated on the ground that the habitual felony offender statute in effect at the time appellant committed his crimes had since been declared unconstitutional as violative of the single-subject rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, abortion providers and women's rights organizations, sued in the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) to enjoin the Parental Notice of Abortion Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 390.01115 (1999), and sought a declaratory judgment that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court found the Act was unconstitutional and granted a permanent injunction. Defendants appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act required that, with certain exceptions, a reasonable effort be made to inform at least one parent or legal guardian prior to a minor's abortion. The trial court found that the Act impermissibly infringed on the right to privacy guaranteed under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The appellate court rejected defendants' argument that plaintiffs lacked standing and found that the Act satisfied constitutional requirements. The Act served a compelling state interest by facilitating the ability of parents and guardians to provide appropriate medical care for minors, and judicial waiver provisions served to minimize the intrusion on privacy. The fact that parental notification was not required in connection with other pregnancy-related medical treatment and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases did not result in an equal protection violation. The requirement that a minor provide clear evidence to support a request for a judicial waiver did not offend due process, and the waiver provisions included adequate procedural protections. Provisions making physicians subject to discipline did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was reversed as on its face the Parental Notice of Abortion Act was not unconstitutional, and the judgment was remanded with directions that the permanent injunction be dissolved.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 827.03(1)(b) (1997) was unconstitutional because it was overbroad and void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was employed as a teacher for physically and mentally disabled students in a public school. The State charged her with a six-count information with various acts of child abuse pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 827.03(1)(b) (1997) involving two of her students. Prior to trial, defendant moved to dismiss the information asserting that Fla. Stat. ch. 827.03(1)(b) (1997) was unconstitutional. The trial court conducted a hearing on the motion and declared the subject statute unconstitutionally as overbroad and vague, and the State appealed. The court held it had considered the constitutionality of the statute and found it was not unconstitutional as being overbroad and that the term &quot;mental injury&quot; as used in Fla. Stat. ch. 827.03 (1997) was not vague because it was defined in Fla. Stat. ch. 39.0015(4)(iv) (1998). The court reversed, holding the trial court erred in dismissing the charges and certified the question of whether &quot;mental injury&quot; under Fla. Stat. ch. 827.03(1)(b) (1996) was unconstitutional because it was vague.</SPAN></P>

She settled with the hospital and submitted her claim against appellant to arbitration. In an administrative appeal from the Division of Administrative Hearings (Florida), the court, on a second motion for rehearing, substituted the following for its previous opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the statutory scheme governing arbitration of medical malpractice claims, there was a cap in Fla. Stat. ch. 766.207(7)(h) on the amount of damages appellee could be awarded for non-economic damages. She was awarded the maximum allowable award for non-economic damages in the arbitration proceedings. Appellant contended the amount of her settlement with another responsible party should be offset against her non-economic damages award to prevent her from recovering more than the statutory maximum. The legislature intended the maximum in ch. 766.207(7)(h) to be &quot;per incident&quot; and not &quot;per defendant&quot;, so an individual who received this amount for this type of damage was considered to have been fully compensated. If a portion of these damages were received through a settlement, even if the settlement did not distinguish between economic and non-economic damages, the amount of the settlement would be offset against the amount of the non-economic damage award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arbitration panel was reversed because the amount appellee had previously received in a settlement with another responsible party should have been offset against the amount of its award for non-economic damages.

Further, the State presented evidence defendant qualified as a habitual violent felony offender. The trial court announced at sentencing that defendant was a habitual violent offender.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of agriculture challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Hendry County (Florida) entering a temporary injunction prohibiting it from acting on an immediate final order to destroy citrus trees infected with citrus canker and requiring it to treat appellee as property owner for purposes of notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state department of agriculture issued an immediate final order (IFO) advising a citrus grove it had discovered citrus canker on its property and all infected trees would be destroyed as mandated by Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 5B-58.001(5)(c). The grove owner did not contest the IFO, however appellee, a leasee of the citrus grove owner, filed a motion for temporary injunction, arguing that it had a right to be heard in connection with appellant's decision. The trial court entered the injunction, finding appellee was a property owner within the meaning of Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 5B-58.001(5)(c), and that it was entitled to notice under the rule. Appellant challenged the ruling, arguing the trial court erred by entering the injunction and requiring it to treat appellee as property owner for purposes of notice. The court held the trial court erred by entering the injunction where appellee sought judicial intervention in the wrong forum and did not exhaust its administrative remedies, and held the term &quot;property owner&quot; for purposes of notice meant the land owner holding legal title to the property, not a leasee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed, because the trial court should not have entered the injunction where appellee sought judicial intervention in the wrong forum and did not exhaust its administrative remedies, and the term property owner for purposes of notice meant the land owner holding legal title to the property, not a leasee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees sued appellant for medical malpractice. The Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), found for appellees. The trial judge awarded plaintiffs attorney fees using a multiplier of two on the basis that such was necessary for them to obtain competent counsel; appellant challenged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The effect of the 2.0 multiplier was to award plaintiff's counsel an hourly fee of $ 550.00. The primary issue on appeal was the use of this multiplier. Appellant argued the trial court applied the multiplier without making any factual findings regarding its propriety and in the absence of any evidence that appellees could not have obtained competent counsel absent the availability of a contingency risk multiplier. No evidence was adduced to show that other attorneys were not available to the appellees on a contingency basis with no multiplier available. The multiplier provides an incentive to a lawyer to represent a client in a case in which few lawyers would venture. The appellate court concluded the multiplier was improperly applied where there was an absence of any evidence indicating that a premium was necessary to obtain competent counsel. There was no legal basis to uphold the fee award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on an earlier holding in Strahan, the appellate court vacated the attorney fee award and remanded to the trial court for the award of a reasonable fee without the use of a multiplier. It affirmed the trial court in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court previously reversed defendant's sentence, remanding to the trial court for reconsideration. Subsequently, the trial court reimposed sentences on two counts in a 1997 case, and a 1998 case, charges defendant incurred while on probation in the 1997 case. The trial court clearly announced that defendant was allowed credit for time served, however, the written sentences had a check by prison credit but nothing indicated by jail credit. Defendant appealed regarding the lower court's resentencing order and also filed a motion to correct. The motion raised the credit issue and alleged a Heggs error since the offenses were committed within the window period. Subsequently, the lower court denied defendant's motion on the incorrect basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the motion to correct since an appeal was pending. The appellate court affirmed the sentence, remanding for correction of the written sentencing order regarding time served.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was clear from the transcript that the 1995 sentencing guidelines were utilized.

There was no evidence of any physical injuries. The trial court held the statute to be overbroad and vague. The court reversed, and certified the question whether &quot;mental injury&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. Overbreadth and vagueness were distinct doctrines. The statute was not substantially overbroad and could be upheld against an overbreadth argument by narrowly construing it as not applicable to speech. The lack of definition of a vague term, such as &quot;dependent child,&quot; in a penal statute did not make the statute unconstitutionally vague if a definition of the term could be found in other statutes. &quot;Mental injury&quot; was defined in Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued two physicians in the Circuit Court for the 15th Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), for malpractice, and the jury assigned a percentage of negligence to each. Judgment was entered, jointly and severally, against both defendants. The trial court denied the motion of one defendant to apportion the jury's award for pain and suffering. The defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff consulted one of the defendants concerning a wound on a toe. The first defendant diagnosed gangrene but did not advise surgery. It became apparent surgery was necessary, but first defendant did not schedule it immediately. Before surgery, plaintiff complained the toe had started to fall off, but first defendant advised waiting. Due to pain in his foot, plaintiff sought the services of another physician, the second defendant, who performed an amputation and a procedure to increase the blood supply to plaintiff's leg above the knee. It was later necessary to amputate plaintiff's leg below the knee. At trial, the jury was instructed when a tortfeasor injured someone who was further damaged by negligent medical care for the injuries, the original tortfeasor's actions were the proximate cause of all of the injuries. This instruction was not error because one view of the evidence supported the theory defendants were not joint tortfeasors. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.81, the non-economic damage portion of an award against joint tortfeasors was required to be apportioned. It was apparent the jury found both defendants to be joint tortfeasors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury's verdict was affirmed. The trial court was directed to apportion non-economic damages between defendants. A question was certified to the supreme court asking if a tortfeasor's liability for subsequent medical negligence was abrogated by statute and whether it applied if the initial tort was medical malpractice and both the initial and subsequent tortfeasors were sued in the same action.</SPAN></P>

He entered a plea of no contest and was sentenced to 20 years with a 15 year minimum mandatory term followed by 10 years probation.

He timely filed a notice of appeal in which he challenged the voluntariness of his plea and the propriety of his sentence under the 1995 sentencing guidelines. The court found the trial court properly denied the voluntariness of plea claim as procedurally time barred. The 15 year minimum mandatory sentence, however, was improper. The life felony was added to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(4)(b)1 by chapter 95-182, Laws of Florida, which was declared unconstitutional. Since appellant's offense occurred within the time frame applicable for challenges to chapter 95-182, his sentence was improper. The State conceded this point.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the conditions of his community control upon his conviction for sexual battery upon a minor imposed by the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida), arguing the requirements that he refrain from engaging in activities or residing at a place where children regularly congregate were unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting a minor. As a condition of his community control, appellant was prohibited from living near or working at a school, daycare center, park, playground, or other place where children regularly congregated. He challenged the terms of his community control, arguing both conditions created impermissible vagueness created by the phrase &quot;or other place where children regularly congregate.&quot; The court held the standard for testing vagueness under Florida law was whether the statute gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what constituted forbidden conduct. The court affirmed, holding the terms of appellant's community control were sufficiently precise to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what constituted forbidden conduct; therefore, the requirements were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed, because the two conditions that appellant not engage in activities or live in a place where children regularly congregate were sufficiently precise to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what constituted forbidden conduct; therefore, the requirements were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction in the Circuit Court for Lee County (Florida) for possession of cocaine, arguing the trial court erred by denying his dispositive motion to suppress the drug evidence seized because he was illegally detained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer was conducting routine checks of businesses to protect against vandalism in a neighborhood that contained mixed residential and commercial units. He noticed appellant and a companion enter a parked vehicle and two other people in the vicinity. He had received no reports of criminal activity or noticed any illegal behavior by any of the four. However, the officer decided to question appellant and the passenger about the purpose of their activities in the area, believing they may have been loitering or prowling. As the officer was questioning the passenger, appellant began vomiting and dropped a bag of cocaine. The officer arrested appellant for possession of cocaine. Appellant filed a motion to suppress the drug evidence prior to trial, arguing the officer illegally detained him; therefore, the evidence was inadmissible. The court held a mere feeling or belief that criminal activity was under way was insufficient to support an investigatory stop. The court reversed, holding the officer failed to articulate a factual foundation to justify the investigatory stop and absent the illegal stop, the officer would not have discovered the cocaine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed, because the investigatory stop of appellant failed to meet the constitutional requirements of search and seizure law, and, absent the illegal stop, the officer would not have discovered the cocaine. Accordingly, the court reversed the trial court's judgment because it erred by failing to suppress the dispositive evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant government motor vehicle agency appealed the trial court's interlocutory order granting appellee motorists class certification, entered by the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), where appellees sought refunds for funds they paid into the state treasury pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. 325.214(2)(1995), but where none of the appellees complied with the provisions of the refund statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 215.26.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee motorists filed an amended complaint, and in count I, sought a declaratory judgment that a motor vehicle inspection fee charged to them violated the state constitution because it exceeded the program's cost. The program included the enactment of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 325.214(2)(West 1995) which provided an amount that the inspection fee was not to exceed and gave appellant government motor vehicle agency the authority to set by rule a regulatory amount to be included in the fee commensurate with the cost of administering and enforcing the program. Appellees moved to maintain their suit in the trial court as a class action. The trial court determined that action was maintainable on behalf of a class and entered an appropriate order. Appellant filed an interlocutory order. The court reversed the order granting class certification only as it pertained to count I of the amended complaint, the declaratory judgment action. Where appellees' challenge to a statute was an &quot;as applied&quot; constitutional challenge, not a &quot;facial&quot; challenge, they were required to first seek a refund before filing suit in the trial court. Because they did not do so, the order had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State appealed the Circuit Court for Duval County's (Florida) final order which dismissed the criminal charges against appellees for several counts of unlawful insurance solicitation, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 817.234(8), and one violation of Florida's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The court found that the State had to prove that the solicitation was made with the intent to defraud.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were charged with several violations of Fla. Stat. ch. 817.234(8), Florida's anti-solicitation statute. The charges alleged that appellees had unlawfully solicited business from the victims for the purpose of making motor vehicle tort claims or claims for personal injury protection (PIP) benefits. The court affirmed the dismissal of the charges. However, the trial court erred in finding that fraudulent intent was an element of ch. 817.234(8). The court held that the statute violated U.S. Const. amend. I and Florida Const. art. I, &sect; 4. As written, ch. 817.234(8), was far too broad in terms of the scope of activities it could potentially reach. The statute only related to solicitations made for the purpose of making motor vehicle tort claims or claims for PIP benefits. Every solicitation of business from an accident victim in the context had the potential of being funded by the proceeds of a tort settlement or PIP claim. There was no legitimate basis for not informing an injured person of all available funding sources. The statute was, therefore, not narrowly tailored to only address the state's interest in preventing insurance fraud.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because the statute as written violated both the United States Constitution and the Florida Constitution as it was not narrowly tailored to only address the state's interest in preventing insurance fraud. However, fraudulent intent was not an element of the offense defined in the solicitation statute.</SPAN></P>

If the trust beneficiary had died childless, the remainder of the trust would have gone to appellant. When the trust beneficiary died, appellee asserted his rights to inherit under the trust. Appellant filed an action in 1999 to void the adoption as a fraud on the court, alleging that the trust beneficiary and appellee were a gay couple, that the adoption violated Fla. Stat. ch. 63.042(3) (1993), and that the adoption was a subterfuge to deprive her of her inheritance. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it did not sufficiently allege fraud on the court and was thus time barred because it was not brought within one year under the provisions of Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.540(b). Appellant sought review. Judgment was reversed, because appellant had standing to question the legitimacy of the adoption and appellant's allegations were sufficient for her to maintain an independent action to set aside the judgment of adoption based upon fraud on the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State prosecuted defendant vendor in the sale of switchblade knives under Fla. Stat. ch. 790.225 (1997). The trial court found that statute to be unconstitutionally vague and dismissed the information. The court found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute did not implicate conduct protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. When the statute was read as a whole, the statute imparted to a person of common intelligence and understanding that possessing a switchblade knife would be a crime. The Florida Legislature thereby intended to make the possession of switchblade knifes, which propel a knifelike blade as a projectile by means of a coil spring, elastic material, or compressed gas, illegal while allowing possession of other types of knives or pocketknives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Victim was robbed while washing her car. She did not get a good look at the robber's face, but described his general appearance, clothes, and build to the police. Victim later pointed defendant out to the police as the robber.

The trial court permitted the detective who took victim's description of the robber and victim's boyfriend to testify as to victim's description of the robber.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order from the Circuit Court for Bradford County (Florida), finding that appellant's petition was one for writ of certiorari, and denying it as untimely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Florida Department of Corrections imposed a disciplinary sanction against appellant. Appellant challenged the sanction. The circuit court treated the mandamus petition as a petition for a writ of certiorari and denied it as untimely. Appellant timely petitioned for a writ of certiorari to review the circuit court's order. Appellee moved to relinquish jurisdiction, noting that the circuit court petition was apparently filed within 30 days of denial of appellant's last administrative grievance. Appellant's selection of mandamus as his circuit court remedy was correct. The conversion of the petition from mandamus to certiorari was therefore unnecessary. This error had no bearing on these proceedings, however, as both remedies were subject to a 30 day jurisdictional time limit. The court found that a disposition more appropriate than relinquishment of jurisdiction was to reverse and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion to correct an illegal sentence pursuant to the Florida Supreme Court's finding the sentencing statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant entered pleas of guilty to felony driving while under the influence of alcohol, and driving with a suspended, revoked, or canceled license. The trial court sentenced him to a 75-month sentence and time served. Three years later, appellant filed a Fla. R. Crim. P. Rule 3.800 motion to correct the illegal sentence, arguing that he was entitled to be resentenced pursuant to Heggs. The trial court denied appellant's motion stating that his sentence would have been the same under the previous sentencing guidelines. The appellate court reversed. There was no way for the appellate court to determine if appellant was entitled to relief because the trial court did not attach the score sheet to the order denying relief. However, since appellant entered a plea, he would not necessarily be entitled to resentencing. Further, because the sentence received was imposed as part of a plea process, part of the quid pro quo, for which the state dropped an additional count of aggravated child abuse, the remedy would not be an automatic re-sentencing. The state could either agree to a guideline sentence or withdraw from the plea agreement and go to trial on the original charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and remanded because the trial court failed to attach the score sheet to the order denying relief. Thus, the appellate court could not determine if appellant was entitled to relief. The trial court was ordered, upon remand, to attach the documents refuting appellant's claim.</SPAN></P>

The petition was denied, defendant appealed, and the appeal was dismissed but treated as a writ of certiorari petition, which was granted and remanded with directions to treat it as a mandamus petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed defendant's petition for writ of mandamus, before it on remand, on the grounds defendant was either required to comply with Fla.

Appellant argued that the circuit court abused its discretion and committed fundamental error by sentencing appellant as a habitual felony offender, thus imposing an impermissible double enhancement for his battery on a law enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of battery on a law enforcement officer, and was sentenced as a habitual offender. Appellant argued on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion and committed fundamental error by sentencing him as a habitual felony offender, thus imposing an impermissible double enhancement. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. While appellant's status as a habitual felony offender was simply a tool to enhance the offender's sentence, the victim's status as a law enforcement officer was an element of the crime, which was to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the sentence had only been enhanced once under the habitual offender statute resulting in no double jeopardy violation. The court distinguished a case relied upon by appellant which held that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 784.07, which created the crime of battery on a law enforcement officer, applied to completed crimes and not attempted crimes. The court further stated that the Florida Supreme Court in that case did not hold that &sect; 784.07 was merely an enhancement statute, but merely commented to that effect in dicta.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant guardians petitioned the court to authorize Medicaid planning. In so doing, appellants alleged that appellee incapacitated party, 86 years-old, could be expected to live another 6 years but would deplete all of her assets to pay for nursing expenses in less than one year. They sought to undertake Medicaid planning by gifting to appellee's only daughter, the sole beneficiary under her will, a monthly sum from appellee's available assets. The trial court declined to hold an evidentiary hearing, denied appellants' petition, and concluded spending down her assets in order to make appellee eligible for Medicaid was neither necessary or essential to appellee's well-being. Appellants challenged that holding. The court reversed. An evidentiary hearing was necessary to determine whether, after the transfer of funds, there would be a period of ineligibility before appellee could qualify for Medicaid benefits, and if so, whether sufficient funds would exist during the ineligibility to provide nursing care. The trial court was also directed to apply the substituted judgment standard, placing the guardian in the shoes of the ward, to appellants' petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for felony driving while license suspended (DWLS) and driving with an expired license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), which granted appellee county sheriff's motion for summary judgment and denied appellants' cross-motion for summary judgment, in appellants' suit challenging the constitutionality of uniform fees and processing fees charged to prisoners under Fla. Stat. ch. 951.033.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the authority of Fla. Stat. ch. 951.033, appellee county sheriff implemented a procedure which provided that inmates would be charged a one-time uniform fee of $ 10 and a daily subsistence fee of $ 2, with both charges deducted from each inmate's cash account held by the sheriff. Appellant prisoners challenged the statute, asserting that the statute was void for vagueness and unconstitutional as applied. Appellants questioned whether the $ 10 uniform fee constituted subsistence costs under the statute. The court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed. Appellee's policy did not violate the statute and was not overly vague. Appellee's procedure provided that the fee defrayed the costs of uniforms and nothing in the record suggested that the fee was used for anything else. Uniforms were clearly included within the term subsistence. The statute set forth factors for appellee to consider in determining financial status and whether an inmate has the ability to pay. Appellee's practice of deducting fees only from accounts with positive balances demonstrated that determinations as to financial status were made with regard to each deduction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Appellee's policy was not overly vague. The uniform fee was used to defray the costs of uniforms, and no evidence was presented that the fee was used for anything else. Uniforms were clearly included within the term subsistence. The statute did not give the appellee unfettered discretion, and appellants and other similarly situated prisoners had adequate notice that a hearing on the procedure was available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Volusia County (Florida) which, after a jury found him to be a sexually violent predator, entered a final judgment of commitment, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 394. The court committed appellant to confinement until such time as his mental abnormality or personality disorder had so changed that it would be safe for him to be at large.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had been convicted of attempted sexual battery on a child under 11 years of age and aggravated assault. He received prison sentences of 30 and 15 years respectively for those offenses. Later, appellee state instituted commitment proceedings against appellant, pursuant to the Jimmy Ryce Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 394, which established procedures for the involuntary civil commitment of sexually violent predators. The jury returned a verdict finding appellant to be a violent sexual predator, and the trial court involuntarily committed him. The appellate court affirmed. Appellant failed to object to the State's improper comment during closing arguments. Thus, it was not preserved for appeal. Also, he did object to an improper statement by the State, which was sustained, but then failed to move for a mistrial. Thus, that was not preserved for appeal. Appellant was not entitled to reversal as he failed to file a motion for a new trial. Some issues argued by appellant had been addressed previously and were affirmed. Others were without merit. The appellate court certified five questions to the highest court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because appellant failed to preserve for appeal improper comments made during closing arguments by the State, as he failed to make a contemporaneous objection, and failed to move for a mistrial on the comment he did object to. As appellant did not file a motion for a new trial, he was not entitled to a reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for robbing a large amount of cash from the victim in his apartment. The trial court sentenced appellant to consecutive life sentences under the Prison Release Reoffender Act (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(8). On appeal, the court held that appellant's consecutive life sentences were improper because the crimes appellant was convicted of arose out of the same criminal episode. However, because appellant failed to object before the trial court and preserve the issue for appellate review, the court was unable to reverse the sentences on direct appeal. Because prior caselaw had already determined that the Act was constitutional, the court overruled appellant's argument that it was unconstitutional. The court also overruled appellant's contention that his double jeopardy rights were violated because the trial court sentenced appellant only as a prison releasee reoffender for each count of the information against him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed Volusia County Circuit Court (Florida) denial of motion to prohibit imposition of sexual predator and offender designations and sanctions, arguing that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 943.043, 943.0435, 944.606, 944.607 (1999) violated Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23, and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; II, IX.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was designated a sexual offender under Florida law, which subjected him to registration and notification requirements less restrictive than those applied to offenders classified as sexual predators. He argued that application of these requirements to him violated his privacy rights under Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23, and also violated basic rights and due process guarantees of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; II, IX. The court compared the Florida provisions with statutes that had been found unconstitutional in other jurisdictions, and found it was tailored far more narrowly to effect its legislative purpose of protecting the public, clearly a compelling State interest, by the least intrusive means possible. Therefore there was no privacy right violation. To establish violation of due process and basic rights guarantees, defendant had to show deprivations of life, liberty, or property. These requirements were regulatory, rather than penal, and they were therefore constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed by adopting trial court's opinion. Florida's statute was narrower than statutes found unconstitutional in other jurisdictions, and registration and notification under sexual offender statute in question were least intrusive means of protecting potential victims. Due process was only implicated where life, liberty, or property were threatened.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) which granted in part and denied in part defendant's motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 in a cause of action brought against defendant by plaintiff state for burglary, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 810.02(3), and robbery, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 812.13(1), 2(c) (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pled guilty, the trial court convicted defendant of burglary and robbery, both second degree felonies, in a cause of action brought against defendant by plaintiff state. Because defendant was alleged to have committed both offenses while wearing a mask, the trial court reclassified defendant's offenses as first-degree felonies. The trial court designated defendant a habitual offender and imposed two concurrent life terms. On remand, the trial court again sentenced defendant to two life terms. Defendant moved for postconviction relief. The trial court granted defendant's motion in part and denied in part, changing defendant's sentences to 30 years maximum with a habitual offender designation. The appellate court reversed and remanded. The trial court erred when it reclassified defendant's offenses because Fla. Stat. ch. 775.0845(4) (1989) only provided for enhanced sentences. The trial court also erred when it maintain the enhancement of defendant's sentence while designating him a habitual offender. On remand, the trial court was instructed to remove the habitual offender designation and to classify defendant's offenses as second-degree felonies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and remanded. The trial court erred when it reclassified defendant's burglary and robbery offenses as first-degree felonies because the statute only called for enhanced sentencing. The trial court also erred in maintaining defendant's habitual offender designation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence in the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, St. Lucie County (Florida), for a variety of charges, including assaulting police officers, resisting arrest with violence, and leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.027(1)(a) (1997).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of multiple charges arising from a high-speed chase by law enforcement, an ensuing accident, and his behavior following the accident. Defendant sought review of his convictions and sentence. The jury's finding of guilt for leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.027(1)(a) (1997), negated a necessary element of the crime of leaving the scene of an accident resulting only in property damage, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.061(1) (1997) so those verdicts were impermissibly inconsistent. Fla. Stat. ch. 921.002(1)(h), regarding sentencing appeals, did not violate due process or equal protection, and did not violate Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 4(b), permitting sentencing appeals, as defendant could still raise constitutional issues such as judicial vindictiveness. The legislature had the authority to change the sentencing structure, and, in doing so, reduce a defendant's statutory rights under earlier versions of sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for leaving the scene of a crash resulting only in property damage and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in injury were reversed because they were impermissibly inconsistent. Otherwise, defendant's convictions and sentences were affirmed because statute regarding sentencing appeals did not violate state constitutional provision allowing such appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his convictions and sentences for driving under the influence manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident involving death, two offenses which sentences were enhanced by a single death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court improperly adjudicated appellant guilty and sentenced him on two separate convictions enhanced by a single death. The State conceded that two convictions enhanced by a single death were improper. The punishment for leaving the scene of an accident was enhanced by a death. Appellant's driving under the influence manslaughter (DUI) conviction had already been enhanced by the death of the same pedestrian. Therefore, the court concluded the leaving the scene conviction could not have been enhanced by that same death, and one of the two convictions needed to be vacated. Because the conviction for the lesser offense was usually vacated, and both offenses were second-degree felonies; the leaving the scene conviction was vacated because it was scored at level five while the DUI manslaughter conviction was scored at level eight. The 1995 sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional. In resentencing, the trial court was instructed to use the valid guidelines in effect on the date of appellant's offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction for driving under the influence manslaughter affirmed, but remanded to vacate conviction for leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, because two convictions could not have been enhanced by the same death. The offense which scored lower was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), which denied his 3.850 motion for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for burglary of a structure and he was sentenced, as a habitual offender, to a nine-year prison term. The trial court denied his motion for post-conviction relief which argued that the 1995 sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed, holding that because appellant was sentenced as a habitual offender under Fla. Stat. ch.  775.084(4)(e), Florida Statutes, he was not subject to the 1995 guidelines provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 921.001. The appellate court further rejected appellant's challenge to career criminal sentencing provisions in the 1995 laws because he was not sentenced as a career criminal. Last, the appellate court affirmed the summary denial of appellant's claim that his gain-time entitlement was illegally reduced, because appellant's gain-time challenge must first be entertained in the Department of Corrections (DOC). Only upon appellant's dissatisfaction with the DOC ruling, he could then file a petition for writ of mandamus with the appropriate circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order denying appellant's motion for post-conviction relief was affirmed. Because appellant was sentenced as a habitual offender, not under 1995 sentencing guidelines, the appellate court refused to entertain appellant's argument that the 1995 sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional. Summary denial of appellant's claim that his gain-time entitlement was illegally reduced was also affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded nolo contendere to a second degree felony of felon in possession of a firearm charge and was sentenced as a habitual offender. He was sentenced to 8 years' imprisonment and challenged his sentence, arguing his sentence was improperly rendered pursuant to the unconstitutional 1995 amendment to the sentencing guidelines. The trial court had rejected appellant's claim on the ground that his classification and sentencing as a habitual offender rendered the sentencing guidelines inapplicable. The court held a habitual offender sentence of 8 years' imprisonment for the second degree felony of felon in possession of a firearm clearly was not an illegal sentence, because Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(4)(a)(2) (1995) permitted a sentence of up to 30 years' imprisonment for a second degree felony. The court affirmed, holding an illegal sentence not only exceeded the statutory maximum penalty but also patently failed to comport with statutory or constitutional limitations, which were not present in the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed, because a habitual offender sentence of eight years' imprisonment for the second degree felony of felon in possession of a firearm clearly was not an illegal sentence where the sentencing guidelines permitted a sentence of up to 30 years' imprisonment for a second degree felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for lewd and lascivious assault upon a child and contributing to the delinquency of a child. He appealed his convictions, arguing the prosecutor impermissibly commented on his right to remain silent during voir dire examination. The prosecutor had asked prospective jurors if they could have found appellant guilty in the absence of an eyewitness and whether they would have been willing to use their common sense to judge the credibility of witnesses. The trial court overruled appellant's objection to the statements and motion for mistrial. The court held, when considered in the context in which the statements were made, they did not constitute an impermissible comment on appellant's right to remain silent. The court affirmed, concluding even if the statements were improper, appellant did not preserve the issue for appellate review because he failed to renew his objection and motion for mistrial before the jury was sworn.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the findings of the Circuit Court for Flagler County (Florida) regarding her fitness and ability to adequately provide for animals, the removal of animals from her possession, and the injunction entered enjoining her from possessing animals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county sought to enjoin appellant from mistreating animals by filing a petition against her under Fla. Stat. ch. 828.073 (1997). The animals on appellant's property were removed pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 828.073, a statute giving law enforcement officers and duly appointed humane society agents the right to provide care to animals in distress. The animals seized were considered appellant's personal property. The deputy and animal cruelty investigator did not enter appellant's property with an intent to arrest or search. Upon arrival, however, they were immediately struck by the animals' condition. The distress of the animals was apparent, and any reasonable person would have concluded that an urgent and immediate need for protective action was warranted. Accordingly, entry onto appellant's property was constitutionally permitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The entry onto appellant's property was justified under the emergency exception to the warrant requirement for searches. The hearing after seizure of appellants' animals was sufficient to satisfy appellant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the trial court denying his motion for postconviction relief filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, arguing his 85 month sentence was illegal because the trial court's scoresheet included an unscoreable burglary conviction for which he was sentenced as a violent career criminal, and his counsel failed to object to the improper calculation on his scoresheet. Further, appellant contended his sentence was illegal because his punishment was assessed under an unconstitutional sentencing guidelines statute. The court held that since the trial court failed to attach a scoresheet or any other records to conclusively refute appellant's first claim, it required reversal and a remand for further proceedings. As to appellant's second claim, the court held the trial court misinterpreted the applicable window period for appeals from the unconstitutional 1995 sentencing guidelines statute. The court reversed, holding the relevant window to challenge the 1995 guidelines was determined by the date of the offense, not sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued ineffective counsel assistance, and court error in denying his motion because his sentences for attempted first-degree murder with a firearm and for armed burglary were illegally enhanced as habitual felony offender sentences. As to the sentence for attempted first-degree murder, a life felony, the court reversed based on the Florida Supreme Court holding that the statutory basis for enhancing a life felony to habitual felony offender status was unconstitutional. Appellant's other conviction, armed burglary, was a first-degree felony punishable by life imprisonment. A life felony was not the same as a first-degree felony punishable by life. A first-degree felony punishable by life could be enhanced by habitual felony offender classification, and appellant was not entitled to resentencing for the offense. The court affirmed his convictions and armed burglary sentence, but reversed his attempted first-degree murder with a firearm sentence, and remanded for sentencing according to guidelines existing on the offense date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction and sentence for robbery with a firearm. On appeal, the appellant contended, inter alia, that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct in closing arguments. At trial, appellant objected and moved for a mistrial based on the prosecutor's comments, and the trial court denied the motion. The court affirmed. The court held that the prosecutor was not raising the &quot;send a message to the community&quot; argument, which the court had found to be egregious and unfair. The prosecutor was addressing appellant's defense that he did not commit the crime, although appellant was there, but that others did it. The prosecutor was asking the jury to determine appellant's guilt, and show him that if he committed a crime, he had to pay for it and could not have shifted the burden and blamed others for his crime. Additionally, if any error occurred, it was harmless. Appellant was positively identified as one of the robbers, and appellant admitted he was present at the scene. Appellant's remaining contentions were held to be without merit. The court vacated appellant's sentence and remanded for resentencing because there was no sentencing scoresheet in the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the ruling of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), which held that Fla. Stat. ch. 229.0537 (1999), containing the provisions of Florida's Opportunity Scholarship Program, was facially unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, a group of parents, Florida citizens, and interest groups, and the state education association, filed two complaints, both alleging that the Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP), Fla. Stat. ch. 229.0537, violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 3; Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1: Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 6; and the Establishment Clause of U.S. Const. amend. I. The cases were consolidated. The trial court held that ch. 229.0537 violated art. IX, &sect; 1 insofar as it established a program through which the state paid tuition for certain students to attend private schools. The court of appeal reversed and remanded, holding that the trial court erred in relying on the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius in finding that the constitution did not permit the legislature to enact the OSP. Art. IX, &sect; 1 did not prescribe the sole means for implementation of the state's mandate to provide a public education.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court judgment reversed and matter remanded. Nothing in the state constitution clearly prohibited the legislature from allowing the well-delineated use of public funds for private school education. The trial court erred in implying such a prohibition and in ignoring the presumption of constitutionality of a statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged Circuit Court for Volusia County ( Florida) involuntary civil commitment on jury verdict pursuant to the &quot;Jimmy Ryce Act,&quot; Fla. Stat. ch. 394.910-.930 (1999), as a sexually violent predator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of sexual assault on a child. The facts disclosed a sadistic sexual relationship between the 22-year-old appellant and 15-year-old female victim. The evidence showed infliction of pain, physical injury by cutting, and bondage. Evidence included shark hooks, knives, and chains. Appellee State subsequently instituted involuntary civil commitment proceedings against him under the &quot;Jimmy Ryce Act,&quot; Fla. Stat. ch. 394.910-.930 (1999). A jury found him a sexually violent predator. The trial judge entered a commitment order for confinement in a secure facility. He appealed the commitment in a case of first impression, arguing the act was unconstitutional and the trial court erred by denying a requested jury instruction and allowing expert opinion testimony that he would reoffend. The court affirmed, finding no constitutional infirmities or judicial error, but certified to the supreme court the constitutionality of the act relative to the ex post facto, double jeopardy, due process, and equal protection clauses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order of commitment was affirmed, as court found no constitutional infirmities in relevant statute, no error in jury instructions given by trial court, and no error in admitting opinion testimony by appellee's experts that appellant would likely reoffend. Relevant statute was civil, so there was no ex post facto violation or double jeopardy; nor was it void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer appealed the decision of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), granting final summary judgment in favor of appellee Florida Department of Revenue, and denying the refund sought by appellant of excise taxes it paid under Fla. Stat. ch. 206.87(1) (1993) when it bought diesel fuel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sued appellee Florida Department of Revenue, seeking a refund of the excise taxes it paid under Fla. Stat. ch. 206.87(1) (1993) when it bought diesel fuel. Appellant contended that, because the fuel was delivered to a common carrier for export to Georgia, a Florida tax on the sale violated the Commerce Clause. The trial court denied appellant a refund, and granted final summary judgment to appellee. Appellant filed an appeal. The court held that the excise tax survived Commerce Clause scrutiny because title to the fuel passed in Florida, thus providing a substantial nexus to the taxing state; the tax passed both the internal and external consistency tests, thus, it was fairly apportioned; the tax burden was the same for out-of-state purchasers as for in-state purchasers; thus, the tax did not discriminate against interstate commerce; and appellant's receipt of police and fire protection, and its use of public roads and the other advantages of a civilized society, satisfied the requirement that the tax be fairly related to benefits provided by Florida to appellant. Consequently, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, inmate, challenged an order denying a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion to correct an illegal sentence. State conceded below that his offenses were committed within the window period for challenging a sentence imposed under 1995 sentencing guidelines, which the Florida Supreme Court found unconstitutional in Heggs. Appellee argued appellant was not entitled to relief, since he was sentenced as a habitual violent felony offender. Appellant claimed he was entitled to resentencing, or allowance of plea withdrawal, since his plea was entered pursuant to a negotiated agreement allowing a mid-guidelines sentence as a habitual offender. The proper vehicle for raising such a claim was a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion for post-conviction relief. Appellant's Rule 3.800(a) motion was not sworn. Thus, the court affirmed the denial without prejudice to his timely filing of a sworn Rule 3.850 motion raising the same ground for relief. Appellant would have two years from the Heggs opinion issuance in which to do so, since the facts on which he based his claim could not have been known earlier, under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850(b)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed since proper vehicle for raising appellant's claim was by a motion for post-conviction relief rather than an unsworn motion to correct an illegal sentence.

Stat. ch. 316.1932(1)(c) (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was driving a motorcycle when he was struck by a car and rendered unconscious. The police smelled alcohol on appellee's breath.

The police requested medical personnel to withdraw a blood sample to determine appellee's blood alcohol level, while appellee was unconscious. Appellee was later charged with driving under the influence and he filed a motion to suppress the blood alcohol results, which was granted because the mere odor of alcohol was insufficient for reasonable cause to believe that appellee was under the influence. The State appealed. Judgment was affirmed, because the sole evidence of an odor of alcohol on appellee's breath was insufficient reasonable cause for the police to believe that appellee was under the influence of alcoholic beverages to subject him to a blood draw under Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1932(1)(c).</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The court found that the constitutionality of the Prison Release Reoffender Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(8) (1997), had been upheld in another case. Regarding appellee's closing argument, the court noted that it was not required to pass upon the prosecutor's eloquence or lack thereof, but rather whether the prosecutor refrained from inflammatory and abusive argument, maintained objectivity, and behaved in a professional manner. The court found that none of the prosecutor's comments was a contender for an eloquence award, but only one appeared to be improper as a comment on facts not in evidence, and the court did not find it so egregious as to require a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(g), and which denied appellant declaratory and injunctive relief against appellee county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizen filed a declaratory judgment action against appellee county alleging that the Broward County Domestic Partnership Act of 1999 (DPA), Broward Co., Fla., Code &sect;16 1/2-151(a) (1999) violated Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(g). Appellant contended that the DPA was invalid because it involved appellee county's intrusion into an area that was one of purely statewide concern and because it was inconsistent with general law. Appellant filed motions for summary judgment. The lower court entered judgment rejecting appellant's constitutional challenge and denying his request for declaratory and injunctive relief. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The appellate court held that DPA did not intrude to a substantial degree into a matter inherently reserved for the state alone. The appellate court held however that the DPA did conflict with Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 765.401 (1999) in that it provided for a different order of priority in the absence of a patient's designation of a person to make health care decisions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of second-degree murder and, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, was sentenced to an 84-month term of incarceration. Subsequently, appellant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence, arguing he was sentenced pursuant to the 1995 guidelines and that his sentence was illegal, as the sentencing guidelines had been ruled unconstitutional. The court initially noted appellant sufficiently alleged that his crimes were committed within the applicable window period and that the sentence he received under the 1995 guidelines could not have been imposed under the 1994 guidelines absent an upward departure. However, the court reversed, but held because appellant's original sentence was the result of a plea agreement, the State had the option on remand of proceeding to trial on the original charges or to have appellant resentenced under the 1994 sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed, because although appellant was entitled to relief from the unconstitutional sentencing guidelines, his original sentence was the result of a plea agreement; therefore, the State had the option on remand of proceeding to trial on the original charges or have appellant resentenced under the 1994 sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that any defendant sentenced to &sect; 775.084 as amended, for an offense occurring between October 1, 1995, and May 24, 1997, had standing to assert the single subject rule challenge. The court said that in the future, those defendants who had available the procedural mechanism of the recently amended Fla. R. Crim.

Specifically, appellant alleged that a corrected scoresheet prepared under the 1994 guidelines would have produced a sentencing range of 108 to 180 months. The court held appellant's offense was committed within the window period during which the 1995 amendments to the sentencing guidelines were later deemed unconstitutional. The court reversed, holding the trial court erred in assessing punishment and remanded the matter for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed, because appellant's offense was committed within the window period during which the 1995 amendments to the sentencing guidelines were later deemed unconstitutional; therefore, the trial court erred in assessing appellant's punishment under those guidelines.</SPAN></P>

There was no evidence indicating appellant ever used the pocketknife during the burglary, or that he threatened anyone with the pocketknife at any time. Fla. Stat. ch. 790.001(13) (1995) excluded a &quot;common pocketknife&quot; from the definition of &quot;weapon.&quot; The Florida Supreme Court held that ch. 790.001(13) was not unconstitutionally vague and that a pocketknife was not a weapon. However, the court held that the Florida Supreme Court's decision should not have been applied retroactively and appellant's conviction for armed burglary was affirmed.

The mother was alarmed to the point of dashing into the room and taking the child in her arms out of the room. Although appellant did not point the gun at the child, he pointed it at the ceiling. That type of irrational, hostile, and reckless behavior by an excited or agitated person, unfortunately often resulted in shootings, which perhaps were not intended. Therefore, there were undisputed facts and inferences that were sufficient for the trial judge to conclude appellant's intentional acts placed the child in a zone of &quot;reasonably expected&quot; physical danger.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the October 1996 offenses of robbery, aggravated battery, and aggravated assault. Based on a negotiated plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to a 55-month term of incarceration pursuant to the 1995 sentencing guidelines in exchange for a guilty plea to the crime of aggravated assault with a firearm. Defendant filed a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion, alleging that his sentence was illegal. Under the Heggs standard, defendant was clearly entitled to seek relief from his sentence. Thus, the order appealed was reversed. However, defendant was not entitled to automatic resentencing under the 1994 guidelines because his original sentence was the result of a plea agreement. The State dropped and/or reduced the additional charges against defendant in exchange for his plea to aggravated assault. Thus, the State had the option on remand of proceeding to trial on the original charges or electing to have defendant resentenced under the 1994 sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the trial court erred when it adjudicated him guilty of both grand theft and dealing in the same stolen property. The court held that the trial court could convict appellant of both grand theft and dealing in the same stolen property because Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which denied postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In April, 1999, defendant entered into a plea bargain in two circuit court cases. He agreed to be sentenced as a habitual offender to six years incarceration, followed by five years probation. The plea bargain covered two second-degree felonies and two third-degree felonies. In March, 2000, defendant filed a timely motion for postconviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. He argued that because the 1995 sentencing guidelines had been held unconstitutional earlier in 2000, he was entitled to be resentenced. The trial court denied relief and defendant appealed. He contended he was entitled to have his habitual offender designation stricken, and his sentence treated as a guidelines sentence. He also contended that because the 1995 sentencing guidelines were held unconstitutional, he was entitled to resentencing under the pre-1995 guidelines. The court concluded that defendant was not entitled to this relief. The habitual offender disposition was the subject of defendant's valid plea bargain and thus had to be upheld. However, the court remanded for technical correction of his sentences on two counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for reduction of the sentences on the third-degree felonies to the 10-year legal maximum. Defendant's sentence was a habitual offender sentence that did not exceed the statutory maximum for his offense, and it was the result of a valid plea bargain; thus, it was upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for having sexual intercourse with a female under the age of 16. Because he penetrated the victim, 80 additional points were added to appellant's sentencing scoresheet pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 921.0011(7)(b) and 921.0014(1)(a). Appellant challenged, arguing that his equal protection rights had been violated because a female offender would receive only 40 additional points because she would not have penetrated her victim. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's sentence, holding that neither statute, on its face, treated males differently from females. The court construed Fla. Stat. ch. 921.0011(7)(b)1 to require the assessment of victim injury points regardless of whether it was a male or female who committed the offense of sexual battery by the act of sexual intercourse because the act of sexual intercourse involved sexual contact that included sexual penetration, which included the touching the victim by a female offender with her sexual organ.</SPAN></P>

The court noted the applicable window period for challenging 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 95-182 on single subject rule grounds opened on October 1, 1995, and closed on May 24, 1997, the date on which 1997 Fla. Laws ch. 97-97 reenacted the provisions contained in 1995 Fla.

The court construed appellant's petition as a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion, and summarily struck it as an abuse of process since appellant had previously filed such motion. Appellant also argued that the court sentenced him under an unconstitutional statute. Later, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that Fla. Stat. ch. 95-184 was unconstitutional since it violated the single subject provision of the state constitution. Appellant could file a motion for collateral relief, under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a), alleging that he fell within the window period, and that his sentence could not have been imposed under the 1994 guidelines without a departure.

She filed suit in county court against appellee after appellee notified her that it was terminating chiropractic and medical payments coverage which it had provided pursuant to her automobile insurance policy. Appellee responded by filing a motion to dismiss/motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the terms of the parties' insurance contract. The circuit court rendered an order compelling the parties to arbitration pursuant to the language of the policy which was mandated by Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(5). The Florida Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the portions of &sect; 627.736(5) which made arbitration mandatory and imposed a prevailing party standard with regard to attorneys' fees. Thus, the order was reversed. However, the court held that the continued viability of appellant's case turned on whether appellant entered into an assignment of her benefits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 1994 Everglades Forever Act (Act) authorized appellee, the South Florida Water Management District, to levy on property within its district for pollution abatement. In 1996, Amendment 5 to the Act was adopted to provide that those who caused water pollution within the district would have been primarily responsible for paying the costs of abatement of the pollution. Appellants filed suit against appellee after they were taxed for abatement costs following the adoption of Amendment 5. The trial court found appellee had a statutory basis to continue imposing the abatement tax and appellants challenged appellee's authority to tax them for that purpose. The court held because Amendment 5 was not self-executing, the Act remained in effect until repealed by the legislature. Therefore, the court affirmed, finding the trial court did not err in determining the Act provided a statutory basis to levy taxes against appellants, non-polluting land owners, to abate the pollution.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding that the arresting officers acted without unnecessary delay, their pursuit of the defendant was continuous and uninterrupted, and there was a close temporal relationship between the commission of the offense and the commencement of the pursuit and apprehension of the suspect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the ruling of the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida) that its charter provision placing a term limit on the office of clerk of the court was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court declared that a provision of appellant's city charter placing a term limit on the office of clerk of the court was unconstitutional after appellee, who was not allowed to run for office again under the charter, filed a complaint for declaratory relief. The court found that a state or local qualification for a constitutional office could have only been unconstitutional if it conflicted with a qualification for that office set forth in the constitution. It further found that the provision in question did not conflict with the constitution or had the constitution undertaken to set forth all of the requirements for that office. Therefore, appellant was free to adopt non-conflicting qualifications for the office and the charter provision which had been challenged was constitutional. Expert testimony was allowed as long as it did not express an opinion on the ultimate issue before the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court's ruling finding term limit provision for a local office in appellant's charter unconstitutional was reversed because the provision did not conflict with the state constitution or had the state constitution attempted to set forth all of the qualifications for the office in question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for aggravated manslaughter of an elderly or disabled person in the Circuit Court for Osceola County (Florida).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and his brother were convicted of aggravated manslaughter of an elderly or disabled person under Fla. Stat. ch. 782.07(2), in connection with the death of their 82-year-old mother. Appellant contended that he was not culpable for the death because his brother was the one who had taken responsibility for his mother's care. Appellant contended that he was seldom home and that the arrangement with his brother continued over many years. The court affirmed, noting the highly egregious conditions in which the elderly woman was found when authorities were called. The evidence was sufficient to establish a breach of duty owed by appellant as a &quot;caregiver,&quot; as well as under the common law. That the brothers had agreed that one would do the actual work of caring for their mother did not excuse appellant from the duty of overseeing the care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction affirmed. Appellant had a legal duty under both the statute and common law to care for his mother himself, or to obtain care for her from others, and to make reasonable efforts to protect her from the abuse and neglect she suffered under the &quot;care&quot; of his brother.</SPAN></P>

The court held appellant waived the right to be present during critical stages of his trial where the record revealed his waiver was voluntary and intelligent. The court further found appellant refused appointed counsel at his sentencing hearing and was deemed to have exercised his right to self-representation. Therefore, the court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence as a prison releasee reoffender, but reversed his sentence as a violent career criminal under prevailing case law.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued the statutory provision in effect during the relevant taxing periods, Fla. Stat. ch. 220.13(1)(b)(2)(b) (1991), violated the Foreign Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, because the statute, by piggybacking on the federal tax code, treated domestic subsidiaries more favorably than foreign subsidiaries. The court held the Florida Department of Revenue utilized the federal definition of taxable income, and, in appellant's case, made those necessary adjustments to avoid discriminatory treatment of the foreign subsidiary dividends. Therefore, the court affirmed, holding the statute was non-discriminatory and appellant failed to meet its heavy burden of demonstrating that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a motion with the trial court claiming that he was wrongfully sentenced under the unconstitutional 1995 amendments to the sentencing guidelines. The trial court denied his motion based on a window period commencing October 1, 1995 and closing September 30, 1996. However, the Florida Supreme Court subsequently determined that the window period opened on October 1, 1995 and closed on May 24, 1997. Because appellant's criminal offenses took place on December 24, 1996, the court found that appellant was potentially able to seek relief on this basis. However, the court noted that appellant had only established half of his burden. The second half was whether his recommended sentence under the 1994 sentencing guidelines would have been less than the recommended sentence under the unconstitutional 1995 amendments. In sum, appellant had not alleged that he was affected by the unconstitutional legislation. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment below, but without prejudice to appellant to file another motion setting forth the two-fold basis for the relief sought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of the Circuit Court for Marion County (Florida), which denied appellant's motion filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 and 3.800(a), which challenged appellant's sentences for aggravated child abuse and child abuse on the ground that they were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the summary denial of his motion filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 and 3.800(a), which contended that his sentences for aggravated child abuse and child abuse were unconstitutional, because the sentencing guidelines under the Crime Control Act of 1995 violated single subject rule of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The court reversed. The Florida Supreme Court had ruled that the Crime Control Act of 1995 was unconstitutional. Appellant made a legally sufficient claim for relief. Because appellant's sentence was imposed as part of a plea process, however, the remedy for appellant was not an automatic resentencing. The court remanded for further proceedings, with directions for the trial court to review the record and determine if the plea agreement contemplated that appellant would receive a guidelines sentence. If guideline considerations were not part of the plea agreement, relief can be denied. If guideline considerations were part of the plea agreement, the state would have the option of taking appellant to trial on all of the original charges, or resentencing him under the guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed. Appellant's sentence was imposed under sentencing guidelines that were unconstitutional. The court remanded because appellant's sentence was imposed as part of a plea process, so automatic resentencing was not a remedy available to appellant, and the trial court was directed to review the record and determine if the plea agreement contemplated that appellant would receive a guidelines sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Escambia County (Florida), which denied appellant's motion to correct an illegal sentence, filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a). Appellant argued that because the offense occurred prior to the effective date of the sentencing guidelines, the sentence was illegal, and appellant should have been given the choice of a sentence under the guidelines or under the pre-guideline law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's denial of appellant's motion to correct an illegal sentence, and remanded the cause. Appellant pled no contest to an armed robbery, which occurred prior to July 1, 1984, and received an upward departure sentence. Appellant filed a motion pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800 alleging that the sentence was illegal and that appellant was entitled to be resentenced under the law in effect at the time of the offense, which would make the sentence parole-eligible. On review the court found that the sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional for offenses committed prior to July 1, 1984, and that the sentence was an illegal sentence. The court further found that appellant should have been given the choice to be sentenced under the guidelines or under the pre-guideline law, and held that it was immaterial whether the appellant received a sentence within the recommended range or a departure sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of appellant's motion to correct an illegal sentence was reversed and remanded because the offense occurred prior to constitutional enactment of the sentencing guidelines, and any sentence entered under the guidelines prior to enactment was an illegal sentence that could be challenged at any time. The court held that the fact that appellant received a departure sentence was immaterial.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the imposition of a sentence under both the prison releasee re-offender and habitual felony offender statutes violated double jeopardy principles. The court rejected appellant's arguments that the Prison Re-offender Act violated the equal protection, due process, separation of powers, and single subject clauses of the Florida Constitution, stating that the statute had already been declared constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of 29 separate counts of violating the money laundering statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 896.101(2)(a) (Supp. 1996), for writing 29 separate checks from an account that contained proceeds of an extensive insurance fraud. Defendant did not challenge the conclusion that she violated the statute, but claimed that she could not lawfully have been convicted of more than one offense. The court rejected this contention and affirmed the lower court judgment. The court noted that, in interpreting the language of similar money-laundering statutes, it was well settled that the allowable unit of prosecution was each particular financial transaction involved. The court also rejected defendant's double jeopardy claim, which was based on the fact that the information was drafted so that all 29 claims of illegal activity were included in the final count. According to the court, the fact that the information was poorly drafted did not raise a double jeopardy issue when it was clear that defendant committed 29 punishable offenses and that she was tried and found guilty by the jury for each of those violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State brought action, alleging appellants misled owners of timeshare properties, inducing them into contracting with appellants to advertise timeshares for sale. Appellants were also charged with failing to furnish their consumers notice of their right to cancel within three days. The charge was not settled, and the appeal challenged the assessment of penalties for failing to give the notice of right to cancel, as well as other issues. The court affirmed on all issues raised by appellants. As to the arguments that the civil penalties were unconstitutional as excessive fines under the Florida Constitution, the court disagreed. There was evidence that as many as 38,000 customers had been victimized. Appellants charged consumers $ 395 for services. During the relevant time period, appellants took in over $ 13 million in income. The court did not find the penalties excessive, and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant committed an armed robbery within three years of his release from prison and the State sought a sentence enhancement pursuant to the Prison Releasee Reoffender Act (Act), Fla.

The trial court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment and he challenged his sentence asserting the Act was unconstitutional as it violated the separation of powers doctrine and that he qualified under an extenuating circumstances provision of the Act due to his drug addiction. Appellant alleged his drug addiction prevented him from possessing the requisite intent to commit the crime and otherwise entitled him to a lesser sentence. The court held the Act's constitutionality had previously been upheld in the face of a separation of powers challenge and refused to invalidate it simply because the prosecutor had broad discretion to seek the enhancement and the decision was not otherwise subject to judicial review. The court affirmed, finding a prosecutor's decision to seek the Act's enhancement was a matter for the public electing him to evaluate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowners sought certiorari review of a Circuit Court, Appellate Division, Dade County (Florida), decision that upheld respondent local agency's determination to grant respondent property owners' application for a special exception, an unusual use, and several non-use variances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent local zoning board granted respondent developer's application to develop commercially zoned land as a self-storage facility and also approved developing adjoining land, that was zoned residential, for parking, on grounds that respondent agency's land use plan should not be strictly applied when this would violate fundamental fairness. The court held that it could review petitioner adjoining landowners' objection immediately, since respondent agency had already admitted that it was violating the plan to which it was subject. The court held that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 163.3194(a) (West 1999) made it clear that local zoning authorities could act in violation of their own governing plans only in very limited instances, not present in this case. While non-commercial parking was a permitted special use in derogation of a land use plan, a parking area intended to serve a commercial development was commercial as well, so respondent agency acted beyond its powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition and quashed the decision as contrary to law, because the local board had no power to act in contravention of a local government land use plan except in specific circumstances, and following specific procedures, prescribed by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted and sentenced for 15 counts of drug-related offenses. Appellant argued that his convictions in count 16, delivery of cocaine and count 18, trafficking delivery of cocaine, violated the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy because they punished the same crime. The court affirmed 14 counts against the appellant, remanded the trial court to strike appellant's conviction and sentence for count 16, and ordered reconsideration any sentences in which appellant was entitled to resentencing. Delivery of cocaine required a knowing intent to deliver cocaine, and trafficking delivery of cocaine required a knowing intent to deliver more than 28 but less than 200 grams of cocaine. Because the quantity element did not constitute a separate element for purposes of double jeopardy analysis, neither offense required proof of an additional element. Accordingly, the two separate convictions violated the double jeopardy clause. Appellant, who was sentenced pursuant to sentencing guidelines amended by 1995 Fla. Law ch. 184, which was held unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. III &sect; 6, was entitled to reconsideration of his sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of battery on a law enforcement officer, resisting an officer with violence, and resisting an officer without violence, challenged his battery sentence on the grounds that the Fla. Stat. ch. 778.084 (1997) habitual felony offender enhancement of it was double jeopardy. An earlier case held that because the crime of battery on a law enforcement officer was an enhancement of the crime of battery, it was wrong to impose an enhancement again by increasing one's sentence as a repeat offender. The court affirmed and certified conflict with that earlier decision. Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 on repeat offenders was analogous to Fla. Stat. ch. 812.014(3)(c) because they shared a similar classification and sentencing procedure; thus misdemeanor battery became a felony if perpetrated on a law enforcement officer, and repeat offenders received even harsher punishment, which was not an unconstitutional double punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurer and its insured had a policy, which required arbitration of any claims dispute involving medical benefits. Respondent medical provider entered into an assignment of benefits with the insured, and then respondent sued petitioner for payment. Petitioner moved to compel arbitration. The county court denied the motion. On appeal, the circuit court affirmed the denial, and concluded that while the mandatory provision of Fla. Stat. &sect; 627.736(5)(c) did not deny medical providers access to the court, it violated the due process and equal protection rights of medical providers. Petitioner then requested a writ of certiorari. Petitioner argued that it was an error to decline arbitration to a category of disputes that had been held arbitrable. The court denied the writ of certiorari. The court held that the mandatory arbitration provision of Fla. Stat. &sect; 627.736(5) violated the right of medical providers to access the courts. Because the statute did not provide for a trial, the limited review and the conclusiveness attached to the arbitration award without the right of a trial diminished the right to have the ultimate decision in a case made by a court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, parishioner and student, appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Dade County (Florida), dismissing their claims against defendants, church and archdiocese, for negligent hiring and supervision, respondeat superior, and breach of implied contract arising from their sexual assault by defendant's priest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, parishioner and student, alleged that they were sexually assaulted by their priest while working at defendant church. Plaintiffs filed suit against defendant church and defendant archdiocese for negligent hiring and supervision, respondeat superior, and breach of implied contract. Defendants moved to dismiss the claims on grounds that they were barred by U.S. Const. amend. I. The motion was granted, and plaintiffs appealed. The court noted there was a split of opinion throughout the country as to whether a religious institution could be held liable for these types of claims. The court concluded, however, that applying neutral principles of law to the secular conduct of a religious institution was not a violation of U.S. Const. amend. I. Given plaintiffs' factual allegations, that defendants retained the priest and allowed him to supervise plaintiffs after they knew the priest had committed several sexual assaults or batteries, the court concluded that the issue of defendants' liability had to be determined in court under tort law. The judgment was reversed and remanded, and plaintiffs' case was reinstated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded and the case was reinstated. Plaintiffs alleged priests' secular misconduct did not require inquiry into religious doctrine, and applying neutral principles of law to defendants' secular conduct was not constitutionally impermissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction and sentence from the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) for first-degree murder, armed burglary of a dwelling, and armed robbery, arguing the trial court's jury instruction on premeditated first-degree murder was fundamental error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder, armed burglary of a dwelling, and armed robbery. At trial, the jury was instructed on both premeditated and felony murder theories and appellant's counsel raised no objections to the instructions. Appellant was convicted and challenged the verdict, arguing the trial court erred in charging the jury with the premeditated first-degree murder instruction and in imposing his sentence. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, holding the instruction on premeditated first-degree murder was not fundamental error and, if error was committed, it did not affect appellant's substantial rights. The court remanded the matter for the trial court to reconsider appellant's sentence because he was sentenced under the unconstitutional 1995 Florida sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Affirmed in part, remanded in part, because the trial court did not err in giving an instruction on premeditated first-degree murder and, even if it had, it did not affect appellant's substantial rights. The court remanded for a reconsideration of appellant's sentence because he was sentenced under unconstitutional sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>
