</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, residents and taxpayers, brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-51(b) was unconstitutional on its face as applied by defendant board of education. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-51(b) essentially required each member town to make payments to the district based on the number of pupils enrolled in the district. Plaintiffs alleged that while the amount each town was required to pay to the district per student pursuant to &sect; 10-51(b) was the same, the result was a much greater tax burden upon residents of their town. Rejecting plaintiffs' contention, the court dismissed the action on defendant's motion. The issued raised by plaintiffs were non-justiciable political questions. The plaintiffs made no claim as to the adequacy of the educational opportunity but only questioned the sources of the funding. Accordingly, the questions cast by the plaintiffs as equal protection claims were questions for lawmakers, not judges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that individual defendants, police detectives, their supervisors, and the town, failed to act to protect plaintiff's decedent from a man who was threatening him. Plaintiff asserted claims based on negligence, violation of due process, failure to supervise, and indemnity. Defendants moved to strike all eight of the claims in plaintiff's amended complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mentally ill man who had been threatening him killed plaintiff's decedent. Individual defendants had been made aware of the man's threats, but the decedent was informed that there was nothing defendants could do and that the decedent was not in any real danger. After the decedent was killed, plaintiff sued. Defendants moved to strike plaintiff's claims. The court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. Regarding her negligence and failure to supervise claims and the associated indemnity claims, plaintiff alleged facts sufficient to trigger application of the &quot;identifiable person--imminent harm&quot; exception to the governmental immunity doctrine. With respect to those claims, the court denied the motion to strike. However, plaintiff's due process claim was not valid, nor was the indemnity claim associated with it. With respect to those claims, the motion to strike was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Motion to strike was granted in part and denied in part. Plaintiff stated facts sufficient to support her negligence and failure to supervise claims and the associated indemnity claims. However, because alternative remedies existed, plaintiff had no private due process claim. The court struck that claim and the indemnity claim associated with it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss a charge against him alleging a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278(b), the controlled substances law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While working a private job at a club, a police officer observed defendant engage in a conversation with another male and female. In exchange for money, defendant handed the male a small item defendant had retrieved from a multi-colored pouch he had stuffed in his pants. Defendant recognized the officer and attempted to mix into a large crowd. Defendant fled up the stairs of the club still holding the pouch in his hand. The officer, never losing sight of defendant, observed him throw the pouch around a corner of the wall. Inside the pouch were two white pills, and from the floor the officer recovered 22 identical pills each marked with an &quot;E&quot; on top. A search revealed $ 993 in currency from defendant's pant pocket. The pills were &quot;Ecstasy,&quot; which contained a controlled substance. In his motion to dismiss, defendant argued &quot;Ecstasy&quot; was not a narcotic substance or hallucinogenic substance within the meaning of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278(b). Motion to dismiss was denied. The relevant regulations and statutes afforded a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know that &quot;Ecstasy&quot; was a controlled substance and prohibited within the provisions of &sect; 21a-278(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to dismiss was denied; even though the drug defendant was accused of selling was not specifically named as a controlled substance in the relevant state statute, because the drug sold contained a specifically scheduled controlled substance, the drug sold was a controlled substance within the meaning of the applicable statutes and regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought damages from the State of Connecticut under a theory of inverse condemnation without just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimed the State did not substantially advance a legitimate state interest by asserting that two parcels of land could not be returned to the sewer district once they were removed in 1991. The State did not target plaintiff's properties for removal from the sewer district, but acting pursuant to statutory and regulatory authority, sought to have a long-term plan for a wastewater treatment facility. The State acted to substantially advance a legitimate state interest. Plaintiff did not demonstrate that he was deprived of reasonable alternative uses for either property, or that any diminution in value resulted. Establishment of a conservation zone was clearly a legitimate governmental concern, and there was a proportionality between the action and the impact. Court did not find plaintiff's expert's methodology to be a reliable indicator of plaintiff's damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner petroleum products middleman appealed respondent Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Revenue Services' determination that it was liable for payment of the gross earnings tax on sale of petroleum products, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-587, and imposing a penalty, arguing that the statute aimed only at major oil companies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner middleman bought petroleum products out of state for distribution in Connecticut. Respondent taxing agency assessed the gross earnings tax on sale of petroleum products under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-587, and petitioner sought review. The court agreed with petitioner that the original statute aimed only at major oil companies. However, when the statute was amended after constitutional problems surfaced, the definition of those liable clearly included a taxpayer such as petitioner. Because petitioner raised this issue of first impression in good faith, no penalty was appropriate. Respondent's adjustment of the amount due did not cause its first determination of liability to lapse. Finally, petitioner did not have to prepay its tax in order to challenge the assessment, because this was a challenge to the amount assessed pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-597 rather than a challenge to the statute's constitutionality under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-600.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld imposition of tax, but determined that petitioner's challenge did not warrant a penalty. While the original statute focused on major oil companies, petitioner's activities clearly fell within the statute as amended. Because it challenged the amount assessed, petitioner did not have to pay tax to seek review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant objected to a hearing on damages, resulting from its violations of the Connecticut Franchise Act, Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant violated the Connecticut Franchise Act (CFA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-133e et seq., and Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110a et seq., and the court issued an injunction prohibiting defendant from terminating its franchise with plaintiff. The court set a hearing to determine damages. Defendant objected. The court concluded: (1) the CFA was a statutory action that did not entitle plaintiff to a jury trial and the manner in which plaintiff pleaded its CFA count made it an equitable claim; (2) respecting both the CFA and CUTPA, plaintiff waived the right to a jury trial by: (a) its counsel's silence concerning defense counsel's letter stating the agreement that plaintiff's counsel had expressly waived a jury trial on the statutory counts; (b) its counsel's conduct indicating concurrence with that agreement by assent to a hearing on damages on the statutory counts in order to expedite the interlocutory appeal, and by moving for counsel fees under the CFA; and (c) its counsel admitting in open court that the court could hear damages on the statutory counts, having the effect of a written waiver of jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's statutory action did not entitle it to a jury trial and the manner in which plaintiff pleaded its count made it an equitable claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff motorcycle driver collided with a tree limb and branches that protruded into the travel lane of a public road, causing him to lose control of the motorcycle, which fell to the ground, resulting in serious injuries to both himself and plaintiff passenger. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants allowed the limb and branches to protrude across the road, which affected visibility and safe passage, thereby creating a dangerous condition; failed to inspect the tree and shrub growth; failed to warn plaintiffs of the condition; and failed to remedy the unsafe condition. Defendants filed a special defense to the effect that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 23-59, 23-65 removed their obligation to care for, trim, or prune any limbs or branches overhanging a public road. The court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. Even though the tree and/or shrub may have stood on defendants' property, the statutes in question vested the care and control, indeed, the exclusive control, of limbs or branches extending over a public road with the municipal tree warden. The statutes validly absolved defendants of any claims of negligence or nuisance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorney filed an independent action challenging the merits of a final decision to suspend his license to practice law. Plaintiff either did raise or could have raised all issues during the original grievance proceeding before the defendant grievance committee, during the presentment before the trial court, or on appeal to the court. The complaint was an apparent effort to attack the final judgment suspending his license. Defendant was an agent of the state and was immune from suit for damages. The plaintiff had not alleged that the defendant had acted in excess of its statutory authority or pursuant to an unconstitutional state statute. The state legislature had not waived the immunity of defendant, and defendant had not otherwise consented to a suit for damages. The doctrine of sovereign immunity therefore afforded the defendant absolute protection from the plaintiff's suit, and the defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Plaintiff's claim was also barred by the doctrines of absolute quasi-judicial immunity and res judicata.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a motion to strike defendant's first, second, ninth, eleventh, twenty-second, twenty-ninth, and forty-second special defenses on the ground that plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted in their products liability and negligence claims against defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed asbestos and asbestos related products manufactured, sold, and distributed by defendants caused the injuries, illnesses, and disabilities of plaintiffs. Defendant filed an answer and special defenses in response to plaintiffs' allegations. Defendant failed to allege facts that demonstrated plaintiff had no cause of action because the negligence of the plaintiff could diminish, but did not bar, the recovery of damages. Comparative negligence could not be specially pled in a product liability action because this special defense did not demonstrate that the plaintiffs had no cause of action. Defendant's special defense did not properly allege facts that showed plaintiffs knowingly and voluntarily used a defective product. The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 933, gave a person entitled to compensation two avenues of recovery. Therefore, the plaintiffs' claims were not barred by the application of this act. Defendants failed to allege facts that demonstrated plaintiffs had no cause of action because privity of contract was not required in a product liability case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment action seeking determination that one of defendant's zoning regulations, imposing restrictions on sloping land, was unconstitutionally void for vagueness and not reasonably related to the health, safety, morals, or welfare of the public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owned real property which it subdivided into lots beginning in 1988. Also in 1988, defendant planning and zoning commission placed restrictions on steep slopes in determining minimum lot area and size. In 1996, plaintiff sought to re-subdivide one lot into two. Defendant denied the application, partly because neither lot, having steep slopes, would have met minimum area requirements. Plaintiff then sued defendant for a declaratory judgment that the relevant zoning regulation did not meet the standards of the Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, or U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because it was vague and not reasonably related to public health, safety, morals, or welfare. Plaintiff argued the regulation was void for vagueness in defining &quot;slope.&quot; The court found the zoning regulation was not unconstitutionally vague and was rationally related to a legitimate planning goal. It therefore dismissed plaintiff's appeal of defendant's denial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's appeal was dismissed, as the zoning regulation was not unconstitutionally vague merely because there were different ways to measure slope. A 25 percent slope was not a standardless calculation. The regulation was also rationally related to a legitimate planning goal regarding run-off.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff planning commission and zoning enforcement officer sought review of a decision of defendant zoning board of appeals that granted a variance from setback and parking requirements to defendant applicants. Plaintiffs argued that defendants failed to show hardship and defendants argued that plaintiffs were not aggrieved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant applicants received a setback and parking regulation variance from defendant local zoning board (board). Plaintiffs land use planning commission (commission) and zoning enforcement officer sought review of board's action. The court held that under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(a), plaintiff commission was clearly an entity that could seek review as a party aggrieved by a zoning board action. Since plaintiffs had standing, the court then reviewed the administrative record. Noting that grants of variances were reserved for exceptional circumstances, it held that defendant applicants had the burden to show that their proposed variance would not substantially affect the comprehensive zoning plan and that strict adherence to the ordinance would cause unnecessary and unusual hardship. A variance that increased the area's strip mall character would certainly affect the commission's plan, but, more importantly, defendant applicants never established that they would suffer hardship, only inconvenience.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the variance grant. Plaintiffs were aggrieved parties because violations of their land use plans were their concern by statute. The record indicated considerable disruption to plaintiffs' plan would occur and, furthermore, defendants failed to show hardship would result from failure to grant variance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his arrest, plaintiff sued in a 13-count complaint alleging he was injured by several state troopers and denied medical care. Defendant state moved to dismiss on the grounds of sovereign immunity and failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Since some of the defendants were state officials, claims against them were in effect claims against the state. Plaintiff's complaint did not rise to the level needed to remove the shield of sovereign immunity. Therefore, sovereign immunity barred the complaint against defendants in their official capacities and were dismissed. Likewise, the complaint did not rise to the level necessary to overcome statutory immunity for defendants in their individual capacities. Those claims were dismissed. Plaintiff had also failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by failing to wait for the claims commissioner to act. Under state statute, the claims commissioner could waive sovereign immunity.

The court found that the state lands where hunting is allowed are not public fora and that Connecticut General Statutes Sec. 53a-183a is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the Connecticut Supreme Court for an evidentiary hearing, the court was to determine whether public parks where hunting was permissible were traditional public fora, nontraditional public fora, or non-public fora as well as the nature and interest of the public interest served by the Connecticut Hunter Harassment Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-183a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, anti-hunting activists, were arrested for interfering with a hunter who was attempting to legally hunt for deer. They were charged with violations of the Connecticut Hunter Harassment Act (Act), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-183a. They then challenged the constitutionality of the Act, claiming it violated their U.S. Const. amend. I rights. On remand from the Connecticut Supreme Court, the court determined that state lands where hunting was allowed were not public fora and the Act was narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest. Hunting was a nontraditional use in state parks. The use of state forests and parks for nontraditional activities required supervision in light of the safety issues involved. The impact on the natural environment was an important consideration for the Department of Environmental Protection in allowing a special permit or in policing the areas when a use was occurring without a permit. Thus, they were non-public fora. The restrictions were limited to the governmental interest of managing wildlife and securing revenues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the state lands where hunting was allowed were not public fora and the Connecticut Hunter Harassment Act was narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a third amended request for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-466, Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8, 9, and U.S. Const. amend. VI, XIV, after his conviction of and incarceration for murder, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, denial of a fair trial in violation of due process, and that he was actually innocent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of murder based upon eyewitness identification testimony of petitioner at a restaurant and at and running from the murder scene outside the restaurant. Petitioner's alibi that he was at the work release residence at the time of the shooting was discredited. Petitioner's third amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, thirteen years after being charged with the crime, was dismissed. Both Strickland test prongs were relied upon to find no ineffective assistance of trial counsel on issues including proper investigation, cross-examination, making objections, and preserving issues for appeal. The deceased counsel's performance did not undermine the proper functioning of the adversarial process so the trial could not be relied upon to provide a just result. Photo identification procedures were not unduly suggestive. There was no prosecution misconduct. The arrest warrant was issued on probable cause. Defendant failed to prove Brady violations, that one violation was material, and that his left-handedness was Brady material. The jury was properly charged as a whole as to their role to find facts. Defendant did not prove freestanding actual innocence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was dismissed. The habeas court found no prosecutorial misconduct, withholding of Brady materials, defense counsel ineffective assistance, freestanding actual innocence, and unduly suggestive photo identification. The jury was properly instructed and the arrest warrant was issued for probable cause. No error was found relating to eyewitness identifications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners' writs of habeas corpus were consolidated as they all alleged U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10-prohibited ex post facto application of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-125a(b) (amended 1995) to them, though they had committed their offenses prior to its effective date, which prohibited parole hearings for them until they served 85 percent of their sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners committed manslaughter and robbery prior to the effective date of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-125a(b) (as amended by 1995 Conn. Acts 255, &sect; 1). Petitioners were convicted the dates their guilty pleas were accepted, after its effective date. The law in effect at the time of their offenses required them to serve a minimum of 50 percent of their definite sentences. The Parole Board found that under &sect; 54-125a(b) (as amended by 1995 Conn. Acts 255, &sect; 1), petitioners were not eligible for parole hearings until they had served 85 percent of their sentences. Petitioners sought habeas relief alleging U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 ex post facto violations, which the court granted. 1995 Conn. Acts 255 was a penal statute because its legislative history showed it was intended to keep certain offenders in prison longer. Petitioners deserved notice of the 85 percent requirement at the time of their offenses rather than at the time of their pleas. Taking away Board discretion to grant earlier parole hearings, by mandating 85 percent sentence-service, constituted a significant risk of increased punishment (35 percent), even though petitioners were not entitled to parole at all.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Writs were granted. Respondent warden was ordered to recalculate petitioners' parole eligibility dates according to statute as it existed at time offenses occurred. Parole Board was ordered not to restrict itself to a mandatory minimum service of 85 percent of petitioners' sentences in determining their parole eligibility since that constituted a significant risk of increased punishment to petitioners, of which they had not had notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Statewide Grievance Committee, filed a complaint against respondent attorney for failing to comply with two restitution orders imposed in connection with grievance complaints filed by two of respondent's clients. The committee dismissed the grievance complaints but ordered restitution to the clients. Respondent filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, alleging the committee lacked jurisdiction to issue the restitution order absent a finding of misconduct, and thus the court also lacked jurisdiction. The court denied the motion, holding it did have jurisdiction over matters regarding attorney discipline and under the Connecticut General Practice Book. Respondent also filed a motion to strike, based on legal insufficiency, which the court granted, holding petitioner could not impose restitution absent a finding of misconduct by respondent, as doing so was a deprivation of property without due process of law. The scheme of attorney regulation could not operate in violation of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was denied, as court had jurisdiction over grievance matters, but motion to strike amended petition was granted, because respondent's alleged failure to comply with petitioner's restitution order, imposed without a finding of misconduct, could not be basis of presentment action and violated due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff allegedly had an agreement whereby defendants, a state operated hospital and some of its employees, would allow one of their patients who was confined for psychiatric reasons to have temporary leave in order to work for plaintiff.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a denial without prejudice by the defendant Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Kent, Connecticut of plaintiff's subdivision application, because it did not include a provision for open space as allowed under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8.25 and Town of Kent, Conn., Subdivision Reg. &sect; 3.8, and because the driveway and homesite locations violated other provisions of those regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's application to subdivide land within the town was denied without prejudice by defendant town planning and zoning commission. Defendant's reasons for denial included failure of the subdivision to provide for open space as allowed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8.25 and Town of Kent, Conn., Subdivision Reg. &sect; 3.8, and because the driveway and homesite locations violated Town of Kent, Conn., Subdivision Reg. &sect; 3.16.1. The denial was sustained and the appeal was dismissed based upon the open space issue. Defendant had relied upon a report from its engineering consultant submitted after the public hearing was closed. Therefore, defendant's denial based upon violations of other regulatory provisions could not have been upheld. However, defendant was authorized by &sect; 8.25 and &sect; 3.16.1 to require open spaces deemed proper even though requirements were not specifically set forth in either section, or, after questioning by plaintiff at the hearing, defined at the hearing.

He argued that Conn. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lost his position as a prosecutor after defendant, his former girlfriend, accused him of stalking her. After losing in an arbitration of his termination pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, he sued defendant for defamation and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, based on two groups of statements made to his employer and others, three years apart. The court held that all actions based on the first group of statements were time-barred, because applicable statutes of limitations had run. Defendant's claim that statements in the second group were absolutely privileged depended on whether the arbitration in connection with which they were made was a quasi-judicial proceeding. Since the arbitration in question involved exercise of many of the same powers and performance of the same functions as a court, it was quasi-judicial and the privilege attached.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's motion, because plaintiff's actions on earlier statements were barred by applicable statutes of limitations and defendant's later statements were made in or related to a quasi-judicial arbitration and therefore qualified for the absolute privilege extended to statements made relative to judicial proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff fell and injured herself in a casino. Defendant director was the director of facilities for the Native American tribal gaming authority. Defendant official was a building official for the tribe. The two defendant individuals claimed the tribe had not waived sovereign immunity and the immunity extended to officials and employees of the tribe for actions within the scope of their office or employment. The tribe was not a party to the action. Individual tribal members could not have asserted tribal sovereign immunity. Plaintiff did not claim defendant individuals were tribal officials representing the tribal government. Rather, plaintiff's allegations established that they were employees of the tribe or the gaming authority, who were acting within the scope of their employment. Tribal sovereign immunity did not extend to employees acting in a nongovernmental capacity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee worked for defendant employer. Because of various injuries, plaintiff applied for disability pension benefits from defendant. Physicians found that his disabilities rendered him incapable of performing job duties or any other work and that he would not likely be able to recover from his injuries. Plaintiff filed his disability application and the Board of Retirement (Board) awarded plaintiff a pension benefit at a percentage rate of 50 percent of his earnings. Plaintiff appealed the award, alleging the Board acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion when it awarded him the disability pension at a lower percentage rate than the collective bargain agreement rate. The reviewing court dismissed plaintiff's appeal, since there was no evidence that the same award criteria was not applied in other cases or that the award was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 54-250 was later adopted to require certain felons, such as petitioner, to give DNA samples and to submit to certain personal identification and registration procedures. Petitioner claimed these requirement violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV, Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Petitioner's habeas request was denied and his petition was dismissed. Petitioner had provided a blood sample in exchange for respondent prison warden expunging a prior disciplinary ticket, so the claim that taking the blood sample violated certain rights was moot. Respondent's rights were not affected by the sex registration statute since respondent was not required to obtain the information from a prisoner unconditionally released. Under the statute the Connecticut Department of Safety and not respondent had virtually all the responsibility for data collection for registration. Data did not have to be collected until the prisoner was released. The assumption was made that petitioner would serve his entire sentence and would then be subject to unconditional release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant board of education voted both to expel plaintiff student for allegedly threatening a fellow student with a knife and not to provide alternative education for plaintiff student. Plaintiffs, the student and his parents, appealed defendant board's decision. The court held that plaintiffs received adequate notice of the expulsion hearing. However, to the extent that the findings reached by defendant board were dependent upon the police sergeant's testimony concerning statements made to him by the alleged victim and a witness, they could not be sustained. This was because the police sergeant refused to identify the witness or the victim, or to provide copies of statements, even in redacted form, rendering any attempt at meaningful cross-examination futile. Furthermore, the decision to expel plaintiff student could not be sustained because the record failed to support the finding by defendant board that plaintiff student was not a child requiring special education and related services. Consequently, plaintiffs' appeal was sustained, and plaintiff student's expulsion was ordered expunged from his record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife and defendant husband signed a separation agreement in 1989 that stated defendant would pay child support until their child was emancipated, married, or 18 years old.

Stat. &sect; 46b-84(b), which required support through high school or 19 years of age in dissolution cases filed after July 1994, violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, since it applied only to children of divorces that took place after that date. The rational basis test was the appropriate standard of review. If &sect; 46b-84(b) was applied retroactively, the courts would be consumed by requests for extended support.

Plaintiff moved to dismiss the motion for lack of jurisdiction. The court held that Conn. Gen.

Stat. &sect; 46b-56(a) expressly conferred upon the court the authority to grant visitation to an intervening grandparent in such a case. The court held that case law relied on by plaintiff did not apply to the instant case. Plaintiff had opened herself and the children to such intrusion in the custody proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant high sheriff possessed a weapon qualifying as an assault weapon long before possession by all except those specifically exempted was outlawed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-202c. The gun was seized from his office and he was charged with the felony. He argued that he came within the exception for police officers, Department of Public Safety officers, corrections officers, and military personnel. The court, reading the plain language of the statute, held that the legislature's failure to use the broader term, peace officer, was significant, and refused to broaden the statutory exception. The court declined to insert a requirement for mens rea into the statutory definition of an offense where conduct was proscribed to protect public safety. Finally, defendant raised constitutional objections such as vagueness, right to bear arms, ex post facto and bill of attainder, and separation of powers, but the statute had already been ruled constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The natural father challenged the court's finding and argued that Troxel held that non-parental visitation statutes violated the due process clause as a per se matter. The court rejected that argument. The court held that Troxel did not hold that non-parental visitation statutes violated the due process clause as a per se matter. The court reasoned that the United States Supreme Court stated that &quot;as applied&quot; the Washington statute was unconstitutional. The court concluded that the third party visitation statute's,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46b-59, application must be tempered by both Troxel and a similar case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner received two concurrent sentences, one carrying good time and one not. He challenged respondent warden's calculation of his release date by habeas corpus petition. The court dismissed the count alleging that respondent incorrectly applied Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-38, holding that he correctly separately calculated release dates for each sentence and then selected the later date as petitioner's effective release date. However, petitioner raised an issue of fact that required a hearing when he alleged that his guilty plea was induced by a promise that the sentence that allowed for good time would be the controlling one for purposes of calculating statutory good time and release date, so respondent's motion was denied as to that count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted respondent's motion on first count, because respondent applied the statute correctly as a matter of law, but denied it on second count, because there was a question of fact whether petitioner pled guilty in exchange for the promise that his release date would be calculated differently.</SPAN></P>

The court first found that plaintiff planning and zoning commission and plaintiff zoning enforcement officer were statutory aggrieved persons under Conn. Gen.

Defendant board had statutory authority to grant variances unrestricted by local zoning ordinance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town and defendant selectman moved for summary judgment as to counts three and seven of plaintiffs' complaint. Count three alleged that it was brought pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7-101, 7-465, 10-240, and common law negligence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were parents of a high school student who was given after school detention. No teacher came to the detention, so the students went out to the school's ball field, and one of them raped plaintiff's daughter. Plaintiffs then filed suit against several defendants, including defendant town and defendant town selectman. Governmental immunity barred the claims alleging violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-240 and common law negligence because they failed to allege a statutory right of action that abrogated immunity. Because plaintiffs' daughter was not a foreseeable victim to defendant selectman, governmental immunity applied to his discretionary acts. Defendant selectman did not owe a duty of care to schoolchildren for acts concerning control and supervision at a high school.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant accused sought a finding that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-46a was unconstitutional by moving the court to preclude juror death qualification. The court denied the motion, finding the statute to be constitutional. The court determined that the statute did not fail to designate a single human sentencing authority and that it contained an unrestrictaed set of mitigating factors. The court found that the mitigating factors under the statute allowed flexibility based on the particular defendant and the particular crime. The court concluded that the sentencer would make the required moral and individualized determination because it would consider a nonexclusive list of mitigating factors as well as a catchall category consisting of any other mitigating factor concerning the defendant's character, background, and history, or the nature and circumstances of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant individual conveyed property to defendant historical commission, with the condition that a historical building be restored and turned in to a museum. Plaintiffs sought a temporary and permanent injunction precluding any development of the property until defendants received zoning permits. Plaintiffs argued a right of way across their land would be overburdened, and their property would be substantially devalued by the close proximity to the museum. Defendant historical society moved to dismiss. The court held defendant was protected by sovereign immunity. The court held plaintiffs failed to show a violation of Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1, as plaintiff were not attacking any act of the legislature, nor did the facts show an absence of a legitimate public purpose. The court held defendant did not exceed its statutory authority under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 10-321d, 4b-22. The statutes allowed defendant to purchase or obtain by gift historic structures, and restore those structures and open them for public visitation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As police officer trained rookie, they made point, for practice purposes, of stopping cars whenever they saw violations. After they stopped defendant for unlit license plate, they detected signs of intoxication and arrested him. The court held evidence of intoxication gathered during stop was admissible in drunk driving trial, because stop was proper at time. Defendant was clearly violating minor traffic law. Officers' detection of alcohol odor and slurred speech furnished reasonable and articulable suspicion that supported further detention for sobriety testing. With discrediting of earlier doctrine of pretextual stops, motor vehicle stops generally did not violate constitutional norms regardless of officers' subjective intent, as long as they had objectively justifiable basis. The court noted, however, that even if doctrine had been applied, officers' reasoning in stopping more minor lawbreakers than usual in course of training exercise would not have been improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to suppress, because there was no question defendant was violating equipment statute at time of stop, and because evidence showed that stop for minor violation occurred because one officer was in training, not as pretext for improper purpose.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motion to dismiss was denied. The one-year misdemeanor statute of limitations on the continuing violation had not run, because the action was filed three days after the remedial period expired. The court had subject matter jurisdiction, because abatement orders have a prospective application, to protect the public from future exposure. Denial of jurisdiction would therefore be against public policy. It therefore did not matter that there was no child under six years old living in the property at any time defendant owned the property. The court had personal jurisdiction, because defendant knowingly and willingly purchased the premises with notice of the existence of toxic levels of lead in the paint and with the notice that the property was subject to an abatement order from the city health division.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed the decision of defendant, the Planning Board of the City of Stamford (Connecticut), denying her application to subdivide the real property because the subject property had outstanding zoning violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was an aggrieved party who had standing to bring an appeal because she owned the property that defendant refused to allow her to subdivide. The record reflected that the subject property had outstanding zoning violations. Consequently, the zoning violations were inherent in the subdivision plan because the subject property itself had outstanding zoning violations. The subject property had existing, not potential, violations of zoning regulations. Therefore, defendant lacked the authority pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-26 to approve the subdivision plan because the plan conflicted with applicable zoning regulations. Accordingly, defendant did not act in an arbitrary manner in denying the plaintiff's application. The Stamford subdivision regulations provided the planning board with authority to disapprove the plaintiff's application because of outstanding zoning violations. Therefore, plaintiff's application to subdivide her real property was properly denied. Plaintiff could not challenge the constitutionality of the subdivision regulations while appealing defendant's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appeal dismissed; defendant planning board properly dismissed plaintiff's application to subdivide her real property because defendant lacked the authority under state statute to approve the subdivision because there were current, outstanding zoning violations.

I, &sect;&sect; 7, 8, 9, 10, and U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV. The court held that &sect; 46b-38c was constitutional because defendant's substantive due process rights, procedural due process rights, and equal protection rights were not violated. The court denied dismissal of the order and the information because dismissing the information would be too drastic, defendant was no longer barred from returning to his residence, restricting cross-examination of wife did not prejudice defendant, and defendant's rights under &sect; 46b-38c were not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved the court to dismiss the protective order issued against him on behalf of his wife after he had been summonsed for disorderly conduct and an initial report, pursuant to Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was summonsed by police for disorderly conduct, a Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-182 violation, while at the residence he shared with his wife. The state requested the court issue a protective order for defendant's wife, the court referred defendant to a family violence intervention officer for an initial report pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-38c, and a protective order issued, later modified to permit defendant to return to his residence. Defendant moved to dismiss, alleging due process, equal protection, and &sect; 46b-38c violations. The court denied his motion. Section 46b-38c's legislative history showed its provision for restricting liberty was to protect victims, not punish defendant; thus the court employed the substantive due process &quot;rational basis&quot; test. Defendant's report statements were confidential and the report not to be used in criminal prosecution. Defendant's wife's &quot;victim&quot; designation did not impair the presumption of his innocence. Defendant had received a full adversarial hearing, and the summons and report were sufficient to let the court find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the protective order should issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Motion was denied. Defendant's due process and other rights had not been violated since the statute's intent was to protect victims, a report on him was confidential and not to be used in criminal prosecution, and defendant's wife's &quot;victim&quot; designation did not impair the presumption of his innocence.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. 49-8 and 49-51. The court found that as to the second cause of action, compliance with the explicit terms of Conn. Gen. Stat. 49-51 was such a strict requirement that it implicated the court's jurisdiction so unless the judgment debtor could show he complied with the statute's terms, the court lacked jurisdiction. As to the third claim, the court found the allegations under CUTPA could not be made against the judgment creditor because it was a corporation and not a governmental body.</SPAN></P>

Although the court made all required findings of fact to approve the sale, it declined to approve transfer because there was no reason to suppose the legislature intended the act to unconstitutionally impair the right to contract, so declaratory judgment approval was only available to payees whose contracts did not forbid transfer of rights.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the motion as to CUTPA and the Anti-Trust Act. The court held neither statute included the state in definitions of a &quot;person&quot; who could be held liable. Because neither statute specifically bound the state, sovereign immunity barred the claims. The court denied the motion to dismiss on the violation of franchise rights claim. The Cable Communications Policy Act, 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 52, specifically included a state in its definition of a &quot;person.&quot; Therefore, sovereign immunity did not apply.

The court found plaintiff failed overcome the presumption that the administrative agency member, acting in an adjudicative capacity, was not biased. The court held the challenged regulation represented a legitimate exercise of police powers, given the ages of the children involved, the potential for abuse, and the total dependence of children on the day care provider for extended periods of time.

The court found defendant had before it all relevant information needed to determine an equitable disability pension for plaintiff. Defendant allowed plaintiff and his counsel at several meetings to provide additional information material to support a higher pension. The court held defendant properly reviewed the additional materials and concluded that the original pension awarded was equitable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Commissioner of Transportation of the State of Connecticut filed a motion, based on the court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction, to dismiss plaintiff landowner's complaint alleging an unconstitutional taking under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, landowners, filed a takings claim under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 related to defendant Commissioner of Transportation of the State of Connecticut's plans to build a highway that would cut off plaintiffs' access to the south portion of their property and which created zoning regulations related to the highway project. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, arguing sovereign immunity as a defense and that their highway project was not certain enough to substantiate a taking claim. The court found sovereign immunity did not apply to unconstitutional taking claims. Also, since defendant filed maps, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. 13a-57, which deemed the area to have been legally laid out as a state highway, announced it would take plaintiff's property to build the highway, and enforced the proposed taking through local zoning regulations, defendant proceeded beyond the mere planning stages and its actions could sustain a taking claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion, finding that defendant's planned highway construction was sufficiently beyond the preparation stages to sustain plaintiff's takings claim of action where the proposed highway was on filed maps and required zoning that deprived plaintiffs of the use of their property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon transfer of two cases to the Superior Court of Connecticut, Complex Litigation Docket, involving plaintiff cities' diversion of water from river along which defendants, towns and a trust, owned land held in trust. Plaintiffs sought declaration that such diversion was not violative of a contract entered into 76 years prior, and that it was not an impairment of a public trust in a natural resource in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cities and defendants towns and a trust filed suit against one another seeking a declaration that diversion of water from a river along which defendants owned land held in trust was not violative of a contract entered into 76 years prior and that such use was not an impairment of a public trust in a natural resource in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-16, and injunctive relief to end such use, respectively. The cases were merged and transferred to the Superior Court of Connecticut Complex Litigation Docket. The court found that defendants proved that the manner in which plaintiff city operated its diversion and the limitations that its operations imposed on the flow of water constituted an unreasonable impairment of a public trust in a natural resource, substantially impairing the natural flow of the river, but that such use did not rise to the level of nuisance. The court also found that feasible and prudent alternatives were available to plaintiffs that would not unreasonably impair the public trust in the river. Declaratory relief and injunctive relief were awarded to plaintiffs and defendants, respectively, and no contractual relief was awarded other plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs awarded relief declaring that diversion of river water was not nuisance, and relief ordered in favor of defendants enjoining plaintiffs from diverting water in the contested manner, which was found to constitute an unreasonable impairment of a public trust in a natural resource. No relief based on contract awarded to other plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
