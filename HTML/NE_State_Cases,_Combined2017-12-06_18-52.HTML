Stat. &sect; 28-1212.04 (Reissue 2016) was facially unconstitutional, because a final conviction and sentence entered upon an alleged facially unconstitutional statute was not absolutely void, but was voidable only, and could not be attacked in a habeas corpus proceeding; [2]-Habeas corpus was a collateral attack, and, therefore, habeas corpus was not a proper remedy to challenge a petitioner's detention pursuant to a final conviction and sentence on the basis that the statute underlying the conviction was unconstitutional; [3]-To the extent that In re Resler, 115 Neb. 335 (1927), and its progeny was inconsistent with the holding, the supreme court disapproved of it.</SPAN></P>

Although the managers may have been mistaken about the need for the measures taken, there was no indication that they acted with knowledge that the employee presented no danger on the day he was terminated or that they recklessly disregarded the truth.</SPAN></P>

However, the best solution was to modify the court's rules to limit the use of mandatory dues, or assessments, to the regulation of the legal profession. By limiting the use of mandatory assessments to the arena of regulation of the legal profession, the Bar Association will remain within the limits of the compelled-speech jurisprudence and avoid, in part, embroiling the supreme court and the legal profession in unending quarrels and litigation over the germaneness of an activity.</SPAN></P>

III, &sect; 18, even though it limited the availability of the tax credit to one taxpayer, because the Legislature had a reasonable basis for enacting the credit provision, namely to address a harsh and unfair consequence of its decision to change the law regarding taxation of property used for wind generation of electricity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants alleged that ordinance No. 1095 created special privileges and immunities, Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 18, for owner-occupied buildings because those dwellings were not subject to the ordinance's requirement. The tenants argued that the city lacked a reasonable basis for enacting an inspection program for residential properties that applied only to rental properties. The supreme court concluded that the record showed the city based its classification of rental property residences on a real distinction from other residential properties. It showed that the owners of rental properties could neglect necessary maintenance and repairs and that tenants could be reluctant to confront landlords or consult authorities about deteriorating conditions. The city's evidence of problems with residential rental properties was sufficient to justify its distinctive treatment of these properties. Intervention through the rental housing inspection program was clearly in the public's interest of maintaining safe housing for tenants and safe and livable neighborhoods for the city's residents.</SPAN></P>

The district court sustained the bank's motion for summary judgment, finding that the daughter's claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-227 (Reissue 2008). The reviewing court held that the daughter's claims were barred by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-227, and the district court did not err in entering summary judgment for the bank. The CD was not a negotiable instrument subject to Article 3 of Nebraska's Uniform Commercial Code. The CD matured on April 19, 1985, and the action was commenced over 24 years from the maturity date of the CD. The daughter had to commence her action either 7 years after the maturity date of the CD or 1 year after July 1, 2008. The daughter did not commence her action until November 30, 2009, and therefore, her claims were barred.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court held that the district court did not err in upholding the validity of both ordinances adopted by the city for the annexation of the district. As to ordinance 1107, the city did not undertake the annexation of the district solely for the purpose of obtaining revenue, and since the pre-1991 version of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1115 created no vested right, it created no contractual right. As to ordinance 1142, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-765 (Reissue 2008) did not void La Vista, Neb., Ordinance 1142. The purpose of the language in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-765 was simply to stay the effect of the proposed merger--here, the one effectuated by ordinance 1107--until a court could make a determination on the merits.</SPAN></P>

The District Court for Sarpy County, Nebraska, granted appellee city, mayor, and city council's motion to dismiss, finding that the action was barred by the general four-year statute of limitations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Resident alleged that the ordinance violated the Nebraska Constitution by paying for the costs through a general property tax levy and by granting a special benefit. The appellate court held that the question of the ordinance's constitutionality was not properly before the court because the resident's brief did not assign error in this regard. Although the resident filed a notice of a constitutional question, which asserted that a question of state unconstitutionality of the complained of city ordinances would necessarily be presented, his brief did not specifically assign that an ordinance was unconstitutional. Further, the appellate court could not determine whether the district court properly dismissed the action under Neb. Ct. R. Pleading Civ. Actions 6-1112(b)(6) because, although the four-year catchall limitations period set forth in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-212 (Cum. Supp. 2012) potentially applied to the action, the complaint did not disclose on its face that it was time barred when it did not disclose when the city, mayor, and city council made the decision choosing the specific funding mechanism to be used for the parking district or when they implemented that decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor argued that the district court erred by holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and erred in finding his misrepresentation causes of action were contract claims subject to and barred by the State Contract Claims Act (Act), Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81-8,302 et seq. (Reissue 2008). The supreme court noted it was not precluded from reviewing the affirmative defense of subject matter jurisdiction. The supreme court held that a misrepresentation cause of action was not a contract claim under the Act. The doctor's amended complaint prayed for the contract to be voided or rescinded and expunged from the record and did not request monetary damages. Therefore, the doctor's claim was not for money only and was not subject to the State Tort Claims Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81-8,209 et seq. (Reissue 2008 &amp; Cum. Supp. 2012). The rescission of the agreement of compliance between the doctor and Attorney General was at the discretion of the parties. Under the Uniform Credentialing Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-101 et seq. (Reissue 2008 &amp; Cum. Supp. 2012), the Attorney General's office had the authority to enter into an assurance of compliance with a medical professional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second-degree assault, use of a deadly weapon to commit a felony, and unlawful membership recruitment into an organization or association. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in rejecting his claim that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1351 (Cum. Supp. 2012) was constitutionally vague or overbroad or that it violated U.S. Const. amend. I. The acts for which defendant was charged clearly fell within the prohibition of &sect; 28-1351; hence, he did not have standing to assert a claim of constitutional vagueness. Further, there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction for violating &sect; 28-1351. The victim's testimony in itself was sufficient to show that defendant and his friends were an organization, group, enterprise, or association. Defendant's actions could have been seen as coercing, intimidating, or threatening the victim with the intent to entice him or join or to prevent him from leaving the organization. However, the trial court committed plain error when it failed to order that defendant's sentence for use of a deadly weapon be served consecutively to all other sentences, as required by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1205(3) (Cum. Supp. 2012).</SPAN></P>

Plain error review was inappropriate because the error was not plainly evident from the record. It could be inferred that the trial court impaneled a numbers jury and at the hearing on the motion to release juror information, defense counsel was not asking for the names of the jurors but simply wanted an opportunity to talk with the jurors and wanted the trial court's permission to release the names of the jurors. Thus, the record did not support a plain error review. Additionally, defendant waived any objection to the jury that was impaneled.

Stat. &sect; 84-215 (Reissue 2008), the Nebraska Attorney General filed an action to determine the constitutionality of Nebraska's Campaign Finance Limitation Act (CFLA), Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 32-1601 to -1613 (Reissue 2008 &amp; Supp. 2011). Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 84-215 charged the Nebraska Secretary of State with defending the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the U.S. Supreme Court declared an Arizona campaign finance statute to be unconstitutional, the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission (Commission) sought an opinion from the Attorney General as to the constitutionality of the CFLA. The Attorney General opined that the CFLA would likely be found unconstitutional by a court, and the Commission determined that it would not enforce the CFLA. The Attorney General then filed the instant action. The court had jurisdiction to decide the constitutionality of the CFLA because there was a present, substantial controversy between the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, and the Commission had stated that it would not enforce the CFLA unless its constitutionality was determined. Because public financing provisions of the CFLA substantially burdened the free speech rights of Nebraska citizens, pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. I and Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, the provisions were unconstitutional. Furthermore, the unconstitutional portions of the CFLA were not severable from the remaining portions and, therefore, the entire act was invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the District Court for Lancaster County, Nebraska, convicting him of a Class IV felony under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-4011(1) (Cum. Supp. 2010) based on his failure to comply with certain registration provisions of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-4004(9) (Cum.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-4004(9). The reviewing court found that the record showed that defendant received an eviction notice on April 1, 2010, and moved out of his residence on April 4. Defendant did not report the change until May 1, after being contacted by the sheriff's office. Defendant failed to comply with Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-4004(9) for several weeks. Therefore, whether or not the 3-day requirement of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-4004(9) might be too stringent as applied to another registrant who was unable to comply or whose compliance was interfered with, defendant did not report his change until nearly 30 days after required to do so, and he had not demonstrated facts that showed that the effect of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-4004(9) was punitive as applied to him.</SPAN></P>

He began registering as a sex offender upon his release from prison in 2003, and he was notified that he would have to register for 10 years thereafter.

Neither Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-4011 nor Neb. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An action was brought by plaintiff parents to recover medical expenses and loss of services based on their daughters' injuries. A second action was brought by plaintiff daughters for injuries incurred in the accident. The Douglas County District Court, Nebraska, found that the accident and resulting injuries were proximately caused by the negligence of defendant city, and awarded damages in both actions. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughters were injured in a city park when their saucer-type plastic sled collided with a crab apple tree. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in finding that the city should have expected that lawful visitors such as plaintiffs would fail to protect themselves against the danger posed by the crab apple trees. There was credible evidence to support the trial court's apportionment of fault, and the apportionment bore a reasonable relationship to the respective elements of negligence proved at trial. The city knew that the crab apple trees posed a risk to those who used the park for sledding, yet took no action to decrease or eliminate the risk. The claim of one of the daughters and her parents' claims were subject to separate damages caps. From the daughter's significant injuries, two separate causes of action arose - one in favor of the daughter and the other in favor of her parents for loss or damage sustained on account of her injury. Based upon its independent interpretation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-926(1) (Reissue 2007 &amp; Cum. Supp. 2010), the court concluded that the parents' claims were subject to a single damage cap of $1 million.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in the daughters' action. In the parents' action, the court modified the judgment in favor of the parents by combining the amounts and reducing the total to $1 million payable to them jointly, and it affirmed the judgment as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant restaurants filed an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against appellee city. They alleged that the restaurant ordinance was invalid as it imposed an unauthorized sales tax and violated the provisions of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 53-132(4) (Reissue 2010). The District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska) denied the restaurants' summary judgment motion and granted summary judgment in the city's favor. The restaurants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant tax did not have to be a sales tax simply because it was calculated upon gross receipts. Further, because the legal incidence of the tax fell on the business and not the customer, the restaurant tax was an occupation tax, not a sales tax. The restaurant tax was on the occupation of serving food and beverages - be they with or without alcohol. Reading Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 53-132(4) (Reissue 2010) as prohibiting any type of municipal occupation tax over $600 per year for any business that happened to hold a liquor license would have the absurd result that a liquor license would provide a special exemption from all occupation taxes otherwise applicable. Therefore, the restaurant tax in Omaha Mun. Code, ch. 19, art. XVI, &sect;&sect; 19-800 through 19-813 (2010), when applied to the restaurants, did not violate Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 53-132(4) (Reissue 2010). The restaurant ordinance's classification of restaurants and drinking places from other retail businesses in the city soundly rested on reasons of public policy, justice, and expediency. Thus, the classification bore a reasonable relation to the legitimate objective and purposes of the legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court proceeding arose from a March 6, 2012, objection filed by appellant with appellee Nebraska Secretary of State in which appellant challenged a candidate filing of a particular individual for the U.S. Senate. The Secretary of State had issued a determination opinion concluding that the candidate's name could appear on the May 15, 2012, primary election ballot. The petition filed in this case averred that pursuant to &sect; 32-624, the statutory deadline for reversing a finding by Secretary of State was 55 days prior to the primary election, or March 21, 2012. A judgment was filed by the district court at 7:18 p.m. on March 21, 2012, with the case being dismissed with prejudice. The Supreme Court assumed without deciding that subject matter jurisdiction existed. But the relief sought by appellant was not available under the election scheme as provided for by the legislature. A court order made after the 55th day preceding the election would violate the legislative mandate. The Supreme Court concluded that under the statutory procedure established by the legislature, it lacked authority to grant the relief sought by appellant.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-1735 (Reissue 2009) against appellee school districts challenging the constitutionality of tax levies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer paid two levies for the support of the school districts. He filed suit in the following tax year, contending that the statutes authorizing the levies were unconstitutional. The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The court held that suit could not be brought under &sect; 77-1735 to recover allegedly unconstitutional taxes, which did not meet the definition of &quot;illegal&quot; in &sect; 77-1735. Although &sect; 77-1735 allowed recovery for fraudulently levied taxes, the statute did not allow recovery for unconstitutional taxes and did not provide an adequate remedy for recovering an unconstitutional tax. A declaratory judgment was the proper method to challenge the constitutionality of a tax statute. Such an action would have to be brought within the time constraints of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-21,149 (Reissue 2008), which required that declaratory judgment actions challenging the constitutionality of tax statutes had to be brought in the same tax year in which the taxes were levied or assessed. Because the suit was not brought in the same tax year in which the taxes were levied or assessed, the district court did not have jurisdiction under &sect; 25-21,149.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that clear and convincing evidence supported the mental health board's finding that appellant was substantially unable to control his behavior.

Clear and convincing evidence also supported the board's finding that inpatient treatment was the least restrictive alternative. SOCA's provision regarding the composition of the board was consistent with due process requirements. The court found no reason that the board would be biased or prejudiced because of its statutory composition. The court rejected appellant's argument that the board could not properly make a commitment decision because a majority of its members were not trained in the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action, the Lancaster County District Court, Nebraska, determined that certain exemptions under the Nebraska Clean Indoor Air Act were unconstitutional.

Stat. &sect; 25-1315 (Reissue 2008). The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee business sought a declaration that the Act was special legislation, violated Nebraska's equal protection clause, and constituted a regulatory taking. The reviewing court did not reach the issue regarding whether the exemptions were unconstitutional because the State had not appealed from a final order. The district court specifically limited the hearing to the special legislation issue raised by appellee's motion for partial summary judgment. Nothing in the record indicated that the district court dismissed appellee's other constitutional claims that the Act constituted a regulatory taking and violated Nebraska's equal protection clause. Appellee's regulatory taking claim was not limited to the exemptions that the Act gave to other persons or entities. Appellee claimed that the smoking ban per se deprived it of a property interest by reducing its customer base and, thus, the revenues its business generated. The facts and legal arguments relevant to this claim had not been presented or addressed, and the claim was not moot because of the district court's special legislation ruling. Appellee's regulatory taking claim was alive and pending when the State's appeal was filed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-3442(2)(b) (Cum. Supp. 2010) was unconstitutional. The district court found that the tax was unconstitutional; the learning community and two school districts appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that the learning community's common levy was unconstitutional because it was a property tax for state purposes rather than local purposes in violation of Neb.

The court found, however, that much of the learning community legislation demonstrated a predominantly local purpose in that operational control remained local and a learning community provided a number of distinctly local services. Additionally, the legislative history made it clear that the legislation was enacted to resolve specific, local problems and that the predominant purpose of the legislation was not to benefit the state as a whole. Therefore, the trial court erred in finding Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-3442(2)(b)&nbsp;unconstitutional. Further, the tax did not violate constitutional prohibition against commutation of taxes, Neb.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence of defendant's prior crimes of kidnapping and robbery was admissible under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 27-404(2) (Reissue 2008) in his murder and robbery trial because evidence of defendant's prior crimes was independently relevant to show motive. The evidence surrounding the kidnapping and robbery was relevant because it proved defendant's rather desperate desire for money and transportation to Texas, and when the murder victims were killed, the perpetrator took their money and then drove their car to Texas. The logical relevance of the prior crimes did not depend upon an inference that defendant acted in conformity with a general propensity to commit crimes but depended upon the inference that the person who committed the murders wanted money and transportation to Texas, and the other crimes evidence proved defendant's pressing desire to obtain those specific things. Further, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress his statement to the police because defendant did not unequivocally assert his right to remain silent where he said, &quot;End of conversation; we're done,&quot; and then immediately picked up his conversation with the police where he had left off.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-4003(1)(b)(i)(B) (Cum. Supp. 2010), arguing that he was denied due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest to third-degree assault under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-310 (Reissue 2008) and was sentenced to probation for two years and jail for 30 days. After a hearing, the district court also ordered defendant to register under Nebraska's Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA). On review, the court held that defendant was entitled to procedural due process with regard to the trial court's finding under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-4003(1)(b)(i)(B). Before determining that a defendant convicted of a crime not sexual in nature was subject to SORA registration, the trial court had to provide notice and a hearing and must make the finding whether sexual penetration or sexual contact occurred in connection with the incident that gave rise to the conviction based on the record and the hearing. While defendant was given notice and a hearing, the trial court stated that it did not consider the evidence adduced at the hearing and instead found that defendant had committed an act of sexual contact subjecting him to SORA registration based solely on statements in the State's factual basis for the plea.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, kidnapping, sexual assault on a child, and use of a firearm to commit a felony in relation to the murder of a 15-year-old girl. After being found guilty, defendant elected to represent himself at the sentencing hearing, at which he requested the imposition of the death penalty. The sentencing panel obliged. Defendant moved for postconviction relief, arguing that his counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to challenge defendant's competency to stand trial. On review of the denial of postconviction relief, the court held that defendant failed to present any testimony or opinion to establish that he was incompetent at the time of the sentencing hearing, even failing to present the testimony of the prison psychiatrist who was treating him at the time of the sentencing hearing and who presumably would have some insight into his competency. Further, the desire for capital punishment did not create a reasonable probability of incompetency, and a rule requiring reversal when a capital defendant chose self-representation and insisted on the death penalty could easily be misused by a defendant who wished to embed his trial with reversible error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, the record owners of real property, filed an equitable action against appellant mineral rights owners under the dormant mineral statutes,&nbsp;Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 57-228 to -231 (Reissue 2010). The District Court for Scotts Bluff County (Nebraska) determined that the mineral interests had been abandoned pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 57-229, and vested title to the mineral interests in the surface owners. The mineral rights owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mineral interests at issue were created in 1953, when they were severed from the surface property. However, they were not transferred to the current mineral rights owners until 1985. The mineral rights owners argued that the district court erred in applying Nebraska's dormant mineral statutes to them because the statutes were not enacted until 1967 and, therefore, any application to them was retroactive and unconstitutional. However, the statutes were not applied retroactively to the mineral rights owners. The critical date was not 1953, but, rather, 1985. Prior to 1985, the mineral rights owners had no right of ownership in the severed mineral interests that could have been affected by the dormant mineral statutes. At the time of the transfer, the mineral rights owners were presumed to have knowledge of the law then in effect which affected their prospective enjoyment and retention of the mineral interests. They had the full 23-year period specified in &sect; 57-229 to publicly exercise their right of ownership so as to prevent abandonment of the mineral interests, and they failed to do so. Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding that those interests were abandoned.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-306 (Reissue 2008). Defendant challenged the statute's constitutionality on the ground that it criminalizes negligent acts. The reviewing court held that misdemeanor motor vehicle homicide is a public welfare offense which does not require proof of mens rea. While motor vehicle homicide bears some relationship to manslaughter, it is more directly related to the predicate traffic offenses upon which it is based, which are not taken from the common law. A motor vehicle homicide conviction does not gravely besmirch the character of the defendant, and the penalty, while it can potentially include a term of imprisonment, is relatively small for an offense which causes a person's death. The district court did not err in rejecting defendant's constitutional arguments or affirming the county court's decision to convict him of motor vehicle homicide without proof of mens rea.</SPAN></P>

The city filed a declaratory judgment action to have the proposed measure declared invalid. The Lincoln County District Court, Nebraska, concluded that the petition violated Neb. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ballot measure would have amended a city ordinance that imposed an occupation tax. The court concluded that although the district court had authority to decide the city's challenges to the measure, it erred in blocking a count of the vote on the measure, and the court vacated that portion of the district court's order. Although the district court correctly ruled that the proposed ordinance was a referendum measure, instead of a combined initiative and referendum, it erred in ruling that &sect; 18-2528(1)(a) barred the referendum. Section 18-2528(1)(a) does not shield from the referendum process general taxation measures that become necessary to meeting a city's subsequent contractual obligations for municipal projects that the city had not previously approved in a measure subject to referendum. Appellants' petition did not interfere with a contractual obligation, and the district court's ruling that the measure violated &sect; 18-2528(1)(a) was subject to reversal. The court found merit to the city's cross-appeal claim that the proposed referendum violated the common-law single subject rule because voters were asked to approve of independent and distinct propositions in a single vote.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, plaintiff landowners appealed a judgment of the Lancaster County District Court, Nebraska, upholding the constitutionality of the occupation tax, authorized by L.B. 701 (Neb. 2007), codified at Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2-3226.05 (Cum. Supp. 2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the occupation tax was not a property tax for state purposes prohibited by Neb. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1A. The occupation tax was not dependent upon the value of the land being taxed. Although two tracts, both classified as irrigated, might have vastly different value based upon various other factors, the levy of the occupation tax did not take the differing values into account. A landowner could avoid the occupation tax by certifying to the natural resources district the nonirrigation status of the land on a year-by-year basis. The statutory authority conferred by L.B. 701 to issue riverflow enhancement bonds and levy an occupation tax to provide revenue for their payment could not be fairly seen as a special favor bestowed upon an a natural resources district. Rather, it was an instrument to be utilized in maintaining compliance with an interstate compact. For these reasons, the statute authorizing the occupation tax did not constitute special legislation prohibited by Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 18. The landowners did not meet their burden of establishing that the occupation tax violated Neb. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4, which prohibited the commutation of taxes.</SPAN></P>

Appellant petitioned for judicial review, but the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska) agreed that appellant was required to register as a sex offender. Appellant timely appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A sex offender registrant's actual registration under another jurisdiction's law was conclusive evidence that the registrant was required to register within the meaning of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-4003(1)(a)(iv) (Cum. Supp. 2010). Thus, the evidence established beyond reasonable dispute that appellant was required to register as a sex offender in Florida and entered Nebraska after January 1, 1997. Therefore, although the supreme court's reasoning differed somewhat from that of the hearing officer and the district court, it agreed with their conclusion that SORA applied to appellant. Also, a party to an administrative appeal who wished to raise an issue in district court, whether or not that issue was presented to the agency, had to still present that issue to the court in its petition for judicial review. Appellant did not. The district court thus did not err when it refused to address the issue of constitutionality, and because the issue was not properly preserved for judicial review, the supreme court too did not address the issue of whether SORA, as applied to appellant, was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile argued that because there was no explicit standard of proof in &sect; 43-247(3)(c), the State should be required to prove that the juvenile was mentally ill and dangerous beyond a reasonable doubt rather than by clear and convincing evidence. The juvenile court noted that &sect; 43-247(3)(c) did not explicitly give a standard of proof, but the trial court determined to apply a clear and convincing evidence standard. The juvenile asserted that the lack of a standard of proof under &sect; 43-247(3)(c) meant that the standard would default to the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. However, the court upheld the decision because the juvenile offered no support for that assertion. The court held that commitments under the MHCA and the Sex Offender Commitment Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71-1201 et seq. (Reissue 2009), were made under the clear and convincing evidence standard and that mental health commitment acts were not unconstitutional for failing to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court for Douglas County, Nebraska, that convicted him of first-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder, first-degree assault, and two counts of use of a weapon to commit a felony, arguing that the district court erred by not granting his motion for a directed verdict and erred in allowing the jury to separate without his consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict on the ground that the State failed to present any direct evidence that he intended to kill or rob the victims because, when the sufficiency of the evidence as to criminal intent was questioned, independent evidence of specific intent was not required. Rather, the intent with which an act was committed was a mental process and could be inferred from the words and acts of defendant and from the circumstances surrounding the incident. Thus, the State was not required to present any such direct evidence. Defendant's motion was properly denied because, viewed in a light most favorable to the State, the evidence showed that defendant was aware of cocaine secreted in the victims' vehicle and knew the amount of money sale of the cocaine would bring and how much money he would have to pay the victims' to buy the drugs from them. The evidence showed that defendant told a third party that he wanted to &quot;get&quot; the victims, that he obtained two weapons from acquaintances, and that he lured the victims into a closed garage with just one exit, and that he shot the victims, killing one.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the district court failed to obtain defendant's express consent for the jury's separation under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2022 (Reissue 2008), defendant was entitled to a presumption that he was prejudiced by that separation. The case was remanded to the district court for a hearing at which the State had the burden of showing that no injury resulted from the jury's separation.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The record showed that defendant was informed of the decoy's supposed age well before he said anything that even approached the speech covered by the statute. When the decoy told defendant her age, defendant asked if he was too old, which indicated that he read and understood the decoy's message. Other statements made by defendant showed that defendant knew he was talking to a minor. At that point, defendant could have left the conversation without violating any law. The decoy did not encourage him to stay, nor did the decoy urge him to discuss anything sexual. In fact, the chat logs indicated that the decoy protested when defendant's questions and comments turned sexual. Even over those protests, defendant continued to push the conversation toward the topic of sex. The only times the decoy mentioned sex were in response to defendant's questions. The record failed to show that the state induced defendant to act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence during the guilt phase of the trial of his prior assaults on his stepdaughters. The court agreed that the trial court erred, but determined that the error was harmless. The admission of other acts evidence by its nature was usually prejudicial, but in the case at issue it was not because defendant admitted molesting young girls and impregnating his stepdaughter. Additionally, defendant was inescapably tied to the killing of the victim through DNA evidence that was admissible and persuasive. Defendant was further connected to the murder by physical evidence that proved to be consistent with defendant's careless statements that had already been reported to investigators. There was no innocent explanation for how defendant's DNA came to be on the victim's bloody clothing. Nor was there any innocent explanation for how several witnesses came forward with information before the victim's body or defendant's DNA on her clothing had been discovered linking him to the killing. Thus, the court found that no reasonable trier of fact could have overlooked the proper evidence and made a different decision.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 71-1201 to 71-1226 (Reissue 2009) and should be committed for inpatient treatment. Appellee, the Lancaster County Mental Health Board, opposed the inmate's action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that the district court erred in affirming the Board's decision to overrule his motion to dismiss based on the failure of Nebraska Department of Correctional Services (DCS) to comply with Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 83-174.02. That statute directed DCS to order a mental health evaluation of certain sex offenders including those convicted of sexual assault in the first degree. The court held that the district court did not err in affirming the Board's overruling of the motion to dismiss based upon an alleged failure to comply with &sect; 83-174.02(2) because the statute did not create any substantive or procedural rights in the offender who was the subject of the mental health evaluation. The inmate further asserted that when he was sentenced in 1991 he was found not to be a mentally disordered sexual offender. He argued that the 1991 determination was a bar to the 2010 proceedings in which he was found to be a dangerous sex offender based upon res judicata. The court disagreed because the purpose of the SOCA was to provide for the court-ordered treatment of sex offenders who had completed their sentences but continue to pose a threat of harm.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 71-1201 (Reissue 2009). The inmate had been convicted and imprisoned for first degree sexual assault several years earlier.</SPAN></P>

The Board found that inpatient treatment was necessary. The district court upheld the Board's decision. On appeal, the inmate argued that the Board's admission of these experts' opinions violated his right to confront witnesses because Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71-954 gave defendants under the Sex Offender Commitment Act the same right to confront and cross-examine witnesses as the Nebraska and Federal Constitutions. The court determined that because the expert was the only witness testifying against a defendant under the Act that the defendant's ability to cross-examine the expert satisfied the requirement of the Confrontation Clause so long as the underlying statements were not relayed to the jury. However, in the case at issue the experts testified to out-of-court accusations or other testimonial statements. Thus, both hearsay and Confrontation Clause issues were presented.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their motion for change of placement, the adoptive parents of the child's siblings alleged that their adoptive children had a fundamental liberty interest in the integrity of the family unit including a relationship with the child, their biological sibling, that was protected by the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend.

Although the juvenile court did not specifically address this issue, the adoptive parents urged the court to recognize the existence of the claimed constitutional right as a matter of first impression. The court disagreed and determined that the adoptive parents lacked standing because the parent-child relationship between the siblings and their biological parents was extinguished by relinquishment in the case by the adopted siblings biological parents and by termination of the mother's parental rights of the child. The maternal grandparents also lacked standing because any interest or right which they may have had by virtue of their biological relationship to the child ceased to exist when the parental rights of their daughter were terminated.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the sentences and, on direct appeal, claimed that the provision that his sentences be without parole should be vacated. The court affirmed defendant's convictions on both counts of first degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Lancaster County District Court, Nebraska, determined that appellant was a person in need of court-ordered custody and treatment under the Developmental Disabilities Court-Ordered Custody Act (DDCCA), Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71-1101 et seq. (Reissue 2009). The district court found the DDCCA to be constitutional. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who had a developmental disability consistent with a diagnosis of mild mental retardation, sexually assaulted another person. The court upheld the constitutionality of the DDCCA. The DDCCA requires that the State prove by clear and convincing evidence that the subject is a person with a developmental disability, is in need of court-ordered custody and treatment, and poses a threat of harm to others. It does not require a finding of future harm prior to the entry of a court order for custody and treatment. Under the DDCCA, sexual assault is one of the manners in which a threat of harm to others can be shown. The DDCCA provides procedures and evidentiary standards which protect an individual's constitutionally protected liberty interest and does not violate the subject's due process rights. Appellant committed the sexual assault in 2007. This act fit within the statutory definition of a threat of harm to others.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-6,197.03(6) (Supp. 2007). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the stop which eventually led to his arrest for DUI violated his Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, rights and that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress all evidence obtained from the stop. The supreme court found that defendant's odd and reckless driving behavior created a reasonable suspicion, if not probable cause, that defendant was driving while impaired by drugs or alcohol. The evidence of defendant's impairment derived from the stop was admissible. The trial court did not err in considering defendant's prior California DUI convictions in sentencing him under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-6,197.02. The prosecution presented prima facie evidence of defendant's prior convictions by presenting a certified copy of his California DUI convictions which the State demonstrated were counseled. The certified copies of documents relating to the 2004 conviction showed that defendant entered his plea and was sentenced during a hearing on September 17, 2004. There was no error in defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician filed a complaint against appellees, the Division of Public Health of the Department of Health and Human Services (Department) and the Attorney General (AG), to rescind an assurance of compliance entered into under Nebraska's Uniform Credentialing Act (UCA), Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 38-101 to 38-1,140 (Reissue 2008 &amp; Cum. Supp. 2010). The physician appealed the rulings of the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska) against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The UCA permitted complaints against a credential holder to be resolved by entry of a voluntary &quot;assurance of compliance.&quot; The physician entered into such an assurance with an assistant AG. The physician alleged that although the assistant AG told him that he would not be subject to disciplinary proceedings, the assurance of compliance had the effect of a disciplinary sanction because of the collateral consequences on his career. On appeal, the court disagreed with the physician that he was deprived of the due process of law. Had he refused the assurance of compliance, any discipline imposed upon him would have required a hearing and permitted a judicial review that would have satisfied the requirements of due process. The physician voluntarily entered into the assurance of compliance, and notions of &quot;fundamental fairness&quot; were not violated by the State's refusal to permit the physician to withdraw it. As to the physician's fraudulent concealment claim, the court found that the physician did allege facts that, if substantiated, supported the existence of a duty on the part of the assistant AG to disclose the possible collateral consequences of the assurance of compliance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's order of dismissal with respect to the physician's due process claims. The court reversed the district court's order with respect to the physician's fraudulent concealment claim and remanded the cause for further proceedings on that claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the district court erred when it affirmed the sentence imposed by the county court because given their understanding of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-6,197.09 (Cum. Supp. 2008), the lower courts did not consider probation a sentencing option and, as a result, erred in imposing and affirming his sentence. The supreme court agreed. The record indicated that the lower courts erroneously determined probation was not a sentencing option in this case and that the district court did not consider the imposition of probation in evaluating the propriety of the sentence actually imposed. By its terms, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-6,197.03(5) provided for the possibility of a sentence of probation in a case such as the present one, and &sect; 60-6,197.09 did not preclude the imposition of probation in the present case. The county court erred as a matter of law when it did not consider probation at sentencing, and the district court erred when it affirmed the sentence based on the same misperception of the applicable law.</SPAN></P>

The student had filed under title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (title II), 42 U.S.C.S &sect; 12133, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student sued the Board, the UNMC, and faculty members in each individual's official and individual capacities. He sought damages for fraudulent concealment, alleged violations of his constitutional rights, and breach of contract stemming from his dismissal. The district court dismissed with prejudice the student's complaint against the UNMC faculty members in their individual capacities because he did not perfect service and his complaint against the Board, UNMC, and the UNMC faculty members in their official capacities on the basis that he failed to state a claim or that his claims were barred by sovereign immunity. The district court erred in dismissing the claims under title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and &sect; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 against the Board, UNMC, and the faculty members in their official capacities because Congress had validly abrogated U.S. Const. amend XI immunity for title II claims of discrimination in public education. Additionally, the State conceded that it waived immunity for claims under the Rehabilitation Act. The court also reversed the district court's dismissal of the faculty members, in their individual capacities.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that, while an aider and abettor could not be sentenced to death if he did not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place, the jury was not required to consider whether defendant was a principal or aider and abettor because the evidence clearly established that defendant was a major participant, not an aider and abettor. Specifically, the evidence established that defendant planned the bank robbery, recruited participants, obtained weapons, and carried out the plan. Further, within a minute of entering the bank, defendant fatally shot three of the five victims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) challenged an order of the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska), declaring that Regulation 2-020.09B2f was invalid insofar as it removed Medicaid benefits for appellee participant and others who failed to comply with their Employment First self-sufficiency contracts. Participant cross-appealed the court's failure to permit the class members from seeking all the remedies available.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the action. The district court did not err in refusing to certify the class for any claims for monetary relief. The district court was correct in declaring 468 Neb. Admin. Code &sect; 2-020.09B2f invalid. Section 68-1723 of the Welfare Reform Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 68-1723, set forth specific provisions concerning the prescribed sanction for noncompliance with Employment First self-sufficiency contracts. That provision specified only that the family's &quot;cash assistance&quot; shall be removed as a consequence of noncompliance. In enacting 468 Neb. Admin. Code &sect; 2-020.09B2f, which removed Medicaid benefits for participants who failed to comply with the Employment First self-sufficiency contracts, DHHS unlawfully enlarged upon the authorizing statutes and violated the principles of separation of powers. If the Legislature had intended to remove Medicaid as a sanction for noncompliance, there was no reason not to have stated so in &sect; 68-1723.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating a city ordinance prohibiting telephone harassment. Defendant filed two motions to discharge on statutory speedy trial grounds. The county court denied both motions to discharge, and the Douglas County District Court, Nebraska, affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly left harassing messages on her ex-husband's answering machine. The primary issue in this case was whether the &quot;intimate partner&quot; exception of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-1207(2) (Reissue 2008) applied to toll the six-month speedy trial clock. The reviewing court concluded that the exception did not apply. Telephone harassment neither involved nor included &quot;intimate partner&quot; as an element. Defendant was charged by complaint on September 17, 2008, and was arraigned on March 3, 2009. She filed her motions for discharge on March 20 and 23, 2009. Because the intimate partner exception of &sect; 29-1207(2) did not apply and there were no excludable periods under &sect; 29-1207(4), the speedy trial clock expired on March 17, 2009. Because the State did not bring defendant to trial within the required time, she was entitled to absolute discharge of her case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court reversed the lower courts' orders denying defendant's motion for absolute discharge and remanded the matter to the district court with directions to reverse the judgment of the county court and remand the cause with directions to dismiss the complaint against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The payments pursuant to the severance agreements were not earned and did not accrue through the employees' continued labor. The employees were not entitled to compensation if they resigned, if they were terminated for just cause, or if the annexation did not occur. Therefore, the payments were not compensation for labor or services rendered. The supreme court interpreted Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45-103.04(2) (Reissue 2004) to prohibit prejudgment interest for any action involving the state, any action involving a political subdivision of the state, or any action involving an employee of the state or political subdivision for any negligent or wrongful act or omission accruing within the scope of such employee's office or employment. The statute precluded the employees' claims against the city for prejudgment interest on their severance agreement payments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the officer testified that he conducted field sobriety tests after noting a moderate odor of alcohol coming first from defendant's vehicle and later from defendant himself. This was sufficient to provide the officer with reasonable suspicion to conduct field sobriety tests on defendant. There was nothing in the record, in particular in the manual, suggesting that the HGN indicators were not valid if the test did not take 80 seconds to perform. The officer testified that he followed 177 Neb. Admin. Code ch. 1 (2004) in administering the preliminary breath test (PBT). At least 15 minutes elapsed between the initial contact between the officer and defendant and the administration of the PBT. The county court properly admitted the results of the blood test finding defendant's blood alcohol content to be.093, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-6,201(3) (Cum. Supp. 2008). Defendant's argument that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-6,197.04 (Reissue 2004) was unconstitutional was without merit as an officer was reasonable in administering a PBT if he could point to specific, articulable facts indicating that an individual had been driving under the influence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the DMV received the arresting officer's sworn report that was required to revoke the driver's license under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-498.01(3) (Reissue 2004), a member of the DMV's legal division sent a copy of the report back to the officer along with an addendum form. The form advised the officer that the reasons for arrest on the sworn report might not have conferred jurisdiction to revoke the license because it did not explain how the officer determined that the driver was intoxicated. The officer then completed the addendum and returned it to the DMV. On appeal, the driver argued that the DMV could not use an addendum to the sworn report to obtain jurisdiction. It was determined that the DMV had the power, in an administrative license revocation (ALR) proceeding to evaluate the jurisdictional averments in a sworn report and, if necessary, solicit a sworn addendum to that report if necessary to establish jurisdiction to proceed. The procedure followed by the DMV was proper and necessary to accomplish the plain purpose of the ALR statute under the Administrative Procedure Act, Neb. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The location of the state fair had been set by statute since 1901. At its annual meeting, the state fair board admitted the state fair and its campus were in financial crisis. The legislature held public hearings on the matter and investigated new models for the state fair. It eventually passed Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2-101 (Supp. 2009), to relocate the fair from Lincoln, Nebraska to Grand Island, Nebraska. The protesters sought a declaratory judgment finding that &sect; 2-101 was unconstitutional and void in its entirety. The district court dismissed the action and found &sect; 2-101 was constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment because &sect; 2-101 did not violate the closed class prohibition of Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 18, and was intended to designate a permanent location for the state fair. The court ruled the protesters did not overcome the presumption of constitutionality nor meet their burden of showing that &sect; 2-101 was an unconstitutional grant of special privileges or benefits. The court held there was no evidence the legislature's decision was arbitrary or capricious and concluded that the state fair was for a public purpose.</SPAN></P>

The mother was accorded a full evidentiary hearing, at which hearing she was represented by counsel and had the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine the witnesses, and the State was required to present clear and convincing evidence of neglect of prior siblings and current best interests. The State established by clear and convincing evidence that it was in the best interests of the four children that the mother's parental rights be terminated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the district court erred in finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and in failing to find that the Measure contained multiple subjects, in violation of the single subject rule. The supreme court noted that actions for declaratory judgment pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-2538 (Reissue 2007) were subject to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-21,149 (Reissue 2008). An action for declaratory judgment could not be used to decide the legal effect of a state of facts which were future, contingent, or uncertain. If the residents of the city had not yet voted on the Measure, it may not be adopted. thus, the city presented the supreme court with a state of facts that were contingent and uncertain. The city's request for declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of the Measure before the citizens had adopted the Measure was a request for an advisory opinion. The district court properly found that since the issues raised in the Measure had a natural and necessary connection with each other and were part of the general subject of regulating illegal aliens in the city, the single subject rule, Neb.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that as a probationary certificated employee, the teacher was entitled by statute to an employment contract, certain benefits under the collective bargaining agreement, and notice and hearing before termination. The employee did not have an actionable 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. There was no evidence that it was the official policy of the school district to create &quot;long-term substitutes&quot; in an attempt to circumvent the Nebraska tenure statutes. The student services director, the assistant superintendent, and the principal did not have the authority to establish final policy for the school district. It was not custom of the school district to hire as &quot;long-term substitutes&quot; employees who really were &quot;probationary certified employees,&quot; and then discharge them without notice or hearing. 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 would not have been an appropriate basis for relief, and attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 were not recoverable. Although state remedies may not provide all the relief which may have been available under &sect; 1983, such as recovery of attorney fees, that did not mean that the state remedies were not adequate to satisfy due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed awarding the teacher reinstatement, backpay, and benefits; the award of attorney fees and costs was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to grant a change of venue from Richardson County. The supreme court agreed with the trial court that the evidence provided by defendant did not demonstrate the type of invidious or inflammatory coverage that could create a presumption of prejudice, much less the pervasiveness. There was no evidence that the court refused to individually examine any specified juror over whom defense counsel had special concerns. Evidence of the forgery would have been admissible for a proper purpose in a felony murder trial, regardless of joinder. The forgery illustrated defendant's motive to commit felony murder. While defendant may have been deprived of lesser-included offense instructions, he was granted the possibility of acquittal if the proof of the robbery was found inadequate, regardless of whether the jury believed that he had killed the victim. Defendant failed to show how the evidence would support an acquittal of felony murder while supporting a conviction of unlawful-act manslaughter. The continuing questioning of defendant during and after his polygraph examinations was not in violation of his right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. There was evidence that defendant had demonstrated normal adaptive behavior in several areas. Defendant was never placed in an academic program designed for students with mental retardation. There was evidence that defendant had been employed by a trucker to assist in finding addresses for pickups and deliveries, and that while so employed, he was well-liked, responsive, hard-working, friendly, and talkative. While so employed, defendant was responsible in part for planning the routes and the order of deliveries or pickups, and when problems occurred, he would communicate with the trucking company's dispatcher to get an address correction or additional instructions. Correctional employees testified that defendant selected books from the book cart and subscribed to other publications.

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 43-104 to 43-104.25 (Reissue 2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's biological mother instituted paternity proceedings, and although a temporary order of support and visitation was entered, the suit was ultimately dismissed for lack of prosecution. When the child's mother and stepfather instituted proceedings for the stepfather to adopt the child, the biological father filed an untimely objection; all parties moved for summary judgment. On review, the court held that the county court properly concluded that the biological father was not the child's adjudicated father because the temporary order of support was not a final order determining paternity. However, because the biological father had established a familial relationship with the child, the application of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 43-104(3), 43-104.04, and 43-104.22(7) (Reissue 2008) infringed upon his constitutionally protected parental rights. The father, mother, and child lived together for three years, the father established familial ties with the child, and it was undisputed that the father was the child's biological father. The biological father was owed substantial constitutional protection, and the county court erred in ruling that his consent to the adoption was not required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment in favor of the child's mother and stepfather was reversed, and the decree of adoption was vacated. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court for Lancaster County, Nebraska, that convicted him of use of a computer to entire a child or peace officer believed to be a child for sexual purposes in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-320.02 (2008), arguing that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-320.02 is unconstitutional and that his sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court rejected defendant's argument Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-320.02 criminalized enticement of a child to engage in any sort of sexual conduct, whether or not it would be illegal to actually engage in such conduct with the child because defendant misread the statute. By its terms, &sect; 28-320.02 specifically referred to enticing a child to engage in an act that would violate Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 28-319, 28-319.01, 28-320.01, or 28-320(1) or (2). Therefore, one could violate &sect; 28-320.02 only if the contemplated sexual conduct would violate one of the specified statutes. If one used a computer to entice a child to engage in an act that would not be in violation of any of the specified statutes, then that person would not violate &sect; 28-320.02. Further, the statute did not implicate speech regarding otherwise legal activity but targeted only speech used for the purpose of enticing a child to engage in illegal sexual conduct, and such speech was not protected by the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I. Lastly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sentence because the one- to two-year sentence imposed was well within the five-year statutory maximum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two other men shot and killed four bank employees and one customer during an attempted bank robbery in a small town. Defendant shot one woman himself. The District Court for Madison County (Nebraska) convicted him after a jury trial of five counts of first degree murder, six counts of use of a deadly weapon to commit a felony, robbery, and burglary. Defendant was sentenced to death. He appealed, attacking the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The crimes were committed after the U.S. Supreme Court's Ring decision, which held that a jury had to decide those facts which a state legislature had already determined to be essential to a sentence of death, but before L.B. 1 (Neb. 2002), which reassigned from judges to juries the responsibility for determining the existence of any aggravating circumstances. The court upheld the death sentence. Despite the fact that there was no constitutional procedure to determine death eligibility in a trial for first degree murder during the months between Ring and L.B. 1, Nebraska's death penalty remained valid. Further, L.B. 1 was not a bill of attainder. In addition, defendant was not entitled to a step instruction to determine whether a verdict of first degree murder was based on a theory of premeditation or felony murder. Enmund/Tison &quot;findings&quot; pertaining to his level of culpability were not elements of the offense of felony murder, even when the death penalty was imposed. Finally, despite the personal connections of the community and extensive pretrial publicity, the record did not indicate that the jurors who ultimately sat on defendant's trial were anything but fair and impartial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found merit to defendant's challenge to the electric chair as a method of implementing the death penalty, but it nevertheless affirmed the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the recently discovered recantation by the witness was in no way probative of whether the State knew or should have known the witness's testimony was perjured at the time of defendant's trial or whether it failed to disclose exculpatory evidence with regard to the witness's testimony. None of the facts alleged in the current motion could prove the State knowingly used perjured testimony against defendant. On its face, defendant's motion for post-conviction relief failed to affirmatively show that he could not have raised these issues either on direct appeal or during prior motions for new trial and postconviction relief. The supreme court would not set aside the decision more than a decade after it was made based only on the recent recantation of some portion of a key witness' testimony against defendant. The presence of perjury by a key witness did not, in and of itself, present a constitutional violation. The recantation did not refute the evidence that defendant committed the crimes. There was no merit to defendant's argument that the witness's testimony was unconstitutionally coerced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court for Adams County, Nebraska, denied appellant building owner's motion for summary judgment on appellee patron's negligence action and granted appellee bank's motion, and dismissed the bank as a party. The district court dismissed the remaining claims. The Nebraska Court of Appeals dismissed the owner's appeal as moot. The owner petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that the court of appeals erred in dismissing its appeal as moot. The supreme court noted that in the court of appeals, no order to show cause was entered that directed either party to adduce evidence relating to mootness. Without a motion or order requiring the owner to present evidence of damages, there was no basis for the court of appeals to infer mootness from the absence of such evidence. The order of dismissal did not mean that the owner could not prove liability arising from other source. The bank was required to indemnify the owner for any claim or damage arising out of any injury occurring in the building to a bank customer, except for claims arising from the owner's gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The lease connoted the unmistakable intent of the parties to indemnify, excepting only claims arising from the bank's ordinary negligence, the owner's gross negligence, or the willful misconduct of either. &quot;Maintenance of a building,&quot; within the meaning of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-21,187(1) (Reissue 2008), did not encompass the ordinary activities associated with management of commercial property. Indemnity could also be based on an express contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that U.S. Const. amend. VI precluded a sentencing judge sitting without a jury from finding an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty. The supreme court found that defendant's conviction was final before the Supreme Court's decision in Ring, and the Ring decision did not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct appeal. Defendant was no longer subject to electrocution. Most of defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims were procedurally barred where the allegations that were not raised on direct appeal were known to defendant at trial, because they formed the basis of many of his disagreements with the public defender's office. Defendant could not use a motion for postconviction relief to collaterally attack issues that were decided against him on direct appeal. The record from defendant's direct appeal contradicted his argument that the Nebraska Commission on Public Advocacy should have investigated the public defender's performance or that defendant was prejudiced by any failure to do so. Direct appeal counsel did not act deficiently in raising the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the denial of his motion for postconviction relief by the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska). Defendant had been convicted of murder in the second degree, first degree assault, and two counts of use of a firearm to commit a felony. In the present motion, defendant alleged ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court affirmed the denial of relief. The court found that four of the allegations of ineffective assistance of trial counsel were procedurally barred because the issues could have been litigated on direct appeal. As to counsel's failure to call a police officer as a witness, defendant gave no reason to believe that his counsel's performance was deficient or that defendant was prejudiced. His claim at trial was that he had acted in self-defense. Even if the officer's testimony had impeached testimony from other witnesses as to who was present at the scene, defendant could not maintain a claim of prejudice because he never denied that he and the victims were present. Defendant also failed to show prejudice from appellate counsel's conduct. Finally, the issue that removing the malice requirement from the second degree murder statute rendered Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-304&nbsp;unconstitutional was procedurally barred. Even if the issue were properly raised, the court had previously addressed the issue and found that the differences between manslaughter and second degree murder were apparent from the plain language of the statutes of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 28-304 and 28-305.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a retired State employee, brought an action against defendant, the director of the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services, in the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska), arguing that by failing to pay him for an accumulation of sick leave at his retirement, the State deprived him of a property right and impaired his right to contract. The district court granted summary judgment to the State, and the employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked full time as a revenue audit manager for the State from December 9, 1974, through December 29, 2006, when he retired at the age of 62. He claimed that his sick leave balance was reduced by a total of 2,786 hours from December 31, 1988, through December 31, 2005. At the time of his retirement, Sack's sick leave balance was 1,566.50 hours, and he was paid for 25 percent of those hours pursuant to Neb. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 81-1324 and 81-1325 (Reissue 2008). The statutes governing the accumulation and use of sick leave were in place when the employee was hired and throughout his employment with the State. The employee contended that he had a vested right to all earned sick leave under the Nebraska Wage Payment and Collection Act and that Neb. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 81-1320 to 81-1326 constituted special legislation in violation of the Nebraska Constitution. The court held that &sect;&sect; 81-1320 through 81-1326 were more specific than the Act because they applied particularly to State employees; therefore, they governed the employee's situation. The classification of &quot;state employees&quot; was not arbitrary, and therefore the legislation was not special legislation.</SPAN></P>

In other words, regardless of whether the tape was exculpatory, requiring the prosecution to disclose the tape, the district court concluded that it actually had been disclosed. The district court did not clearly err in making that finding. The prosecutor testified on at least two separate occasions that defendant's counsel was aware of the tape and that the prosecutor had even played it for them. The county attorney generally denied hiding any evidence from defense counsel. Defendant never questioned his lead counsel on the subject, despite his having made a reference to a &quot;Voicegram&quot; at trial, and cocounsel's testimony seemed not entirely certain. While the co-defendant's counsel stated emphatically that he was unaware of a 911 tape, his testimony was not directly probative of what defendant's counsel knew.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court for Lancaster County, Nebraska, affirmed appellee Nebraska Department of Revenue's (Department) finding that appellant manufacturer's purchases were not exempt from the Nebraska Revenue Act (Act), Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 77-2701 to 77-27,135.01 and 77-27,228 to 77-27,236 (Reissue 2003 &amp; Cum. Supp. 2006). The manufacturer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer argued that machinery and equipment purchased as component parts and used to construct another piece of manufacturing machinery and equipment were not exempt from taxation pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 77-2701.47(1) and 77-2704.22(1). The supreme court agreed with the manufacturer that &sect; 77-2701.47(1)(h) supported its construction of the Act. It would make very little sense to exempt assembled machinery from sales and use taxes, and to exempt each and every part of that machinery from sales and use taxes if it was purchased to replace an original part, but to impose a tax on the purchase of the same parts when they were purchased to assemble the machinery in the first place. The duty of determining whether a manufacturer's purchase of a common part was tax exempt would fall more on the manufacturer than on the Department. There was no relevant distinction between purchasing preassembled machinery or equipment, purchasing kits for assembling machinery or equipment, paying a vendor to purchase and assemble the parts, and purchasing one's own list of components to assemble into machinery and equipment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court for Lancaster County, Nebraska, denied appellant foster care providers' action for declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that warrantless home visits pursuant to the Foster Care Review Act (Act), Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 43-1301 to 43-1318 (Reissue 2008), would violate their constitutional rights, because appellee State Foster Care Review Board (State Board) had not promulgated rules. The providers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the providers and appellant corporation had standing to assert their claim only with respect to the premises upon which they provided foster care and that the director had no legal interest in the case separate from that of the corporation. The State had an obligation to see that foster children were receiving proper care, and foster care providers had an obligation to the children and the State to provide such care. To the extent constitutional rights may be implicated by home visits, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1303(3) (Reissue 2008), the visits had to be judged under a general standard of reasonableness which have been applied when special governmental needs justified a departure from the requirements of individualized suspicion, warrants, and probable cause under traditional U.S. Const. amend. IV, analysis. The absence of specific regulations governing home visits was one factor that a court could consider in determining whether a specific visit was constitutionally unreasonable, but was not the exclusive or the dispositive factor. The district court properly dismissed the providers' claim against the State Board director in her individual capacity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed the board erred in concluding that he was a dangerous sex offender because there was insufficient evidence to conclude that he suffered from a mental illness which made him likely to violently reoffend or to be unable to control his criminal behavior. The court concluded there was clear and convincing evidence to support the board's finding that appellant was a dangerous sex offender, as defined in Neb. Rev. Stat. 83-174.01 (Reissue 2008). Although appellant argued that there was no evidence other than his conviction and his admissions to show he was unable to control his impulses and that he fell within the low-moderate range on the Static-99 test, which measured the probability of reoffending, a psychologist testified that appellant was in the high risk range on another instrument that measured risk factors. Clear and convincing evidence also supported the board's finding that the least restrictive alternative for appellant was inpatient treatment. Appellant did not take part in any mental health treatment while incarcerated, nor did he agree to be screened for an inpatient sex offender program available through the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestee, who claimed to have been assaulted during an incident involving the officer, alleged four causes of action: (1) false arrest; (2) unconstitutional seizure; (3) excessive use of force; and (4) oppression under color of office. The arrestee did not allege that the officer acted outside the scope of his employment at the time of the alleged false arrest. The arrestee's causes of action fell under the Nebraska Political Subdivisions Tort Claims Act (PSTCA). The instant court concluded that the trial court was correct in concluding that the arrestee failed to state a relief for which relief could be granted. The claims for which the arrestee sought relief were encompassed by the protections of the PSTCA. The arrestee's cause of action for excessive force arose out of the alleged false arrest by the officer, acting within the scope of his employment. The arrestee did not plead any facts that would explain how the officer or the city would be liable without the connection of the employment relationship between the parties. Therefore, the city was protected by sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 71-1201 to 71-1226 (Cum. Supp. 2008). Appellant filed an appeal, challenging the constitutionality of SOCA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree sexual assault on a child for sexually assaulting his girlfriend's daughter over a five-year period. He was incarcerated for six years. Upon his scheduled release, the Board found him to be a dangerous sex offender under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 83-174.01(1)(a) and committed him to secure inpatient treatment. The Supreme Court of Nebraska found that the Board's decision was supported by clear and convincing evidence. A clinical psychologist testified that appellant was a pedophile, suffered from cannabis dependence and depression, and had a personality disorder. Appellant was still a danger to society, as he did not complete sex offender treatment while in prison. The Supreme Court of Nebraska held that SOCA was civil in nature; therefore, it could be applied retroactively without violating principles of double jeopardy or ex post facto. SOCA did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses, as dangerous sex offenders were not similarly situated to other non-sex-related offenders; furthermore, the legislature had a rational and legitimate basis for treating sex offenders differently than the mentally ill.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, taxpayers, and appellants, Nebraska Department of Natural Resources and natural resources districts (the districts), challenged the judgment of the District Court for Lancaster County, Nebraska, finding that L.B. 701(1)(d) (Neb. 2007) (Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2-3225(1)(d) (Reissue 2007)) was unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Nebraska was a party a water compact, which allotted an annual number of acre-feet of water for beneficial consumptive use. The Nebraska Governor issued a press release that L.B. 701 was passed to create a cash fund that could be used to help Nebraska continue to comply with the compact and agreements. The districts were given the power to issue bonds for the purpose of acquiring water rights, and could then repay the bond debt by imposing a property tax levy under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2-3225(1)(d). The court held that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2-3225(1)(d) violated the prohibition against levying a property tax for State purposes and was unconstitutional. The purpose behind Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2-3225(1)(d) was for the purpose of maintaining compliance with the compact, which was a State purpose. Neb. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1A, prohibited the State from levying a property tax for State purposes. The failure to include property taxes raised under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2-3225(1)(d) from being used for the operation of the districts suggested the revenue would be channeled elsewhere, arguably to meet the expenses associated with the State's obligation to comply with the compact.</SPAN></P>

The District Court for Lancaster County, Nebraska, affirmed. The accountant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accountant argued that the Board did not have subject matter jurisdiction over him because the only service he provided to clients was the completion of tax returns. The supreme court found that the accountant used the &quot;CPA&quot; designation in his advertising and, therefore, submitted himself to the Board's jurisdiction. The rules adopted by the Board did not enlarge or modify the Public Accountancy Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1-105 to 1-171 (Reissue 2007). The Board was authorized to promulgate rules which allowed it to meet the purpose of ensuring the competency of persons practicing public accountancy. The accountant had sufficient notice as to the rules he allegedly violated. The accountant's First Amendment argument was not presented to the district court for consideration and could not be considered on appeal. The accountant's claim that there was no nexus between his actions and the practice of public accountancy lacked merit as a person could not knowingly impersonate another and make false statements without tainting the individual's reputation as a CPA and the reputation of the profession as a whole.

The Lancaster County District Court, Nebraska, reversed the Commission's decision. The Commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue in this case was whether the elected official violated Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 49-14,101.02 (Reissue 2004) of the NPADA by being filmed in his government office for the purpose of creating a video advertisement for his reelection campaign. The court concluded that the official's actions did not violate &sect; 49-14,101.02. The court found nothing in the statute indicating that it should stretch the meaning of &quot;use&quot; to its broadest possible application - to a case where nothing was &quot;consumed&quot; and the actions did not create any impression of a conflict of interest. The Commission was unable to persuasively explain how the official's actions represented any of the problems the NPADA sought to address. While the Commission suggested that the official was utilizing an &quot;unfair advantage&quot; of his incumbency, the court found that the official was merely conveying something that most of the public already knew and that the official had a right to convey to those who did not. The official would not have been sanctioned had he simply rebroadcast news footage showing him working in his office. There was no meaningful distinction between such a scenario and what happened in this case.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-1347.01. The Board agreed with the taxpayers. Appellee county assessor appealed to the Tax Equalization and Review Commission (TERC), which reversed the Board's decisions. The Board appealed, and two of the four taxpayers cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the 2007 tax year, the properties had been considered agricultural land and qualified for greenbelt status under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-1344. As a result of an amendment to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-1359 (Cum. Supp. 2006), which defined agricultural or horticultural land, and pursuant to its authority under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 77-1347 (Cum. Supp. 2006) and 77-1347.01 (Supp. 2007), the county assessor's office reevaluated certain properties receiving greenbelt status. Pursuant to this evaluation, the county assessor recommended disqualification of the greenbelt status for each of the properties. The Board assigned that TERC erred in finding the primary use of each parcel was not for commercial agricultural use. The supreme court concluded that the Board's failure to consider the use of the entire parcel in determining whether the property was agricultural was unreasonable and arbitrary. The supreme court could not conclude that reversing the Board's decisions was in error. One of the taxpayers contended that Neb. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents challenged a judgment of the Juvenile Court of Douglas County (Nebraska) taking jurisdiction over the parents' minor child, under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-247(3)(a), for the refusal of the parents to obtain mandatory newborn screening of the baby, under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 71-519 to 71-524.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' son was born at home and was not screened for eight metabolic and genetic disorders, as required the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) The parents claimed that the taking of a blood sample from their baby was contrary to their sincerely held religious beliefs. The child was removed from the parents' home by DHHS as a child at risk of harm, under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-247(3)(a). The court considered the appeal under the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine because the validity of the newborn screening statutes involved the health and welfare of all children born in Nebraska. The court held that the newborn screening statutes,&nbsp;Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 71-519 to 71-524 (Supp. 2007), did not violate the parents' rights to the free exercise of religion, under Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 4. However, under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-247(3)(a), the State was required to prove a risk of future harm by a preponderance of the evidence. The fact of failure to test under the newborn screening statutes, standing alone, did not establish neglect. Thus, the juvenile court did not acquire jurisdiction over the baby, and its orders for testing and detention were a nullity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court's actions in erecting a screen between the victim and defendant violated his due process rights to a fair trial. The supreme court noted that while the court placed the screen in the room out of genuine concern for the victim, that concern was precisely the threat to defendant's right to a fair trial. Whether the victim really had reason to fear defendant, because he had abused her, was the essential subject that the jury had to determine--based solely on the evidence properly adduced at trial. The insertion of the screen into the courtroom created a risk that this did not occur. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-1926 (Cum. Supp. 2004) specifically provided for various means of obtaining the victim's testimony through pretrial videotaping or closed circuit video from another room. The trial court erred in admitting the witness's alleged hearsay testimony because it was not explained how the effect of the statement on the witness was relevant to an issue in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university argued that the district court erred in finding that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81-8,305 (Reissue 2003) was constitutional and that the contractor was entitled to recover under the total cost method of damages, in applying the contract's equitable adjustment provision to all of the contract work items, and in failing to limit the adjustment to work units 9 through 11. The supreme court found nothing in Neb. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 9 which limited a claimant's right to have the claim examined and adjusted by the district court. The claimant was given the right to appeal a decision of the State Claims Board to the district court, but that was not a limitation on how the claim was to be examined and adjusted. The district court properly found that the contract specifications in work units 9 and 11 did not limit the unit price to 15 percent above the actual disposal costs, as argued by the university. The district court erred in not awarding the contractor the full amount of the contract. The university was not without a remedy, as the contract allowed it to seek an equitable adjustment while the work was being performed.</SPAN></P>

He waived the right on appeal to assert prejudicial error concerning evidence received without objection. There was no plain error in the admission of the test results. The trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant's offer of proof of an expert witness to show the importance of a source code to challenging the breath test results. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow defendant to withdraw his plea. The evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's determination that defendant was driving while having a concentration of at least.08 of 1 gram or more by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of his breath.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, age 14, testified that she had sexual intercourse with defendant, age 22, who was on probation from two other instances of sexual intercourse with girls. Defendant argued that he was prejudiced by the consolidation of these proceedings. Consolidation facilitated a prompt consideration of the revocation charge. The requirements of the Nebraska Probation Administration Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2267 (2005), were met because his adduction of evidence was not hampered by the consolidation. An expert's testimony that the victim showed evidence consistent with rough sex was not subject to a Daubert inquiry because it was not opinion testimony. The district court properly refused to permit cross-examination of the victim's prior juvenile adjudication, her false statement to an officer, and other kinds of misconduct, pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 27-608(2). The Confrontation Clause did not require the district court to permit the use of juvenile adjudications for general impeachment of credibility, absent an offer of proof suggesting a motive for bias.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 71-147(8) (2003) and the dentists' failure to maintain a controlled substance log for Triazolam was a ground for discipline under &sect; 71-147(10), (17) (2003). The dentist argued that the State denied him procedural due process during the disciplinary procedures, but the dentist failed to present a record supporting any alleged errors and failed to file with the clerk a notice of a constitutional question, as required by Neb. Ct. R. App. 2-109(E). Because of the dentist's procedural defaults, the court would not address his due process claims. The dentist also contended that the revocation of his license was an inappropriate sanction for his alleged offense. The court concluded that revocation was an appropriate sanction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners alleged that in establishing the boundaries for a State game refuge, the DNR exceeded its statutory authority, deprived them of their constitutional right to due process, and effected a taking of their property without just compensation. The appellate court ruled that the trial court erred in concluding that the landowners did not state a claim for relief, insofar as they alleged that the boundary effected a taking without just compensation. The landowners sufficiently alleged in their complaint that despite neither permanent physical invasion of their property nor a complete deprivation of all the economically beneficial use of their property, they were nevertheless entitled to compensation for the deprivation of their right to make economically viable use of their property. Also, when read in context, it was evident that the Nebraska Legislature did not intend Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-706 (Reissue 2004) to either include or exclude man-made waterways from the banks of the river. Instead, the Legislature intended to delegate to the NDR the responsibility for determining whether any particular waterway should be considered part of the banks of the river.</SPAN></P>

In each case, the City of Omaha sought a declaration that the agreements, which had been negotiated by the City of Elkhorn prior to its annexation by the City of Omaha, were not valid because they violated Neb.

The court ruled that jurisdiction existed over the matter, and that the severance provisions were enforceable and the payments made under the severance provisions were not unconstitutional gratuities. The severance provisions were determined prior to the services rendered and were supported by adequate consideration. The City of Elkhorn and subsequently, the City of Omaha, benefited from the claimants' decisions to remain in their positions and to carry out their employment responsibilities up to and until the time that their services were no longer needed, and the claimants' suffered the detriment of forgoing new employment opportunities until after their employment was terminated.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-726 (Reissue 1997) and to provide pre-suit notice to the city prior to filing his lawsuit seeking unpaid wages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After filing a claim with the city administrator for unpaid wages, the former employee filed suit against the city, claiming that the city failed to compensate him for wages earned prior to the termination of his employment. The city moved for summary judgment, claiming that the employee failed to comply with the notice requirement of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-726 (Reissue 1997). The district court granted the motion and dismissed the employee's cause of action. On review, the court held that, under the clear statutory language, the filing of a notice of claim was a condition precedent to an action against the city. The court further rejected the employee's contention that his claim letter submitted to the city administrator constituted substantial compliance with Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-726. While a substantial compliance analysis applied when there was a question regarding the sufficiency of the claim's contents, the substantial compliance analysis was not applicable where the notice was not filed with the person designated by statute as the authorized recipient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the petitioner raised several issues challenging the dismissal of his case. The supreme court found that a commutation was required by statutes in effect when the petitioner committed the crime (Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 83-1,110 (Cum. Supp. 1969)), just as it was required under the current statutes (Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 83-1,110 (Cum. Supp. 2006)). As such, ex post facto principles were not implicated, contrary to the petitioner's contention, and the petitioner was not eligible for parole until the Board of Pardons commuted his sentence to a term of years. That the Board of Pardons had exercised its discretionary authority and granted commutations for other life inmates after they served, on average 17 or 18 years, did not give the petitioner a protectable liberty interest in having his sentence commuted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bar owner sued appellee city, alleging that the city's ordinance prohibiting smoking in most public places and places of employment within its city limits violated the special privileges and immunities clause of Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 18. The Douglas County District Court, Nebraska, concluded that the ordinance was constitutional and granted the city's motion for summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court concluded that the trial court erred in finding exemptions to the ordinance were not special legislation. The exemptions included standalone bars, keno establishments, horseracing simulcasting locations, and tobacco retail outlets. The ordinance's stated purpose was to recognize the right of everyone to breathe smoke-free air in order to protect the public health and welfare. Nothing in the ordinance's stated purpose would explain why employees of the exempted facilities or members of the public who wished to patronize those establishments were not entitled to breathe smoke-free air or to have their health and welfare protected. Nor did the city offer any other admissible evidence which might support this distinction. On the record before it, the instant court determined that there was no substantial difference of circumstances to suggest the expediency of diverse legislation. The instant court did not hold that similar exemptions could not be constitutionally justified--just that, given the record in this instance, the exemptions in this particular case were not. The city's argument that it was permitted to enact its smoking ban in phases was rejected.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's convictions were affirmed, but due to recent U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the death sentence was vacated. After a jury found the existence of an aggravating circumstance, a three-judge panel resentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant challenged his resentencing, arguing, inter alia, that electrocution was cruel and unusual punishment. A three-judge panel after defendant's trial and a jury after the case was remanded for resentencing unanimously found that the State proved the exceptional depravity aggravator beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the supreme court concluded that electrocution would unquestionably inflict intolerable pain unnecessary to cause death in enough executions so as to present a substantial risk that any prisoner would suffer unnecessary and wanton pain in a judicial execution by electrocution. Besides presenting a substantial risk of unnecessary pain, the supreme court concluded that electrocution was unnecessarily cruel in its purposeless infliction of physical violence and mutilation of the prisoner's body. Electrocution's proven history of burning and charring bodies was inconsistent with both the concepts of evolving standards of decency and the dignity of man. The supreme court ruled that death by electrocution as provided in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2532 (Reissue 1995) violated the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county enacted a zoning regulation that prohibited the construction of single-family dwellings within certain distances of animal feeding and waste handling facilities, unless the owner of the dwelling granted an impact easement to the owner of the facility and the owner of the facility agreed to the easement. The primary issue on appeal was whether the regulation, requiring that the granting of the easement be &quot;mutual,&quot; constituted an unauthorized delegation of legislative authority to private citizens. The instant court concluded that the district court erred in finding that the mutual impact easement language in the zoning regulation constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. The regulation simply afforded the owners of animal feeding and waste handling facilities a limited opportunity to waive a restriction created by the county. The regulation provided the prohibition on the construction of single-family dwellings within certain distances of animal feeding and waste handling facilities could be overcome, but only if both parties were able to agree to a mutual impact easement.

The supreme court found that Neb. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court for Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska, convicted defendant of first degree murder, kidnapping, first degree sexual assault on a child, and use of a firearm to commit a felony. The sentencing panel sentenced defendant to death for first degree murder, life imprisonment without parole for kidnapping, to 40 to 50 years' imprisonment for sexual assault, and 20 to 25 years' imprisonment for the firearms conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's motions where defendant had no absolute right to plead guilty. The use of the prior sexual assault of another victim to prove an aggravating circumstance did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. There was no reversible error in overruling defendant's motions to excuse jurors for cause. Defendant did not show that a change of venue was necessary, because an impartial jury was selected, and he could not show that he could not receive a fair trial. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2523(1)(a), (b), and (d) were not unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. A jury did not have to find mitigating circumstances, weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances, or have further input in determining the sentence. The jury did not have to make unanimous findings of fact. The court did not err in granting defendant's motion to waive counsel and appear pro se at sentencing. The court did not err by receiving evidence of the guilt and aggravation phases of the trial in the sentencing hearing. The imposition of the death sentence was proportional to that in the same or similar circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Knox County District Court, Nebraska, which convicted him of robbery and use of a firearm to commit a felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The main issue on appeal was whether the district court had jurisdiction over the robbery that occurred in Indian country. Defendant claimed that his arrest, detainment, and prosecution violated article I of the 1868 Treaty between the United States of America and different Tribes of Sioux Indians and U.S. Const. art. VI. The instant court concluded that the district court had jurisdiction over defendant's prosecution. By enacting Public Law 280 (codified at 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1162(a)) in 1953, Congress intended to subject Indians to Nebraska's jurisdiction and criminal laws and to abrogate any inconsistent treaty provisions. The district court did not err in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing on defendant's motion to allow trial counsel to withdraw and to appoint substitute counsel. The district court properly determined that the State made sufficient proof of identity to use a 1977 South Dakota robbery conviction to enhance defendant's sentence. The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution did not require Nebraska to recognize South Dakota's treatment of the 1977 conviction as &quot;expunged&quot; for enhancement purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of making terroristic threats for telling his girlfriend she was going to die during an argument. The court of appeals contended that it lacked jurisdiction to hear an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Defendant then sought review. In affirming, the supreme court determined that cases involving the constitutionality of a statute were not heard by the court of appeals under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-1106(1) and Neb. Const. art. V, &sect; 2. However, the constitutional issue had to be real and substantial. Where a law had been held constitutional by the supreme court, the court of appeals had jurisdiction since the case merely required an application of unquestioned constitutional provisions. To the extent that Metro Renovation v. State, 249 Neb. 337, 543 N.W.2d 715 (1996), held otherwise, it was disapproved. Next, counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the constitutionality of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-311.01 based on the failure to define the term &quot;terror.&quot; Similar challenges had already been rejected; the words &quot;terror&quot; and &quot;terrorize&quot; were words of common usage and meaning capable of being readily understood by an individual of common intelligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The caseworker argued that the nature of her qualified immunity meant that the use of the summary judgment motion for asserting qualified immunity initiated a special proceeding in the federal courts. The supreme court noted that the denial of a summary judgment motion was not a final order for purposes of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;25-1902. A summary judgment proceeding was not itself an action but was merely a step in the overall action and was not a special proceeding. The denial of a claim of qualified immunity, where the issues presented were purely questions of law, were immediately reviewable under the collateral order doctrine. The caseworker was acting in a discretionary function as an employee of DHHS. With respect to the client's allegation of violations under the Fourth Amendment, he failed to allege a legally cognizable claim for the violation of such a right. The client did not contend that the caseworker arrested him. The district court failed to address the client's claim of familial integrity, which prevented the supreme court from using the collateral order doctrine to decide whether the caseworker violated the established constitutional right alleged by the caseworker.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary of State rejected three state legislators' filings for placement on the ballot because he determined that they were ineligible to serve a third consecutive term under Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 12. The voters alleged that &sect;&nbsp;12 operated to keep &quot;only certain senators&quot; from filing their candidacy, which prohibited their supporters from voting for the candidate of their choice. The supreme court noted that not all restrictions imposed by the states on candidates' eligibility for the ballot imposed constitutionally suspect burdens on voters' rights to choose among candidates. A layperson would understand from the plain language of Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 12(1) that a legislator was disqualified to serve another for another consecutive term after the expiration of two consecutive terms. Under &sect;&nbsp;12(3), if more than one-half of the legislator's then-current term was served after the effective date, the term would count toward disqualification for a third term, but not otherwise. The voters failed to show that the full-term calculation required a different application for incumbent and non-incumbent legislators.

The instant court concluded that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2-3235(1) (Cum. Supp. 2006) gave the district express authority to enter into the agreement with the developers to construct the dams. The trial court properly excluded evidence of the proposed bill, which would have allowed the district to enter into cost-sharing agreements with developers in connection with dam and reservoir projects. Whether the district believed, or even questioned, that it lacked authority to enter agreements with developers was not relevant to whether it had such authority under current Nebraska law. The district did not violate Neb. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 3, by entering the agreement because it did not lend or give state credit by agreeing to pay for the dams.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pleaded guilty to third degree assault, the Lancaster County District Court, Nebraska, overruled defendant's demand for a jury trial and ordered him to pay restitution pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2280 (Reissue 1995). Defendant appealed the order of restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from a bizarre incident in which he attempted suicide and the bullet ricocheted off his skull and struck his girlfriend in the chest. Defendant argued that under the U.S. Supreme Court's holding in Blakely v. Washington restitution was a penalty above the prescribed statutory maximum for his offense and that a jury had to determine restitution. The court agreed with defendant that restitution was criminal punishment. However, defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was not violated by the order of restitution. The trial judge's factfinding in determining restitution did not expose defendant to any greater punishment than &sect; 29-2280 authorized, which was for the full amount of the victim's actual damages. The trial judge could properly order restitution because defendant admitted that he had recklessly caused bodily injury to the victim. Because defendant's conviction authorized restitution for the full amount of the victim's losses, the trial judge's factfinding to determine restitution did not result in punishment that exceeded any statutory maximum imposed on defendant's punishment. Thus, Blakely did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the district court erred in permitting a forensic interviewer witness to testify that she had no concerns during her interview of the child victim that the child was not telling the truth. The supreme court disagreed. The witness had been cross-examined in depth regarding her decision not to administer the truth-or-lie ceremony to the victim. The question and answer were obviously in the context of explaining on redirect examination why the witness did not utilize the truth-or-lie ceremony with the victim. Nonetheless, it was improper for the prosecutor to inquire of the witness whether the victim might or might not have been telling the truth in a certain instance. However, the error was harmless. The effect of the witness's single statement was not to vouch for the credibility of the victim, but simply to explain why she departed from the standard interview form in her interview of the victim. Considering the context in which the statement was made, the guilty verdict rendered was surely unattributable to any error in permitting the statement on redirect and such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The term misconduct, as used in Grand Island, Neb., City Ordinance ch. 2, art. II, &sect; 2-22, was not unconstitutionally vague as it carried a common enough meaning to satisfy the requirements of due process. Specifically, the term was generally defined to include, inter alia, behavior that evidenced wanton and willful disregard of the employer's interest, deliberate violation of rules, disregard of rightfully expected standards of behavior, or negligence that manifested culpability. The allegations of misconduct with which the director had been charged did not constitute misconduct because the allegations of unsatisfactory performance, incompetence, and insubordination were not categories of job performance that were commonly understood to be misconduct in an official capacity. Moreover, the director's decision not to post a memorandum on the wall did not rise to the level of misconduct. The circumstances with respect to the delayed implementation of a 911 surcharge presented, at most, a disputed case of ordinary negligence in the performance of duty. Ordinary negligence was not the equivalent of culpable negligence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court concluded that the Board had exercised judicial functions and that the jurisdictional requirements for the timely filing of a petition in error were met. The evidence was sufficient to support the Board's finding that cracked brick walls constituted unsafe structures in violation of Omaha, Neb., Municipal Code ch. 48, art. I, &sect; 48-71(1) (2003) However, there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that the furnaces were in violation of the Code. There was no showing that the furnaces were dangerous, and the application of municipal ordinance inspections and permit requirements was not authorized by statute. Regulations relating to the use of gas appliances had been given exclusively to the Metropolitan Utilities District. There was clearly insufficient evidence that stucco, point, and paint items were unsafe, unfit, or unlawful following admissions at the hearing that these matters were cosmetic issues.</SPAN></P>

The Lancaster County District Court, Nebraska, dismissed the coalition's claims pursuant to Neb. Ct. R. Pleading Civ. Actions 12(b)(6). The coalition appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The coalition argued that the funding system inadequacy violated the free instruction clause, Neb. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, and the religious freedom clause, Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 4. On appeal, the coalition argued that the district court erred in determining its claims were nonjusticiable and therefore failed to state a cause of action. The instant court concluded that the organization's claims presented nonjusticiable political questions. The relationship between school funding and educational quality required a policy determination that was clearly for the legislative branch. The Nebraska Constitution committed the issue of providing free instruction to the legislature and failed to provide judicially discernible and manageable standards for determining what level of public education the legislature was required to provide. The instant court could not make that determination without deciding matters of educational policy in disregard of the policy and fiscal choices that the legislature had already made. Nor could it impose a constitutional standard of a &quot;quality&quot; education without ignoring the people's clear rejection of such a standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On its own motion, the Supreme Court of Nebraska reconsidered its order for the issuance of a death warrant for appellant on the ground that another case on its docket raised the constitutional question of whether electrocution remained constitutional under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court's jurisdiction was not exhausted by the rendition of its judgment, but continued until that judgment was satisfied. Thus, notwithstanding the issuance of the death warrant, the court retained jurisdiction to suspend the execution of the death sentence. Moreover, the court's unique constitutional responsibilities imposed a heightened standard of vigilance as it administered and supervised implementation of the death penalty. Although there was little question that appellant had received due process of law and the court had previously concluded that his claims to the mode and protocol of execution were barred, the issuing of a warrant ordering his electrocution implicated different responsibilities for the court and placed the case n a different procedural posture. Had the court properly considered those responsibilities, it would not have ordered the issuance of a death warrant in light of the changing legal landscape as to the continuing vitality of the constitutionality of electrocution. Although appellant had not asked for a stay, a stay was nonetheless warranted to ensure the integrity of death sentences in the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents argued that the district court erred in sustaining the school district's motion for summary judgment. The supreme court found that the residents' claim--that a transfer of authority to issue bonds  was not permissible under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79-422(1) (Reissue 2003)--was really an argument that the State Committee should not have approved the petition and plan because of this provision. But the State Committee did approve the petition and plan, and the residents apparently did not exercise their right to judicial review either by petition in error or by appeal pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79-413(4). The issue of statutory construction which the residents now sought to raise could have been resolved in such a review proceeding, but neither the supreme court nor the district court had jurisdiction to address it in this collateral proceeding.

The district court properly denied defendant's motion to obtain DNA samples from other suspects as Neb. Rev.

Defendant's statements to the police were properly admitted as she was not in custody at the time of two interviews. Admission of an inmate's testimony did not violate Neb. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Nebraska State Patrol Retirement System, Public Employees Retirement Board (the Board), State of Nebraska (the State) and director of the Board, challenged the order of the District Court for Lancaster County, Nebraska, ordering the retirement benefits of appellees, retired officers of the Nebraska State Patrol, be recalculated on 240 sick leave hours per year instead of 108 hours under the contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found that by reducing sick leave included in the officers' retirement annuities, the State bargained a retirement program, which was prohibited under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81-1377(2) (Reissue 1997). The reviewing court held that the number of sick leave hours included in the calculation was not a retirement program and the State did not impair the officers' contractual rights. Although unused sick leave hours included in the retirement calculation did affect the annuity, the specific number of hours did not constitute a retirement program under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81-1377(2). The number of hours was a variable used to calculate the annuity, and many factors similarly affected the amount of the annuity. The specific number of sick leave hours was no more a part of an officers' retirement program than their salaries. Also, while the waiver of sovereign immunity in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-21,206 (Reissue 1995) did not specifically mention class actions, the reviewing court found that it was broad enough to encompass class actions. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-21,206 did not limit the procedure for contract claims against the State so that only individual actions were permitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and child moved to Nebraska after the mother was granted sole custody in Canada. After returning from visitation, the child made an allegation of sexual abuse. The Canadian court refused to cede jurisdiction over the case to Nebraska. The district court denied the mother's motion to assume jurisdiction. This appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court determined that Canada maintained exclusive continuing jurisdiction over the issues of custody and visitation under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1240. The mother's preemption argument did not arise because the controversy at question did not involve the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, Oct. 25, 1980, T.I.A.S. No. 11,670, 1343 U.N.T.S. 89, (reprinted at 51 Fed. Reg. 10494 (Mar. 26, 1986)), as implemented by the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 11601 to 11611. The mother's contention that the UCCJEA was unconstitutional under Neb. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 1, 9, 19 was rejected as well. Finally, the mother's due process and equal protection rights under Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 were not violated based on the fact that the hearing would have taken place in Canada.</SPAN></P>

The landowner then sought review. In affirming, the supreme court held that contractual provisions for attorney fees were against public policy if such fees were not provided for by statute or a uniform course of procedure. Next, several equitable doctrines did not change the decision. Some of them did not apply to actions at law. Moreover, the tenants did not waive a challenge to the validity of the fee provision by signing the contract. There was no evidence that the tenants acted inequitably, unfairly, or dishonestly in making their initial claim for attorney fees. Judicial estoppel did not apply because the district court never accepted the claim that the attorney fee provision in the lease was applicable. There was no judicial admission based on the pleadings either. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-824 (Reissue 1995) only provided for attorney fees for actions brought in bad faith; therefore, there was a public policy against granting fees in actions that were not frivolous.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the father filed a paternity action in district court, the district court determined he was the biological father of the child. The district court ordered the father to pay child support and granted him visitation. Over 1 year later, with the consent of the mother, the stepfather filed for adoption. The county court determined that the father's consent to the adoption was not required because the father failed to comply with Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 43-104.02 and 43-104.05 (Reissue 2004). The issue was whether the father, who had previously been determined in a paternity action to be the biological father, was required to comply with the registry statutes to preserve his rights in a subsequent adoption proceeding. The reviewing court held that applying Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-104.22(7) (Reissue 2004) infringed upon the father's constitutionally protected parental rights. Because the father had provided support and established familial ties with his biological child, his interest in personal contact with his child had acquired substantial protection.

The personal representative, the putative paternal grandmother, moved for a revivor of the father's action after it was dismissed. The district court denied the motion, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court held that certain actions did not abate on the death of a party, pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 25-1401, 25-1402 (Reissue 1995). In such cases, substitution of a personal representative was permitted under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;25-322 (Reissue 1995). The supreme court determined that paternity actions involved purely personal rights, and revivor was not permitted. Moreover, the mother's act of requesting genetic testing after the father's death did not result in a waiver of abatement since the action ceased to exist absolutely after his death. Finally, the representative did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of Neb. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the sentencing judge erred in fixing an identical minimum and maximum term of imprisonment. The court concluded that the sentencing judge pronounced an indeterminate sentence in which the minimum and maximum terms were the same, but it found no statutory requirement that the affirmatively stated minimum term for a Class IB felony sentence be less than the maximum term. Although Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2204(1)(a)(ii) (Cum.

Accordingly, defendant's argument that his sentence was impermissible under the applicable sentencing statutes was rejected. The court also concluded that the minimum life sentence imposed upon defendant did not restrict or usurp the parole board's constitutional power.

Stat. &sect; 32-1412 (Reissue 2004), appellant registered voter sought an injunction preventing appellee Nebraska Secretary of State from placing an initiative measure to authorize video keno on the ballot at the 2006 general election. The Lancaster County District Court, Nebraska, denied relief to the voter and dismissed the action, thereby permitting the initiative to remain on the ballot. The voter appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter argued that the trial court erred in concluding that the video keno initiative did not violate the resubmission clause of Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 2. The instant court concluded that the resubmission issue related to the regulation of the initiative process itself and, being of a procedural nature, was justiciable prior to the election. Because the initiative was not the same in essential substance as two initiatives submitted in 2004, the resubmission clause did not bar the video keno initiative from being placed on the 2006 general election ballot. The instant court also concluded that the intricate and complex issue raised regarding the potential constitutional problem of the initiative under the games of chance and lottery provisions in Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 24, was a substantive constitutional challenge, did not relate to the initiative process itself, and was not suitable for preelection review. The legislative power reserved to the people in Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 2, was similar to that of the legislature and, regardless of the merits of proposed voter initiatives, such initiatives were to receive the same judicial deference as proposals before the legislature.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 86-316 to 86-329 (Cum. Supp. 2004), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Telecommunications company services intervened in opposition to the subscribers. The court affirmed and held that the primary purpose of the NTUSFA was not to generate revenue for governmental purposes but to regulate the telecommunications industry through a rebalancing and restructuring of rates. The surcharge that was implemented by the Nebraska Public Service Commission (PSC) was imposed only on end-user revenues from telecommunications services, and payments from the Fund were made only to eligible telecommunications companies for the purpose of provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services for which the support was intended under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 86-324(1). Thus, the court concluded, the surcharge assessed by the PSC pursuant to the NTUSFA was not a tax. Also, the provisions that authorized the PSC to establish the goal of universal service constituted reasonably adequate, sufficient, and definite standards for the guidance of the agency in the exercise of the power conferred upon it and enabled those affected to know and understand their rights and obligations. The NTUSFA was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the PSC.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Nebraska Secretary of State challenged a judgment of the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska) that granted mandamus relief for appellee, resident voter serving as ballot committee president, and ordered the Secretary to place a &quot;casino initiative&quot; on the ballot. The president challenged the denial of relief as to a &quot;K-12 initiative&quot; on the ground that it contravened the resubmission clause in Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary refused to place the initiatives on the ballot for the 2006 election on the grounds that they were so similar to initiatives in the 2004 election that they contravened the resubmission clause. On appeal, the court held that a justiciable issue had been presented because the question was whether the initiatives were legally sufficient to be submitted to the voters. The court found that the resubmission clause barred both initiative measures from being placed on the ballot. The court held that the essential substance of the casino initiative was the same as a 2004 initiative, known as &quot;Initiative 417&quot; in that it proposed to amend Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 24 to permit games of chance. The court found that the essential substance of the K-12 initiative was the same as the 2004 initiative, known as &quot;Initiative 419,&quot; which was enacted into law, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9-901 to 904 (2005), and dealt with taxing new games of chance and earmarking the proceeds for education. The court held that the application of the resubmission clause did not violate the right to free speech or present ballot access issues because it was merely a limitation on the initiative process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the trial court judgment that held the &quot;casino initiative&quot; did not violate the submission clause and vacated the order requiring the Secretary to place it on the ballot. The court affirmed the portion of the judgment that held the &quot;K-12 initiative&quot; violated the submission clause. The court remanded the case with directions to dismiss the complaint for writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the deceased victim's mother identify her from a photograph, even though the victim had already been identified by the physician who treated her and the mother cried while doing so, because the mother's testimony was brief and the jurors were instructed not to allow sympathy or prejudice influence their verdict. The mother's testimony that the victim went to the university to play soccer was relevant to the circumstances under which she and defendant came to be in the same place at the same time, and her testimony that the victim's hobby was collecting shot glasses was relevant to the circumstances that led directly to the fatal shooting.</SPAN></P>

The State claimed that the district court reached the right result for the wrong reasons and that the district court erred in reaching the merits of appellant's claims and in failing to find that he was procedurally barred from raising the claims. The supreme court found that the use of electrocution as an issue relative to a sentence of death was known to appellant and that he could have litigated this issue on direct appeal from the resentencing. This issue was procedurally barred. Appellant's petition as it pertained to the electrocution procedure issue did not seek to set aside his death sentence and that he did not claim that the judgment was void or voidable. Appellant did not file the case as a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action but instead filed for relief under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-3001 (Reissue 1995). An issue of constitutional dimension involving a sentence did not constitute grounds for postconviction relief unless it also constituted grounds for finding the sentence void or voidable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In county court and on appeal to the district court, defendant unsuccessfully maintained that the 1998 conviction could not be used for enhancement purposes because it was not a prior conviction as defined in Neb.

The reviewing court held that defendant's 1998 DUI conviction was valid for the purpose of sentence enhancement and that defendant was attempting to collaterally attack that conviction. Inherent in defendant's 1998 conviction was a determination that the Omaha DUI ordinance to which he pled no contest and under which he was convicted was enforceable, and inherent in that determination was a finding that the city ordinance under which he was convicted was &quot;in conformance with&quot; the state statute under Neb.

The driver of the vehicle was the child's grandfather. The Douglas County District Court, Nebraska, rejected the parents' challenge to the constitutionality of Nebraska's guest statute,&nbsp;Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-21,237 (Reissue 1995). A jury found in the driver's favor on the issue of gross negligence. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents argued that the trial court erred in failing to find the guest statute to be unconstitutional. The instant court concluded that the parents failed to establish that the guest statute was unconstitutional and that the trial court did not err when it concluded that the guest statute was constitutional and dismissed the parents' theories of recovery based on simple negligence. The guest statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Nebraska Constitution, Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, because it was rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of preventing fraud and collusion. The legislature could rationally have concluded that close relatives were more likely than other guests to collude with the driver in order to perpetrate a fraud. There was no indication that the legislature's decision to minimize opportunity for fraud and collusion by limiting application of the guest statute to certain relatives was a result of invidious discrimination. The guest statute did not constitute special legislation in violation of the Special Privileges and Immunities Clause of Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>

III, &sect; 17, the court was called to try articles of impeachment against defendant university regent brought by plaintiff Nebraska Legislature regarding alleged violations of false reporting under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-907 (Cum. Supp. 2004) and obstruction of government operations under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-901 (Reissue 1995) regarding an investigation by the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission (NADC).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was elected, complaints were filed with the NADC. Plaintiff alleged that after the NADC initiated an investigation, defendant concealed of the actual date that he expended 40 percent of his maximum estimated expenditures for the general election. The court found defendant guilty and held that because criminal conviction was not at stake, defendant's due process rights were fully protected by a clear and convincing standard of proof. The evidence showed that in the primary and general elections, defendant intentionally delayed filing his 40% affidavits in an effort to ensure that his opponents did not timely receive public funding. The court found that defendant's omission of an expenditure from his October 2004 campaign statement was deliberate and his intentional conduct of filing his 40% affidavit late could have subjected him to criminal charges. The court found defendant's explanations not credible and contradicted by his own testimony. The court also found that the false statement filed after the investigation began was intended to deflect the NADC's investigation away from the accrued expense and, thus, to impede the investigation of a criminal matter.</SPAN></P>

The District Court for Lancaster County, Nebraska, sentenced defendant to 5 to 10 years' imprisonment, and ordered him to pay restitution. Defendant filed a postconviction action and was granted a new direct appeal. Pursuant to that order, defendant filed a direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In February 2002, defendant and three other men broke into a convenience store and stole an automatic teller machine (ATM) belonging to a bank. The men loaded the ATM into the back of their pickup truck, and after driving to an abandoned farmstead, opened the ATM using a cutting torch. The ATM contained $ 10,360, which the men split evenly among themselves. Defendant argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to challenge the constitutionality of the criminal restitution statutes. The reviewing court held that Nebraska's criminal restitution statutes were not unconstitutional, thus, the failure of trial counsel to challenge such statutes before the sentencing court was not prejudicial to defendant's defense. Restitution, ordered in an amount not exceeding the actual damage sustained by the victim, pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2280 (Reissue 1995), was not a penalty within the meaning of Neb. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5 and was constitutional. Also, the imposed sentence was not excessive and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering such sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff purchasers of handicapped parking placards sued defendant State for charging a $ 3 fee for the placards. The Lancaster County District Court, Nebraska, determined that the fee violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12134 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and enjoined future collection of the fee. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that in the context of charging a fee for handicapped parking placards, Congress did not validly abrogate Nebraska's immunity under the 11th Amendment. Abrogating 11th Amendment immunity under the ADA to invalidate a fee for a parking placard was not congruent to the specific findings of Congress, which were concerned with denial of fundamental rights in providing public services. Nor was the remedy proportional to those findings when the fee appeared to be a modest cost-recovery measure and there was no evidence of animus toward the class. Although the purchasers argued that the fee affected their access to public services, the court declined to stretch a modest $ 3 fee into a denial of a fundamental right. The fee did not prevent physical entry into a public building, and nothing in the record suggested that members of the class had been denied access to public accommodations because of the fee. The fee was a rational method of modest cost recovery in a program meant to assist the disabled. The court rejected as meritless the purchasers' argument that the fee was an illegal tax or a taking of property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his convictions and sentence.

The damaging effect of the statement was removed by the trial court's proper admonition to the jury. The court held that evidence of appellant's returning from Houston and of the truck being burned in a field in Houston was intrinsic to the crimes for which he was charged. The court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order the State to grant immunity to the witnesses who invoked their right against self-incrimination. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for mistrial, based on the State's alleged discovery violation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three principles emerged from federal precedent: (1) there was a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children, (2) in light of that presumption, a fit parent's decision concerning the denial of grandparent visitation was to be accorded at least some special weight, and (3) notwithstanding that special weight, the presumption in favor of fit parents was rebuttable. Under a strict level of scrutiny, Nebraska's grandparent visitation statutes,&nbsp;Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1801 et seq. (Reissue 2004), were not unconstitutional on their face under either U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Specifically, the Nebraska statutes limited the parties and circumstances in which those parties could seek visitation and the showing grandparents were required to make was consistent with the principle that a fit parent was presumed to act in the best interest of the child. The statutes were not unconstitutional as applied to the mother given the clear and convincing evidence showing the paternal grandparents' significant beneficial relationship with the child and that visitation did not adversely interfere with the parent-child relationship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its appeal, the city argued that the district court erred in concluding that the vehicular pursuit of the fleeing motorist was the proximate cause of the passenger's injury and damages under Neb.

The instant court concluded that there was ample evidence that the pursuit set in motion a series of events that resulted in the passenger's injuries. Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that the passenger's injuries were proximately caused by the actions taken by the officer during the pursuit. Although the passenger contended that the statutory cap on damages denied him equal protection in violation of Neb. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee motorists in two cases appealed decisions by appellant Nebraska Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) revoking their driver's licenses for refusing to submit to chemical testing for the unlawful presence of alcohol or drugs. The Clay County District Court, Nebraska, reversed the license revocation in each case and declared Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-498.01 (Reissue 2004) facially unconstitutional. The State appealed the district court's rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court concluded that the district court erred in ruling that the provisions in &sect; 60-498.01 pertaining to refusal to submit to chemical testing violated the motorists' due process and equal protection rights. With respect to the motorists' due process claims, both motorists were given a copy of a form notifying them that their licenses would be revoked in 30 days because reasonable grounds existed to believe they were driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and because they had refused to submit to a chemical test of blood, breath, or urine. The form also provided instruction on how to request a hearing before the DMV. Hearings were held at which the motorists were given the opportunity to present evidence. Thus, the constitutional requirements of due process were met in both cases. With respect to the motorists' equal protection claims, the instant court concluded that &sect; 60-498.01 did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Nebraska Constitutions by treating motorists who refused to submit to chemical testing differently than motorist who submitted to, but failed, such testing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With respect to one of the motorists, the instant court remanded with directions to reinstate the administrative suspension of that motorist's driver's license. With respect to the other motorist, the instant court remanded for further proceedings with directions to determine whether that motorist's arrest was valid.</SPAN></P>

The manufacturer argued, inter alia, that the verdict was excessive and the result of passion and prejudice. The supreme court disagreed. The evidence established that plaintiff was unemployable and would incur an ongoing loss of income for the rest of her projected life expectancy of 45 years from the time of trial, which she would live as a quadriplegic. The jury was properly instructed as to the items it could consider in determining the amount of damages. The list included, inter alia, the reasonable value of medical care and supplies actually provided and reasonably certain to be needed in the future, lost wages, the reasonable value of the earning capacity plaintiff was reasonably certain to lose in the future, and the reasonable monetary value of the physical pain and mental suffering she had experienced and was reasonably probable to experience in the future.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, voters and a school district, claimed that L.B. 126's effective date for orders dissolving the school districts violated various constitutional provisions. The court disagreed. Appellees failed to show that they had a clear right to relief which supported a permanent injunction. Absent a showing that L.B. 126 violated some provision of the state or federal Constitution, the court was not free to enjoin or strike down laws enacted by the legislature. The court noted that the people of Nebraska had unambiguously set forth in Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 3, that an act of the legislature would be suspended only in the event that a referendum petition was signed by not less than 10 percent of the registered voters. There was no dispute that appellees collected the signatures of only a little more than 7.7 percent of the voters. Thus, to suspend &quot;the taking effect&quot; of L.B. 126 pending the referendum vote required the court to ignore the will of the people as clearly expressed in the state Constitution. To the extent appellees argued that the effective date of L.B. 126 illustrated a need to change the referendum process, such was for the people of Nebraska to decide, not the court.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the amended complaint did not change the offense charged and that the defendant was never misled as to the charge against him where the first complaint correctly stated all of the statutory elements of the offense.

The mother failed to make a threshold showing that as to the burden of proof for the termination of parental rights, she was treated differently from others similarly situated. Also, the juvenile court was not divested of jurisdiction to terminate the mother's parental rights during the appeal of the termination the father's parental rights to child B.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by not granting his motion for mistrial because of the prosecutor's misconduct. The appellate court noted that the prosecutor's repeated misrepresentation misled the jury, leaving the false impression that defendant admitted he was guilty of third degree assault. Having made the statement on rebuttal, defendant's counsel had to sit silently without an opportunity to correct that impression. The trial court's admonition left the jurors to ponder why they were free to make up their minds about the first statement, but not the second. The trial court abused its discretion by overruling defendant's motion for mistrial. Defendant could be retried without violating double jeopardy because the evidence admitted was sufficient to sustain his convictions. Because the State provided no reason why defendant's identity would be reasonably prudent to the victim's diagnosis and treatment and because the doctor suggested that it was not, the doctor's recitation contained inadmissible hearsay. The court should instruct the jury, on retrial, using the applicable subsection from the restraint definition in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-312.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the trial court erred, inter alia, by failing to grant a new trial because of newly discovered evidence. The instant court concluded that the record showed that much of the newly discovered evidence concerned problems that arose after appellant was sentenced. The record showed that had the evidence been available at the time appellant waived his rights and pled guilty, the trial court would have reached the same conclusions. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied appellant's motion for new trial. Regarding appellant's assignments of error concerning his death sentence, appellant brought his motion to vacate his death sentence as a separate special proceeding. The instant court concluded that the addition of a new special procedure for raising issues of a void sentence was unnecessary and could lead to additional delay in the final resolution of cases. Therefore, it declined to recognize a new special procedure for raising the issue of a void sentence. Because the issue was not raised in a recognized proceeding, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the claim. Thus, the instant court also lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The Sarpy County District Court, Nebraska, denied the landowners' requests. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners argued, inter alia, that the district court erred in finding that the city's ordinance was a valid exercise of the city's zoning power. The instant court concluded that the landowners' assignments of error were without merit. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-901 (Reissue 1997) provided the city with the power to adopt zoning regulations. A resolution adopted by the city was administrative rather than legislative in nature and effectively amended the city's CDP. The challenged ordinance was a valid exercise of the city's zoning power. Although the landowners contended that they were not given a meaningful opportunity to protest the components of the development project, a review of the record revealed that they had chances to voice their concerns in various settings. The landowners were given adequate opportunities to make their elected officials aware of their concerns. Although the landowners argued that the rezoning was done for the sole benefit of the developers, the landowners failed to overcome the presumption that the city acted within its zoning power and did so in pursuit of the health, safety, and welfare of the city's residents.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed his sentences were erroneous because L.B. 1 (Neb. 2002), which amended Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-105(1), the sentencing statute, violated Neb. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed his sentences of life imprisonment without parole were unconstitutional because they were prescribed by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-105(1), the Class IA felony penalty statute that was amended by L.B. 1 (Neb. 2002), which did not fall within the legal scope of the legislative session.  The court held that the amendment was not related to or germane to any of the purposes for which the legislative session was called because the Governor's proclamation was narrow and specific, authorizing consideration of changes to existing death penalty statutes and there was nothing in the proclamation which could be construed as authorizing the Legislature to amend a statute pertaining to life imprisonment. Thus, the court held that the 2002 amendments to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 28-105(1) and 29-2520(1), which inserted the phrase &quot;without parole&quot; after &quot;life imprisonment&quot; contravened the constitutional directive in Neb. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8 that the amendments be related to or germane to the purposes for which the legislative session was called.

Stat. &sect; 79-422(1) was constitutional, and that the bond issues and reorganization petition were &quot;lawful in all respects.&quot; On appeal, the court found that the resident had filed an impermissible collateral action, thus it did not have jurisdiction over her appeal. The court disapproved of Kosmicki v. Kowalski, 184 Neb. 639, and ruled that because the State Committee's approval of the petition, &quot;adversely affected&quot; the resident within the meaning of Neb. Rev.

The city urged the supreme court to interpret recreational purpose to include spectating at a youth football game. The issue was whether the city was immune from liability under the RLA. The supreme court held that it was not because the driver did not enter or use the city's land for &quot;recreational purposes,&quot; as that term was defined by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-729(3). The court declined to follow the Ohio line of cases. Consistent with the doctrine of ejusdem generis, the supreme court had construed &sect; 37-729(3) such that the specific terms listed in the statute restricted the general term of &quot;recreational purposes.&quot; Dykes compelled the court to hold that spectating at a youth football game was not a recreational purpose under the RLA. The driver's spectating was not substantially similar to the enumerated activities in &sect; 37-729(3), as it was not a physical activity and required no &quot;active involvement&quot; on the part of the driver.

Stat. &sect; 28-1463.03 was unconstitutional because it violated his due process right to privacy. The supreme court disagreed. The State, in regulating child pornography, was free to define children as persons under the age of 18, even if the age of consent was lower, as long as the law passed traditional rational basis review. Even for those who record an intimate act and intend for it to remain secret, a danger existed that the recording could find its way into the public sphere, haunting the child participant for the rest of his or her life. It was reasonable to conclude that persons 16 and 17 years old, although old enough to consent to sexual relations, might not fully appreciate that today's recording of a private, intimate moment might be the Internet's biggest hit next week. It was reasonable to conclude that criminalizing the making of recordings depicting persons under 18 years of age engaged in sexually explicit conduct furthered the goal of protecting those persons from the reputational harm that would occur if the recordings were distributed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 29-3601 through 29-3609 (2004) purported to authorize and regulate pretrial diversion programs. The supreme court concluded that the power to design a formal pretrial diversion program was a legislative function and that thus, &sect;&sect; 29-3601 through 29-3609 did not violate the separation of powers clause. Sections 29-3601 through 29-3609 regulated the prosecutor's ability to design a formal diversion program as he or she saw fit. The county attorney argued that the power to design a formal pretrial diversion program was an executive function, and he relied on the power of prosecutorial discretion and that the charging function was also broad enough to allow him to formalize diversion practices. But, the supreme court concluded that formalizing the diversion process was something separate and apart from the mere exercise of the charging function and was better understood as a legislative function. Formal pretrial diversion did not represent a natural outgrowth of the charging function, but, rather, a substantial change in the way society responded to crime. Thus, the district court erred in holding that &sect;&sect; 29-3601 through 29-3609 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The waste hauler was a licensed solid waste hauler that controlled an estimated 20 percent of the solid waste in Lincoln, Nebraska. Instead of hauling the waste to the Lincoln-operated public landfill, it hauled Lincoln-generated waste to the landfill company, which according to the hauler, charged less than the disposal fee charged at the Lincoln landfill. The hauler's deportation of waste outside the city negatively affected the revenues collected by the city landfill, so the city enacted Lincoln, Neb., Ordinance 18149, which imposed an occupation tax of $ 7 per ton on all refuse collected within the city. Appellant unsuccessfully challenged the ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the ordinance gave equal treatment to in-state and out-of-state haulers and was not a burden on interstate commerce; rather, it was a burden on intrastate commerce, which was not protected under the dormant Commerce Clause. The court found no Equal Protection Clause violation either because the city offered a rational basis for exempting non refuse haulers: it wanted to encourage households to bring their trash to the landfill as opposed to illegal dumping along the roadside.</SPAN></P>
