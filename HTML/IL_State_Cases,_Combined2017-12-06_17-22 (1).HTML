</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for failing to use a turn signal. When he was unable to produce a valid driver's license, he was arrested, and his vehicle was searched incident to arrest. In addition, an officer saw a large white object that looked like a white brick on the floor of defendant's car. The officer's experience led him to believe the object might be cocaine. The object was retrieved, and defendant was advised of his rights, after which he remained silent. Approximately two hours later, he was interviewed by an assistant State's attorney, who advised him of his rights. He agreed to speak to the assistant State's attorney and gave a brief statement, which he later sought to suppress. The search of defendant's vehicle was both a valid search incident to arrest and a plain view search. His statement to the assistant State's attorney was admissible because his Miranda rights had been &quot;scrupulously honored.&quot; When he failed to appear at the resumption of his trial, the court was authorized under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/115-4.1(a) to continue with the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">City passed an amusement tax ordinance after cinema purchased land and opened a movie theatre. Cinema filed an action which alleged the tax was unconstitutional because it targeted expressive conduct for special treatment and city had no compelling governmental interest to justify the tax. The trial court granted summary judgment to city, finding that the tax was content neutral and did not suppress any particular type of expression. The appellate court noted the ordinance was not tailored to single out cinema or movie theaters as a group of first amendment actors. The ordinance applied to all amusements within the city and the appellate court concluded that there was a rational relationship between the increased burden on city as a result of cinema and city needed to raise revenue to meet that burden.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to driving while his license was revoked (DWR), a subsequent offense felony, under 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/6-303(d). The Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois) sentenced him to six years in prison and ordered him to pay a reimbursement fee for the services of the public defender, pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/113-3.1. Defendant's post-conviction petition was dismissed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not err by entering the reimbursement order without first conducting a hearing to determine defendant's ability to pay. The failure to comply with the provisions of 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/113-3.1 violated Illinois statutory law but did not constitute any deprivation of federal or state constitutional rights, much less a &quot;substantial&quot; one. Moreover, defendant was required to not only establish a substantial deprivation of federal or state constitutional rights, but that the deprivation occurred in the proceedings that produced the judgment being challenged. The reimbursement order was not cognizable under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-1 to 122-8, because it was the result of ancillary proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed McLean County Circuit Court (Illinois) drug conviction and sentence, arguing that confrontation rights were violated by admission of lab report pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/115-15 (1998) and that sentence was unconstitutionally increased without jury determination by imposing consecutive sentences under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(h) (1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial on drug possession charges a lab report identifying packets found in his possession as crack cocaine was admitted without objection. The court held that even though 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/115-15 (1998) had later been held unconstitutional, defendant could not challenge admission of the lab report, without more, on appeal, because he failed to object at the time. Because one of defendant's offenses was committed while he was on pretrial release in another case, he received a consecutive sentence pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(h) (1998). The court noted that Illinois case law had already determined that imposition of a consecutive sentence was not an enhanced punishment for which a jury finding that such punishment was warranted beyond reasonable doubt was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. Defendant never challenged admissibility of the lab report, and prior case law had determined that consecutive sentencing provisions were not increased punishment provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant one and defendant two had simultaneous trials before two different juries. They appealed from the judgments of the Circuit Court of Cook County, that convicted them each of first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, and aggravated battery with a firearm. Defendants claimed, inter alia, that gang-related testimony presented at trial was improperly admitted, and that the trial court violated Apprendi in sentencing them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial evidence established that defendants were gang members, that one of them shot and killed a victim, and that defendant one shot and wounded a second victim, who identified both defendants at trial. After simultaneous but severed jury trials, both defendants were convicted of first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, and aggravated battery with a firearm. The appellate court held that some testimony from a gang member and from a gang crimes specialist, who testified as an expert, was hearsay, but found the error harmless as other evidence of guilt was overwhelming. Gang-related testimony from the specialist was a proper subject of expert testimony, and the evidence was more probative than prejudicial, as it supplied the motive for otherwise inexplicable shootings. The State's last minute adding of a witness was not a discovery violation. The evidence was sufficient to convict defendant two for aiding and abetting the crimes, and his speedy trial rights were not violated, as the delays were attributable to him. But the consecutive sentences for both defendants, and defendant one's enhanced sentence for murder, were reversed for violating the Apprendi rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of conviction were affirmed. The orders requiring both defendants' sentences to run consecutively were reversed. As to defendant one, his sentences of 80 years for first degree murder and 40 years for attempted first degree murder were vacated and the case was remanded for a sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee petitioned to terminate the parental rights of appellant regarding her minor children. The Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois) found appellant unfit, and determined that it would be in the children's best interest to terminate appellant's parental rights. Appellant challenged the decision, arguing that the finding of unfitness was against the manifest weight of the evidence, and other errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An investigator found appellant's residence to be filthy, with the floors covered with cat feces, cat litter, and clutter to such a degree that the floors were impassible. In moving to terminate respondent's parental rights, appellee alleged appellant substantially neglected the children in a continuous or repeated fashion and other grounds. The appellate court held the trial court erred in finding substantial neglect that was continuous or repeated pursuant to 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 50/1(D)(d) (1999). The appellate court held that to constitute substantial neglect under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 50/1(D)(d) (1999), incidents of neglect would have to fall somewhere beyond the midpoint of the continuum but would not necessarily have to be extreme. The appellate court held the incidents of neglect contained in the record were of a kind frequently found in neglect cases, and nothing suggested extreme circumstances. The appellate court held that 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 50/1(D)(h) (1999) was unconstitutionally vague, as the statute did not adequately inform persons of ordinary intelligence what conduct constituted grounds for unfitness, and because it permitted arbitrary prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a jury trial in the Circuit Court of De Kalb County (Illinois), respondent was found to be a sexually violent person under the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 207/1 et seq., (act). The court ordered respondent committed to a secure facility with a number of directives to the Illinois Department of Human Services (department). The respondent and the department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, respondent argued that the act was unconstitutional, and that the State failed to prove that he was a sexually violent person beyond a reasonable doubt. The department argued that the trial court erred when it ordered it to retain a private physician and subjected the department to that physician's supervision. The appellate court found that the act did not violate substantive due process, and that terms used therein were not vague nor otherwise unconstitutional. There was sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict. The appellate court also found that the trial court had jurisdiction over the department and that the trial court's orders were not barred by sovereign immunity. However, the trial court's order that the department provide treatment in accordance with the report of a specific doctor exceeded the court's authority and conflicted with provisions of the act which authorized the department to operate the facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment declaring respondent a sexually violent person was affirmed. The trial court's commitment order was affirmed in part and vacated in part and the case was remanded for entry of an amended commitment order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the circuit court, Sangamon County (Illinois) which convicted defendant of attempt, home invasion, and armed robbery. Defendant was sentenced to 15 years in prison for home invasion, 20 years for armed robbery, to run consecutively to the home invasion sentence, and 35 years for attempt, to run concurrently with the armed robbery and home invasion sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's conviction and sentencing, defendant appealed arguing that (1) the trial court erred by (a) denying his motion in limine seeking to bar the State from introducing evidence of his flight, and (b) admitting certain evidence; (2) the prosecutor made improper statements during closing argument; and (3) a portion of the Unified Code of Corrections, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(a) (1998), was unconstitutional under the United States Supreme Court's Apprendi decision. The appellate court found that, based on the evidence presented, the jury reasonably could have inferred that defendant knew that he was a suspect and he consciously avoided police. Therefore, evidence of flight was properly admitted. The appellate court found further that when viewed in the context of the closing arguments as a whole and the evidence presented at trial, the prosecutor's remarks were neither improper nor substantially prejudicial to defendant. Finally, the appellate court noted that it was aware of no constitutionally cognizable right to concurrent, rather than consecutive, sentences. Defendant's other points of error were overruled. As such, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After remand, a jury found defendant guilty of burglary for the theft of a cell phone. The Circuit Court of Vermilion County (Illinois) sentenced defendant as a Class X prior felony offender under former 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3(c)(8). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that first, because the Apprendi standard was decided while defendant's case was pending on appeal, defendant could not have raised the Apprendi standard in his post-trial motion. Second, the court found that under &sect; 5-5-3(c)(8), the trial court was required to sentence defendant as a Class X offender because he had prior felony convictions, which did not elevate the class of the crime but merely set forth criteria under which defendant was to be sentenced. The prior convictions providing the basis of defendant's enhanced sentence were obtained through proceedings with substantial procedural safeguards, from which the dates of the actions underlying the convictions could be ascertained. Accordingly, the Apprendi standard did not render &sect; 5-5-3(c)(8)&nbsp;unconstitutional. Finally, even if the Apprendi standard applied, the error would have been harmless. The evidence was overwhelming both as to defendant's age and the dates of the commission of the prior felonies. Thus, the failure to ask the jury to determine defendant's age and the dates the prior felonies were committed was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment action requesting that the Illinois Education Expense Credit Act (Act), 35 Ill.

Defendant and intervenors filed motions to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint. The trial court granted the motions to dismiss. Plaintiffs appealed. The appellate court held that the Act was constitutional, because: (1) the tax credit at issue did not involve an appropriation or use of public funds; (2) the Act allowed Illinois parents to keep more of their own money to spend on the education of their children as they saw fit; (3) no money ever entered the control of Illinois as a result of the credit; (4) the Act had the secular purpose of ensuring that Illinois children were well-educated; (5) the credit was equally available to all parents of public or nonpublic school children; (6) funds became available to schools only as the result of private choices made by individual parents; and (7) the Act did not have the primary effect of advancing religion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested by Chicago police in Franklin Park, an area outside of the territorial limits of the authority of the police. An Illinois statute allowing such extraterritorial arrests, 195 Ill. Laws 404, was declared unconstitutional after the arrest. The police were acting without a warrant. The State argued that the police were relying in good faith on the statute and had effectuated a proper citizen's arrest. The appellate court found that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule based on an unconstitutional statute was not recognized in Illinois. Since the officers had identified themselves as police when they approached the defendant, they did not effectuate a valid citizen's arrest. The appellate court ruled that, since the arrest was illegal, statements made by the defendant to the police and certain evidence taken at the time of the arrest should be suppressed, and the appellate court remanded the case for the trial court to determine whether the illegal arrest tainted the subsequent evidence recovered by the police.</SPAN></P>

After he exhausted appeals in state court, defendant filed a habeas corpus action in federal court. The federal court ordered state courts to hold a hearing on the issue of whether prosecutors challenged potential jurors on the basis of race. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) conducted that hearing, and held that defendant's rights were not violated. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>

When the jury was sworn, three members and both alternates were African-American. The jury convicted defendant, and he appealed first in state court, and then, by writ of habeas corpus, to federal court. The federal court ordered the state courts to hold a new hearing on defendant's claim that prosecutor's preempted jurors of the basis of race. On appeal from that hearing, the state appellate court held that (1) it could review the state trial court's findings, (2) the federal court's directive that the state trial court was required to state facts on the record, and to compare the prosecutor's strikes against African-Americans to his treatment of similarly situated Caucasians was not binding on state courts, (3) the trial judge was allowed to draw upon her own opinions of a prosecutor in assessing the prosecutor's motives; and (4) the trial judge was not required to make specific findings of fact regarding each challenge the prosecutor made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicting him of attempted first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant 15-year-old appealed his conviction of attempted first degree murder, contending that due to the established unconstitutionality of the act under which his case was transferred from the juvenile division to the trial court, his conviction was to be vacated. The appellate court vacated defendant's conviction and remanded the matter to the juvenile court for a new transfer hearing, followed by further proceedings as necessary. It was conceded that the case was to be remanded for a new transfer hearing, and the dispute centered around what law was to be applied at the new transfer hearing. The presumptive transfer provision added by 1997 Ill. Laws 590 and currently in effect was procedural in nature and its retroactive application did not violate constitutional ex post facto principles. Accordingly, application of 1997 Ill. Laws 590 was proper on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) found petitioner guilty of the murder of his 93-year-old great-grandmother, among other things, and was sentenced to an extended term of 80 years' imprisonment. The judgments were affirmed on direct appeal. Petitioner appealed the dismissal of his sixth petition for post-conviction relief on the grounds that he was entitled to a fitness hearing regarding his ingestion of medication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court concluded that petitioner's claims were barred because (1) the petition was untimely, (2) the fitness issue raised in his sixth petition was barred by principles of waiver and res judicata, (3) petitioner's claim that he was taking psychotropic drugs at the time of his trial and sentencing was not supported by the record, and (4) fundamental fairness did not suggest a relaxation of the rules so as to permit consideration of any of his claims. Because post-conviction relief extended only to deprivations of constitutional rights that occurred at the proceedings which resulted in conviction and because petitioner did not raise any constitutional claim, he could not show that any of the previous post-conviction proceedings were deficient in some fundamental way. Accordingly, he was procedurally barred from bringing the petition on the fitness issue and the question of post-conviction counsel's failure to amend a previous petition. Moreover, the holding in Apprendi, regarding due process rights, could not be used to resurrect an otherwise procedurally barred successive post-conviction petition.</SPAN></P>

The court determined, first, that since the remand left no discretion in defendant, it was a final appealable order. It then examined the statute and regulations and held that they left no doubt as to the prohibitions against administration of prohibited substances. It then reviewed defendant's findings and sanctions determination solely to assure that they were not against the manifest weight of the evidence, and held that they were not.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 405/1-1 et seq., alleging abuse by appellant mother toward her child. At a permanency hearing, the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (Illinois) changed the permanency goal to substitute care, pending the court's determination on whether to terminate appellant's parental rights. Appellant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee challenged the jurisdiction of the appellate court under 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/2-28(3). The appellate court found that the provision of &sect; 2-28(3), which made any order following a permanency hearing immediately appealable, was unconstitutional. The jurisdictional problem facing the court was that a permanency goal did not finally determine the right or status of appellant, but instead, looked to the future status of the child. Only the state's highest court could provide, by rule, for appeals to the appellate court from nonfinal judgments. The legislature could only regulate the practice and set limits on the time for review. Therefore, the legislature attempted to define appellate jurisdiction over a nonfinal order, in violation of the state constitution's separation-of-powers clause. The court concluded that the invalid portion of the statute was not interconnected with the rest of the statute and could appropriately be stricken while the remainder of the statute was left intact. Thus, the court did not have jurisdiction as the order was not a final, appealable order.</SPAN></P>

Laws 1418 (repealed Nov. 30, 1990) was found unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Principals sued the school board for damages claiming they were deprived of their rights to continued employment and denied salary and other benefits pursuant to actions taken under a statute concerning tenure which was later held unconstitutional in its entirety by the Illinois Supreme Court. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the trial court granted the school board's motion. The appellate court held that the effect of finding the statute unconstitutional was to leave the law in force as it was before the adoption of the amendment. This meant that the principals were tenured and could not be terminated without cause after a hearing. In addition, the school board generally admitted the existence of an employment relationship with the principals. Finally, the appellate court found that the school board's responses to interrogatories were not judicial admissions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.

The appellate court found the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give appellant's second-degree-murder instruction, because appellant did not present sufficient evidence to warrant the instruction. Further, the appellate court found the trial court properly ruled the prior charge for which the witness received court supervision could not be used to impeach her credibility. Finally, the appellate court determined the effect of the trial court's finding under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(b) was to expose appellant to a greater punishment than authorized by the jury's guilty verdict.

Defendant also claimed ineffective assistance of counsel and that the consecutive sentencing provision of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(b) was unconstitutional. The appellate court found from the facts that the arrest was supported by probable cause and the subsequent search was valid. As there was no prejudice to defendant, there was no claim for ineffective counsel. The appellate court found that the trial court's recoupment hearing did not comply with 725 Ill. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved the trial court to reconsider sentence following his guilty plea. The trial court denied the motion and defendant took an initial appeal of that denial. While that appeal was pending, an amendment to the insanity defense statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/6-2(a), was declared unconstitutional, which defendant asserted should have made available to him a defense under &sect; 6-2(a). In the first appeal defendant requested the appellate court for leave to withdraw his guilty plea, which was denied. In the second appeal defendant argued that his guilty plea was not knowingly made because of the later invalidity of the insanity defense statute. The appellate court held that as defendant's appeal was taken from, and therefore limited to, the denial of his motion to reduce sentence, no other issue, including any issue related to the withdrawal of a guilty plea, was preserved for appeal. This was a final decision in defendant's case, and the new rule declaring the statute amendment unconstitutional did not apply retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reaffirmed its previous order that defendant should not be granted leave to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) to grant defendants' motion to dismiss and deny plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment in a constitutional challenge to a mandatory court filing fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a class-action complaint asserting they were required to pay a mandatory arbitration fee in matters that were ineligible for arbitration. The mandatory arbitration program authorized collection of a filing fee from each litigant in all civil cases which utilized the system, regardless of whether a particular case was arbitrable or not. The appellate court held the fee was proper because it was imposed for purposes relating to the operation and maintenance of the courts and benefited the overall administration of justice by easing the backlog of cases in the circuit courts. Also, the fee satisfied the free access clause because the fee served solely to improve the overall administration of the court system. Plaintiffs did not meet their burden of showing the fee was arbitrary or unreasonable, having failed to show it was overinclusive or underinclusive. In addition, the fee did not violate the uniformity or equal protection clauses of the Illinois Constitution. Finally, plaintiffs' fundamental rights were not violated because the mandatory arbitration fee did not impinge upon choices about marriage or family life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), Defendant was convicted of attempted first degree murder, aggravated criminal sexual assault, and aggravated kidnapping. He appealed his sentence of confinement for a total of 120 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of attempt first degree murder, aggravated criminal sexual assault, and aggravated kidnapping for raping, repeatedly beating, and impaling his victim by inserting a tree limb into her vagina, the trial judge sentenced defendant to 50 years confinement for the attempt, 50 years confinement for the sexual assault, and 20 years confinement for the kidnapping, and ordered that the sentences be served consecutively. The appellate court held that (1) defendant did not waive his right to challenge his sentence on appeal because he failed to raise that challenge in a post-trial sentencing motion; (2) the trial judge erred by imposing extended sentences for attempt first degree murder and aggravated criminal sexual assault because the aggravating factors he used were not charged in the indictment or proved by the prosecution; and (3) although other divisions of the Appellate Court of Illinois had ruled that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(a), the statute that allows a trial judge to impose consecutive sentences, was unconstitutional, the court was not bound by those rulings and it would join Illinois courts which had found the statute constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the portion of the trial court's sentencing order requiring that the sentence imposed for each offense run consecutively. However, the appellate court reversed the portion of the trial court's sentencing order requiring that the sentences for attempted first degree murder and aggravated criminal sexual assault be extended, and remanded the case with instructions to impose statutorily required sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) dismissed defendant's second postconviction petition, finding it frivolous and patently without merit. Defendant appealed, arguing that &sect; 5/122-2.1 of the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-2.1, was void because the public act that created &sect; 5/122-2.1 supposedly violated the single subject rule of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-2.1 empowered trial courts, prior to appointing counsel, to dismiss frivolous or patently meritless postconviction petitions. Defendant asserted that 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-2.1 was void ab initio because the public act, 1983 Ill. Laws 6200, which created the statute and its first-stage dismissal procedure violated the single subject rule. The appellate court held that (1) because defendant failed to argue the unconstitutionality of the public act in his second petition he could not raise the single subject rule issue in the appeal from the denial of that petition; (2) res judicata also barred his raising the single subject rule issue because he failed to raise that issue in the appeal of the denial of his first petition; and (3) even if defendant's single subject rule issue were reviewable, the public act in question did not violate that rule because all five sections of the act clearly related to the single subject of the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' driver's licenses were summarily suspended pursuant to procedures at 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-501.1 (1998) when they refused breathalyzer tests. Trial court orders sustaining their constitutional objections to suspension were vacated by the state's supreme court, but on remand, the trial court again granted rescission, ruling that defendants had been denied the 46-day notice period before suspension when they were renotified, and that the prosecution had failed to act timely to reinstitute proceedings. The intermediate reviewing court construed the summary suspension statute, and held that the 46-day period began running when defendants refused their tests, and that due process was satisfied when they received their initial hearings. Vacatur of the original judgments simply reinstated suspensions that were already valid, so the prosecution needed to do nothing further to effect the suspensions. Defendants whose non-constitutional arguments for rescission had never been addressed might still raise them on remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded for further proceedings, including any hearings required on defendants' non-constitutional grounds for rescission of suspensions. Since the earlier judgments granting rescission were void, the original suspensions were simply reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Adams County (Illinois), following a jury trial, found defendant guilty of aggravated battery, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-4(a), (b). She was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment. The trial court also ordered a 50 percent wage deduction to pay costs and restitution. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Addressing the six issues argued by defendant, the appellate court found that the order for 50 percent of defendant's monthly wages from the department of corrections to be withheld was void and thus, vacated. The procedure employed did not comport with the civil procedure for wage deduction under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-6(h). It was not disputed that no wage deduction proceeding was conducted. However, the appellate court affirmed the judgment in all other respects finding that the trial court did not err by: (1) using the mere-fact method for prior conviction impeachment; (2) finding defendant guilty of aggravated battery beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) giving the issues instructions to the jury without including the term &quot;great bodily harm;&quot; (4) imposing an extended sentence under 730 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the judgment which ordered the wage deduction was vacated as void.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs in proposed class action appealed from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) grant of summary judgment to defendants in their suit for alleged misuse of toll bridge revenues to fund non-bridge projects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were users of a toll bridge paid for by municipal bonds and run by defendant city. Toll collection was authorized to repay the bonds and pay operation costs. Plaintiffs sued defendant city and its bond trustee over the city's practice of financing nonrelated projects with bridge tolls. They alleged takings, equal protection, due process, and other issues, both federal and state, and sought class certification. A federal court dismissed the federal claims. The circuit court granted defendants' summary judgment motion. Defendants contended the toll bridge was not subject to the common law duty to limit its toll revenue to its operating costs because it was not the type of enterprise to which the duty applied, and the tolls were authorized by home rule authority and state statute. The appellate court affirmed. Defendant city was acting within its home rule power. The state's uniformity clause, Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 (1970), did not extend to tolls, which were not taxes. The distinction between who must pay tolls and who did not was not an arbitrary classification, given the voluntary nature of use. The court did not reach the takings or laches issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. The common law duty to charge reasonable rates did not apply to toll bridge. Defendant city was acting within its home rule unit power when it used bond sales revenue to fund nonrelated improvements. It did not violate the uniformity clause. Use of tollway was voluntary and not an exclusive route. Its use did not create an adhesion contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) convicted defendant of aggravated battery in a place of public accommodation, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-4(b)(8) (West 1998), and the trial court sentenced defendant to an extended term of nine years in prison, based on his prior convictions, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(1) (West 1998). Defendant appealed the conviction and the sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that plaintiff State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not act in self-defense, and that the extended-term sentencing provision set forth in 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(1) (West 1998) was unconstitutional pursuant to the Apprendi doctrine. Defendant was involved in an argument with another person in a convenience store. The victim told defendant to leave. Defendant left the store, and then returned and became involved in a fight with the victim. The appellate court held the right of self-defense did not justify a person in committing an act of retaliation or revenge, or did the right permit a person to pursue and inflict injury upon an initial aggressor after the aggressor abandoned the altercation. Several witnesses testified that defendant instigated the fight, and that defendant hit the victim from behind after the victim had withdrawn. The appellate court held the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not act in self defense. The court held the sentencing provision in question did not violate the Apprendi doctrine, as prior convictions constituted an exception to the doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was originally charged with predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, but the State amended the indictment to charge aggravated criminal sexual assault because the former crime did not exist under Illinois law at the time of petitioner's offenses. Since the offenses had exactly the same elements and carried the same penalties, the court held that the amendment was merely a matter of form. However, the indictment also charged the offense of sexual penetration, which was not supported, as the State conceded, by any evidence in the record. Therefore the court vacated that conviction and sentence. Finally, a new constitutional rule requiring jury involvement before sentences longer than the statutory maximum for individual offenses could be imposed did not apply to petitioner, because it was clear that his sentences fell within an exception to the new rule, applied where the sentencing court imposed longer sentences based on prior convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part, because amendments to indictment were merely formal and trial court properly supported its decision to impose consecutive sentences, but vacated petitioner's conviction and sentence on one charge, sexual penetration, that was not supported by any evidence.</SPAN></P>

Const. arts. I, &sect; 3; X, &sect; 3; VIII, &sect; 1(a); and IX, &sect; 2, to defendant tax agency's enforcement of 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/201(m) (1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/201(m) (1999) provided for defendant agency to allow a tax credit to parents of qualifying pupils to cover a portion of education expenses. Plaintiff parents and taxpayers attacked the constitutionality of the statute, most prominently under Ill. Const. arts. I, &sect; 3; X, &sect; 3, which were equivalent to the federal establishment clause of U.S. Const. amend. I. The court held that whether it applied establishment clause standards of the 1970's or later standards, the tax credit remained constitutional, because it had a clearly secular legislative purpose of ensuring a well-educated citizenry and relieving public expense, had a primary effect of effectuating those purposes, as opposed to advancing or inhibiting religion, and involved no more governmental entanglement with religion than many other tax laws. The credit also complied with constitutional limitations on use of public funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed dismissal, because the challenged tax credit met standards applicable to challenges under establishment clause.

The appellate court found that merely because an act discussed multiple subjects did not necessarily mean that it violated that portion of the Illinois Constitution which mandated single subject thesis for Illinois laws passed by the state legislature. Further, the appellate court found that merely because various members of the state legislature object to the inclusion of a section of a bill, it did not demonstrate that the eventual law violated the single subject clause of the Illinois Constitution. As such, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Southwestern Illinois Development Authority (SWIDA) used its power of eminent domain under 70 Ill. Comp. Stat. 520/1 et seq. (West 1998) (the Act) to transfer ownership of property from appellants, a not-for-profit religious corporation, to a limited partnership composed of private investors. The limited partnership sought to acquire the land to build a multimillion-dollar mixed-income residential complex while the appellants purchased the land for the development of the Muslim community. Appellants challenged the circuit court's decision that approved SWIDA's eminent-domain quick-take action and argued that SWIDA's power under the Act was unconstitutional. The court found that the property taken was located in the heart of a blighted area and included unoccupied and unattended slums. The exercise of eminent-domain powers for the purpose of eliminating slums or blighted property was a proper use for a valid public purpose. The court found that the condemnation and transfer of property to the limited partnership would bring the kind of positive change that was contemplated by the Act, which was to eliminate slums and blight.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff chiropractor appealed from the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) order affirming sanctions imposed on him by defendant regulatory department and its director for violating &sect; 26 of the Medical Practice Act of 1987, 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. 60/26 (Supp. 1999), by having in his waiting room a booklet containing testimonials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed an administrative complaint against plaintiff chiropractor, alleging, inter alia, that he violated the advertising provisions of &sect; 26 of the Medical Practice Act of 1987, 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. 60/26 (Supp. 1999), by displaying in his office waiting room a 27-page booklet entitled &quot;Our Patients Speak,&quot; which contained preprinted forms entitled &quot;My Chiropractic Story,&quot; which were filled out by patients. An administrative law judge (ALJ) found the booklet contained testimonials, in violation of the statute. The medical disciplinary board adopted the ALJ's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations, and ordered plaintiff to pay a $ 2,500 fine. The circuit court upheld the decision. The appellate court reversed, finding testimonials were not inherently misleading, the booklet constituted protected commercial speech under the U.S. Const. amend. I, and prohibiting use of the booklet violated plaintiff's free speech right. A complete ban on testimonials was not in proportion to the State's admittedly important interests and was unnecessarily and disproportionately broad in the scope of communication it prohibited.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decision was reversed, as court agreed with plaintiff that defendants' decision violated his right to free speech by prohibiting his use of the booklet containing testimonials. If a testimonial was not misleading, not false, and not deceptive, then a governmental ban of it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, the Circuit Court of the 12th judicial Circuit, Will County, Illinois, convicted defendant of armed robbery, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 5/18-2(a) (West 1996), and sentenced him to a 10-year term of imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a convenience store, wearing a mask and carrying a sawed-off shotgun, and demanded the contents of the cash register. Prior to trial, defendant's counsel took a job with the prosecution. The appellate court affirmed the conviction and sentence. 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 5/107-3 (West 1996) authorized ordinary citizens to make arrests, so long as there was reasonable grounds to believe that the person had committed an offense. The officer, based upon the radio bulletin, had reasonable grounds to believe that defendant had committed armed robbery. Thus, the officer had the authority to stop defendant outside of his jurisdiction. Defendant's motion to quash the arrest was properly denied. Further, the appellate court found counsel's solemn promise and the trial court's order were sufficient to safeguard defendant's right to a fair trial. Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion to refuse to appoint a special prosecutor. Finally, there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's assignment of weight to the various sentencing factors, or did the court improperly consider defendant's use of a sawed-off shotgun as a factor in aggravation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because the trial court committed no error in denying defendant's motion to quash arrest as the officer had authority to stop defendant outside of his jurisdiction under the authority granted to ordinary citizens to make arrests. Further, there was no abuse of discretion in refusing to appoint a special prosecutor. Finally, defendant's sentence was not manifestly disproportionate to the nature of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Despite previous unsuccessful appeals of aggravated sexual assault convictions, defendant sought to raise additional issues on rehearing. The court quickly dispatched his speedy trial argument. There was no trial court abuse of discretion in charging defendant with responsibility for delays while awaiting DNA test results. It was his choice to wait for them. If the trial court had insisted on proceeding, there would have been a Brady violation. There was no U.S. Const. amend. XIV due process violation in imposing consecutive sentences under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4 (1994), which required consecutive sentences where the trial court found a continuing course of conduct involving offenses such as defendant's, despite a constitutional rule requiring jury determination where consecutive sentences resulted in a greater sentence than the statutory maximum, because, in the absence of finding a continuing course of conduct, the trial court had the discretion to impose consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied rehearing, reaffirming its previous determination that there was no abuse of discretion in trial court's determination that defendant was chargeable for DNA testing delays. Imposition of mandatory consecutive sentences resulted in no longer sentences than would have been permissible in absence of statutory application.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Sangamon County, Illinois, dismissed the case on defendants' motion. Plaintiff then filed an amended complaint and defendants responded with a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted defendants' motion, and plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a convicted murderer was denied parole, he filed an action which alleged that the parole board had entered a secret agreement to change the way it applied statutory standards when considering parole for convicted murderers, and that this change violated his constitutional rights. He also alleged that decisions of the Illinois Prisoner Review Board were arbitrary, capricious, and against the manifest weight of the evidence. The appellate court held that (1) defendants' motion for summary judgment on the first count of plaintiff's amended petition should have been treated as a motion to dismiss under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-615(a); (2) plaintiff's claim that the board informally changed standards that it used to make parole decisions for convicted murderers raised an issue of whether his rights under the ex post facto provisions of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and Ill. Const. art I, &sect; 16, had been violated; (3) plaintiff was entitled to engage in discovery to prove his allegations; and (4) plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss, entered by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), in a case where defendant was charged with first degree murder, he entered into a plea agreement to plead guilty and received a 52-year sentence, and the State had the agreement vacated because it learned the sentence did not conform to the statutory sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was charged with first degree murder for beating to death the son of his live-in girlfriend on December 13, 1996. Defendant and the State entered into a plea agreement under which the trial court sentenced defendant to 52 years in prison. Shortly thereafter, the State moved to vacate the plea and sentence on the ground that defendant's sentence did not conform to the statutory sentencing guidelines. Under the prior first degree murder sentencing statute, defendant would have been eligible for a 20-60 year sentence. However, the amended first degree murder sentencing statute,&nbsp;730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii), mandated that defendant serve a life sentence. The amended statute went into effect on July 21, 1995. The State's motion was granted. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. Since the plea agreement could not be legally enforced, it was void ab initio. The trial court had no choice but to vacate the sentence and, in doing so, defendant's double jeopardy rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because the legislature's 1995 amendment of the applicable sentencing statute subjected defendant to a mandatory life term rather than the previous sentencing statute's lesser sentence. Withdrawal of the plea agreement was permissible since the agreement was void ab initio and had not been judicially enforced. Also, withdrawal of the agreement did not violate double jeopardy as it was void and no bar to defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 5/12-11, 19-3 (West 1994) and sentenced him to an extended 40-year prison term on the home invasion conviction and a consecutive 4-year term on the residential burglary conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant made a statement which confessed to entering the victim's house to steal $ 3,000 in cash. Defendant and his friends beat the victim, and the victim later died from the injuries. A jury convicted defendant of residential burglary and home invasion. The trial court sentenced defendant to an extended 40-year prison term for the home invasion conviction after the jury had reached its verdict. The appellate court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to tender a voluntary intoxication jury instruction. The conviction of the more serious offense, home invasion, stood, but the residential burglary offense was a lesser-included offense of home invasion. Defendant had to be resentenced because the factors used to impose that sentence should have been determined by a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. Defendant's conviction and sentence for residential burglary was vacated, as was his sentence for home invasion. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed. Residential burglary was a lesser-included offense of home invasion, and it was error to impose an extended sentence after the jury had rendered its verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant challenged her sentencing, entered by the Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County (Illinois), where she was charged with involuntary manslaughter of a family or household member, the jury was instructed on simple involuntary manslaughter, she was found guilty, and the trial court found defendant was eligible for enhanced and extended sentences based on factors on which the jury made no findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter of a family or household member in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9--3(f) (West 1998). Defendant had met another woman and they decided to share an apartment together. Both had small children, especially since the other woman's child, a son, was born after the two women moved into the apartment. On one occasion, defendant could not get the woman's son to stop crying, so she put her hand over his mouth. She put him in his crib where he was later found dead. Defendant was charged, but the jury was only instructed on the elements of simple involuntary manslaughter, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9--3(a) (West 1998). Defendant was found guilty. The trial court extended her sentence due to the victim's tender age and enhanced it based on the victim being a family or household member even though the jury made no finding on either the tender age or family member factors. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed the conviction, but vacated the sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. Defendant's sentence could not be extended or enhanced by the trial court based on factors on which the jury had made no finding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction on simple involuntary manslaughter affirmed, but sentence vacated and case remanded for resentencing not to exceed the statutory maximum term for the Class 3 felony of voluntary manslaughter of five years, because the trial court was not entitled to enhance or extend defendant's sentence based on factors that were not presented to the jury, and thus where the jury made no findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the 21st Judicial Circuit, Kankakee County, Illinois convicted defendant of residential burglary and possession of burglary tools. The appeals court affirmed on defendant's direct appeal. Defendant then petitioned the appeals court for rehearing to consider the constitutionality of his Class X sentence in light of the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in Apprendi.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the trial date, defendant appeared on closed circuit television and waived his right to a jury trial. Defendant was convicted in a bench trial. Defendant had four prior burglary convictions, including two for residential burglary, and three drug convictions. Defense counsel acknowledged Class X sentencing applied. Based on prior felony convictions, defendant was sentenced under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3(c)(8) (1998) as a Class X offender to 25 years' imprisonment for residential burglary, and was also sentenced to a concurrent four-year prison term for possession of burglary tools. Defendant was not deprived of substantial rights and his video appearances were not plain error. The trial court's alleged non-compliance with the 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/106D-1 directive to promulgate closed circuit television rules instead of its compliant administrative order was not error. Defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on that use of closed circuit television. The sentence was within the sentencing range and not so disproportionate to the nature of the offense to constitute an abuse of the court's sentencing discretion. Section 5/5-5-3(c)(8) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court denied the petition for rehearing and affirmed the circuit court judgment's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioned for post conviction relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp.

The trial court dismissed the petition, and appellant challenged the decision. Appellant argued the trial court erred in dismissing his petition as frivolous and without merit, that violations of the Apprendi doctrine occurred, and other claims. The court held appellant's petition was without merit, as appellant failed to provide a gist of a constitutional claim. Appellant failed to show his counsel was ineffective for failing to call alibi witnesses. Appellant offered no substantial proof to show the witnesses would have testified, or what their testimony would have been. The court held appellant's petition did not fall under Apprendi protection. The Apprendi doctrine required that any fact, other than prior conviction, that increased the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Under existing precedent, recidivist provisions did not violate the Apprendi doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision, because appellant failed to provide the gist of a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and because appellant's petition for relief did not fall within the pale of Apprendi relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that sentenced him to 90 years in prison for first degree murder accomplished by beating and burning the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder for the beating and burning of a man. The court agreed with him that his statements and fingerprinting should have been suppressed as the fruits of an unlawful arrest without probable cause, as anonymous calls to the police did not provide indicia of reliability. The court also agreed that defendant was unlawfully seized, as seizures were reasonable only if supported by probable cause. Seizure was not permissible as an expedition for evidence. Defendant also maintained that his trial counsel was ineffective. As the court held that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence, defendant did not suffer prejudice due to the totality of counsel's performance. Finally, the court agreed that the imposed enhanced sentence was unconstitutional and an abuse of the trial court's discretion. Under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. V and the notice and jury trial guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. VI, any fact, other than prior conviction, that increased the maximum penalty had to be charged in the indictment, submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed in part and vacated in part. The trial court's denial of defendant's motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence was reversed, as he was unlawfully seized. The 90-year extended-term sentence was vacated, as the aggravating circumstances that resulted in the enhanced sentence should have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Defendant decided to break into a house and force a young girl inside to have sex with him. He cut the screen door and entered the house. He went into the girl's room, held a knife on her, and fondled her. Defendant pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. A psychologist for defendant testified defendant was insane when he committed the acts. A psychologist testifying for the State said defendant was not insane and that he knew that he was engaging in criminal conduct. The jury was instructed regarding the verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity and guilty but mentally ill. Defendant was found guilty on all charges. He appealed. The court affirmed. Even though the trial court gave a jury instruction based on an invalidated insanity statute, defendant was not prejudiced. The jury did not even find that defendant was mentally ill, which the Illinois Supreme Court had previously declared was a less severe form of insanity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) convicted defendant of attempted predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/8--4(a), 12--14.1(a)(1) (1998), attempted aggravated criminal sexual abuse, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/8--4(a), 12--16(c)(1)(i) (1998), and two counts of attempted indecent solicitation of a child. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from his communications with an undercover sheriff's detective who met defendant on the internet. The detective represented that he was 12 years old, and the defendant indicated that he was 34. Defendant sent pictures via e-mail of men engaged in sexual conduct to the undercover detective and arranged to meet him. The trial court found the defendant guilty of attempted predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, attempted criminal sexual abuse, and two counts of attempted indecent solicitation of a child. On appeal, the court held that: 1) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress oral and written statements to investigators, 2) the state proved defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of attempted predatory criminal sexual assault; (3) the state proved defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of attempted indecent solicitation of a child; (4) the trial court erred in considering in sentencing a prior conviction that had since been vacated; and (5) the concurrent sentence of 365 days' imprisonment for indecent solicitation of a child was beyond the maximum allowed for a misdemeanor charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed, his sentence was vacated in part, and the cause was remanded for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which followed a retrial by jury, convicting him of murder and sentencing him to an enhanced term of natural life in prison under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 1005-8-1(a)(1)(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon retrial, defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. He appealed his conviction and the sentence imposed for his crime. The court affirmed the conviction but reversed the sentence. The trial court did not err in concluding that defendant had not been denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. Most of the three and one-half year delay in conducting the second trial was chargeable to defendant. Even where the State requested continuances, defendant did not object to the continuances and often was requesting one as well. The trial court also did not err in certifying the State's expert witness who testified about luminol testing and interpretation and in denying certification to defendant's witness who was to testify about luminol testing and blood splatter evidence. The trial court did err in precluding a defense witness from testifying that she had seen defendant participate in several fights, but that error was harmless. However, the provision under which defendant was sentenced was constitutionally infirm; a judge, rather than a jury, decided a fact issue that involved, in essence, an element of the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Murder conviction, entered on retrial after reversal of first conviction, was affirmed, but life sentence was reversed. Sentencing enhancement factor, whether the crime was especially brutal or heinous, was essentially, an element of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for rehearing of a decision by the Appellate Court of Illinois, First District, First Division, which had dismissed defendant's petition challenging the propriety of his sentence to consecutive terms of 50 years for first degree murder and terms of 25, 15, and 10 years for attempted murder counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot at two men, missing one, but hitting the other in the shoulder. Defendant challenged his convictions under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1 et seq. (West 1998), arguing that the trial court erred in making his sentences consecutive rather than concurrent and that the law under which he was sentenced was rendered unconstitutional by the Apprendi decision. Defendant argued that the injured man's injury was not sufficiently grave to qualify as &quot;severe bodily injury&quot; under the law governing the imposition of concurrent and consecutive sentences. In denying defendant's petition for rehearing, the court held that the Apprendi rule should not be retroactively applied under the act. Defendant's sentence was not unconstitutional at the time that it was entered, regardless of whether it would have been unconstitutional if entered subsequently. Since the Apprendi rule did not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review, the court chose not to address the merits of defendant's claim as to the sentence for the attempted murder of the injured man.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petition for rehearing was denied, and 10-year consecutive sentence for attempted murder of the uninjured man was modified to run concurrently with the other sentences. Defendant's sentence for the attempted murder of the injured man was not unconstitutional at the time it was entered, regardless of whether it would have been unconstitutional if entered subsequently.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged the Circuit Court of Cook County's (Illinois) suppression of defendant's written statement to police, in prosecution of him for two counts of obstructing justice by leaving Illinois, and for concealing himself with the intention of obstructing the prosecution of others for attempted murder, aggravated battery, and hate crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Witnesses alleged that defendant saw white assailants beat black children. Police brought defendant to their station where he made an oral statement before his attorney arrived. After his attorney's arrival, of which defendant was unaware, he made a written statement. Later defendant was charged with obstructing justice and concealing himself as a witness. Alleging that he had been in police custody at the time of his statements, defendant sought to suppress them. The trial court found that defendant had not been under arrest then, and did not suppress the oral, but did suppress the written statement. Upon the state's interlocutory appeal, the court reversed suppression and remanded. Simply because defendant was at the police station did not mean that he was in custody, nor was he accused or a suspect. Defendant did not have reasonable cause to suspect the possibility of subsequent prosecution from a direct answer, thus the right against self-incrimination did not apply. Even had police violated 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/103-4 (1998) by not letting defendant consult with his attorney, that would have been but one factor in deciding whether to suppress the statement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Suppression was reversed and the case remanded. Evidence sufficiently showed that defendant was not in police custody at station. Defendant did not have reasonable cause to suspect the possibility of subsequent prosecution from a direct answer, thus his right against self-incrimination did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, criminal defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder, aggravated criminal sexual assault, and other crimes. On appeal, the court found that the trial court had improperly imposed an extended sentence, and remanded for re-sentencing as to that offense alone. On remand, the trial court sentenced defendant to 60 years in prison for first degree murder, and again ordered that defendant's 20-year sentence for aggravated criminal sexual assault would run consecutively to the murder sentence. Defendant appealed and argued that the sentencing statute, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 515-8-4(a) (West 1995), allowed for the imposition of an unconstitutional sentence, since the sentencing for his individual crimes would be impermissibly enhanced by allowing the sentences to be run consecutively. The court agreed and modified the sentences. Concurrent sentences had to be imposed so defendant's sentence would not be impermissibly enhanced. Also, the court ordered that the mittimus be corrected by deleting reference to a separate crime that the State conceded it could not prove.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois). He was found guilty of possession of a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen vehicle with identifying number removed, concealing the identity of a vehicle and possession of a removed manufacturer's identification number plate. Thereafter, the trial court sentenced defendant to a term of 20 years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued he was denied a fair trial where the jury heard inadmissible hearsay and a prior consistent statement which improperly bolstered the credibility of the State's key witness. Since counsel did not object when the officers testified as to what the witness said and defendant did not include the issue in his post-trial motion, the court declined to address the issue. Inasmuch as the prosecutor drew reasonable inferences in his closing from the testimony, the court did not abuse its discretion in overruling defense counsel's objections. The trial court did not exhibit bias. Defendant was sentenced as a Class X offender because he had 10 prior felony convictions. Mandatory Class X offender sentencing provision under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3(c)(8) (West 1997) was not unconstitutional. The trial court properly sentenced defendant according to the law as it then existed. If defendant's Class X sentences were unconstitutional, the sentencing would still have been within the trial court's jurisdiction. Thus, it would have been a voidable order, which was not subject to collateral attack.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction and sentence affirmed. If defendant's Class X sentences were unconstitutional, the sentencing would still have been within the trial court's jurisdiction. Thus, it would have been a voidable order, which was not subject to collateral attack. Defendant failed to preserve issues by not contemporaneously objecting at trial and including the issues in a written post-trial motion. Judicial bias was never deemed harmless, but none found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was found guilty of first degree murder and armed robbery, challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentencing him to concurrent prison terms of natural life for murder and 50 years for armed robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a security guard in a building where jewelry was sold. Victim was a tenant in the building. After victim let defendant into his store one evening, defendant wrapped duct tape around victim's wrists, ankles, and head. He then took several bags of merchandise. Defendant then slit victim's throat and shot victim in the neck. The jury convicted defendant of both armed robbery and murder. Due to the heinous nature of the crimes, the trial court sentenced defendant to a term of natural life imprisonment for the offense of murder and an extended term sentence of 50 years for the offense of armed robbery. Upon review, the convictions were affirmed, but sentences were vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing. The court concluded 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(b) (West 1992) was unconstitutional because it allowed a trial judge to impose a sentence beyond the 20 to 60 year statutory range for first degree murder by finding the existence of certain facts which had not been submitted to the jury for proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Because defendant's natural life sentence was vacated, his enhanced 50 year sentence for armed robbery could not stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convictions were affirmed; however, sentences were vacated and case was remanded for resentencing. Defendant's natural life sentence for first degree murder was invalid, as statute permitting trial court to exceed 60 year maximum sentence upon a judicial finding of fact that murder was particularly heinous was unconstitutional. Extended term sentence for armed robbery could not stand after murder sentenced had been vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denying his motion to dismiss the State's petition to declare him a sexually violent person, contending that the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 207/1 (West Supp. 2000), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court pointed out that it had previously been determined that people committed under the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act (Act) were not similarly situated to those committed under the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code, 405 Ill.

Stat. 205/1.01 et seq. (West 1998), since the criteria needed to qualify under the Act were far more specific than those needed to qualify as a sexually dangerous person. Since proceedings under the Act were civil, there was no basis for a double jeopardy or ex post facto challenge. The court found that the term &quot;mental disorder&quot; had sufficient clarity to identify who could have fallen within the Act. The term &quot;substantially probable&quot; was not so vague that persons of common intelligence necessarily had to guess at either its meaning or its application. Appellant did not have a right to a jury trial under the Act, since proceedings under the Act were civil.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified questions in the negative, holding that the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act was not an ex post facto law and did not violate equal protection, the double jeopardy prohibition, procedural or substantive due process, or free speech.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed and remanded, agreeing with respondent that &sect; 30(c), as it was applied to him, denied him due process by barring him from presenting the testimony of an examining expert to contradict the testimony offered by the state's examining expert.

Defendant appealed, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to request a separate jury verdict form for the offense of felony murder, the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences for first degree murder and armed robbery under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(a), (b), and trial court abuse of discretion in imposing its sentences without properly considering all mitigating circumstances. The court vacated in part ordering concurrent sentences for defendant, holding that the imposition of consecutive sentences for the convictions of first degree murder and armed robbery was unconstitutional because the jury did not decide the question of whether the severe bodily injury to the decedent occurred during the commission of the armed robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed the order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which affirmed defendant agency's finding that plaintiff owed taxes on interest income it earned in 1989 and 1990, under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a Texas corporation that sold wholesale home decorative accessories nationwide. During 1989 and 1990, plaintiff invested in short-term securities. Plaintiff reported the interest income as allocable only to Texas. Defendant, the state revenue department, then sought to tax all the interest income as apportionable. Defendant found that plaintiff owed the taxes, and the trial court affirmed that decision. Plaintiff appealed, challenging the tax under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The appellate court reversed and remanded the decisions of defendant and the trial court. The type of funds at issue was excess cash that was not used or part of plaintiff's working capital needs. The apportionment of all the income violated the Commerce Clause and due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order and the decision of defendant agency were reversed and remanded. Plaintiff prevailed regarding its position that only the portion of the interest income that was available for use as working capital was to be apportioned, and therefore the parties would be bound by their previous stipulation as to the total amounts of income to be apportioned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment entered by the Circuit Court of Johnson County (Illinois), under the armed violence statute, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5-33A-2 (West 1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed violence, under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5-33A-2 (West 1998) for using the butt of a shotgun to beat the victim. Because Public Act 88-680 (Ill. 1994) was later found to violate Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d), the law in effect prior to that unconstitutional amendment controlled. Defendant had been sentenced under an unconstitutional statute requiring a minimum sentence of 10 years, and the prior statute did not give a minimum sentence. When no minimum sentence was listed, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1(a)(3) required that the minimum sentence for a class X felony would have been 6 years; thus, defendant was entitled to be resentenced. Defendant's attorney was not ineffective for failing to submit a jury instruction to allow a conviction of armed violence with a bludgeon, rather than a shotgun, because the manner in which the weapon was used did not matter under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5-33A-2 (West 1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed, because fact that he used shotgun as bludgeon did not entitle him to jury instruction on armed violence with bludgeon, rather than shotgun. His sentence was reversed, because statute he was sentenced under was later deemed unconstitutional; thus prior statute controlled, and minimum sentence under prior statute was less than under unconstitutional statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and armed robbery in connection with the killing of defendant's lover. Defendant claimed he killed the victim when the victim attacked defendant after defendant paid the victim for sex. Defendant took jewelry and money from the victim to make the crime look like a robbery. Defendant appealed his convictions, arguing the State failed to prove the necessary concurrence between the use of force and taking of the victim's property, and other errors. The court held that to constitute armed robbery, the use or threat of force must be part of a series of events constituting a single incident. The court held there was a sufficient time interval between the murder and the taking of the victim's property that the acts were not a series of events constituting a single incident. Prior to taking the victim's property, the defendant took a long bath and went to a grocery store to buy garbage bags. There was no evidence defendant determined before or close to the time of the murder that he would remove the victim's property. The only evidence of defendant's motivation for taking the property was that he wanted to conceal his involvement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's armed robbery conviction and remanded for resentencing, because there was a sufficient time interval between the murder and the taking of the victim's property that the acts were not a series of events constituting a single incident.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) decision denying her petition for postconviction relief, claiming retroactive application of the Apprendi decision entitled her to a jury trial on the facts that constituted the extended terms of her maximum sentence for first-degree murder, pursuant to 730 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of burglary, home invasion, robbery, and first-degree murder. She was given an extended term of imprisonment for the murder. Subsequent to the United States Supreme Court ruling in Apprendi, appellant sought post-conviction relief. The court reversed in part, finding Apprendi applied to an appeal of a timely-filed (but denied) post-conviction petition. Applying an exception to the general rule of non-retroactive application of a rule, the court found that Apprendi should be applied retroactively because it required the observance of procedures implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. The trial court found the murder was accompanied by exceptionally brutal behavior (having been committed against a victim at least 60 years of age). The extended terms increased the statutory maximum sentence and thus should have been treated as an element of the offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's first degree murder trial, one of the alternative theories of first degree murder in the jury instructions was felony murder based on burglary as defined in 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/19-1 (West 1992). The burglary statute did not apply to burglary of a home. It was clear that the victim was killed in his home; thus, defendant could not have been guilty of that crime. However, the jury was not instructed that &quot;burglary&quot; could not have applied to a home. The charge to the jury was factually insufficient, not legally insufficient. The felony murder charge would have been proper if supported by the evidence. The other first degree murder theories were supported by the evidence. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, and it was unclear which theory of first degree murder the jury used for the conviction. A reversal of the general verdict was not required, because the evidence was sufficient to support one of the alternative means of committing the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Because no substantial rights of defendant were affected by the alleged error, the evidence was not closely balanced, and defendant did not object to the errors at trial, the error was waived by defendant.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 5/8-4(c)(3), 19-3 (West 1998), and the trial court found two prior Class 2 felony convictions made defendant ineligible for a three to seven year Class 2 sentence, but made him eligible for a Class X sentence from six to 30 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was charged with attempted residential burglary, a Class 2 felony, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/8-4(c)(3), 19-3 (West 1998). Defendant was arrested after he was observed crawling into a window at an apartment building and then backing out, and was convicted at a bench trial. Although a Class 2 felony provided for a possible prison sentence from three to seven years, defendant's criminal history included two prior Class 2 felony convictions, thereby making him ineligible for a Class 2 sentence. The prior convictions required defendant receive a Class X prison sentence from six to 30 years. The trial court imposed a 25-year sentence. Defendant appealed and argued his due process rights and jury trial guarantees had been violated because the prior convictions were neither alleged in the indictment, submitted to a jury, nor proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The court affirmed. The court held defendant's sentence was permissibly enhanced as defendant's prior convictions had been established through procedures satisfying due process and jury trial guarantees. The court also held defendant's sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment sentencing criminal defendant to 25 years in prison affirmed even though defendant's sentence was increased based on prior convictions not charged in the indictment for the current offense, not submitted to the jury, and not proved beyond a reasonable doubt because statute which permitted that enhancement violated neither defendant's due process rights nor jury trial guarantees, and sentence imposed was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, who was taking such drugs, argued that the act that amended that statute, 1996 Ill. Laws 3775, was unconstitutional because it violated the single subject rule of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d). He therefore argued that the original version of the statute, which did require such a determination should have been in effect at the time of his trial. The breadth of the act's title, and the fact that several amendments and additions were included, did not automatically amount to a violation of the single subject rule. Since all 19 sections of 1996 Ill. Laws 3775 related to the criminal justice system, the fact that the subject matters of the sections were different was not material.</SPAN></P>

The accident occurred in Illinois. Appellant was transported to a hospital in Missouri, where blood and urine tests indicated that appellant was intoxicated. Appellant filed a motion to suppress, arguing that the Illinois police had no authority to &quot;demand&quot; blood from him while he lay unconscious in a hospital in Missouri. The trial court denied the motion. The court affirmed. Under 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-501.1, the police had authority to travel to an adjoining state to complete an investigation and to request that the suspect submit to blood, breath, or urine tests. Further, an Illinois officer could &quot;demand&quot; blood from an unconscious suspect in a hospital in Illinois. The court held that there was no reason the provision in 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-501.1(b), allowing testing of an unconscious suspect, would not include such testing in another state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a day of drinking, defendant assaulted his girlfriend by grabbing her wrist and bending her fingers backward before punching her in the face and the back of the head.

The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. Defendant's extended sentence for domestic battery was improper and was to be vacated because domestic battery was not the most serious felony defendant was convicted of. Defendant's convictions for aggravated battery and domestic battery resulted from the same act and not three separate acts; therefore, extended sentencing was only available for aggravated battery and the portion of defendant's sentences on counts that exceeded the non-extended statutory minimum were to be vacated also. Defendant's $ 200 fine was to be vacated because it was improperly imposed by the court clerk and should have been imposed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants made interlocutory appeal of order granting preliminary injunction preventing continuing site preparation required for the construction of a retail store on a parcel of land. Defendants argued, among others, that plaintiffs were unlikely to have succeeded on the merits of the action, as due process and statutory law did not create a right of cross-examination at a zoning hearing. The court held that the hearing requirements of 65 Ill. Comp. Stats. 5/11-13-1.1, 11-13-5, 11-13-14, and 11-15.1-3 included a right to cross-examination. The court held that a public hearing meant the right to appear and give evidence and also the right to hear and examine the witnesses whose testimony was presented by opposing parties. The court held a legislative distinction between large and small municipalities did not indicate that adjoining landowners in smaller municipalities were entitled to fewer procedural safeguards. The court held that cross-examination could have been limited, but the reviewing court should have considered the extent to which cross-examination was required for a full and true disclosure of the facts with due regard to the circumstances of each particular case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were convicted in separate trials of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and aggravated battery with a firearm. In a consolidated appeal, appellants alleged that gang-related testimony was hearsay, irrelevant and prejudicial, and imposition of consecutive sentences was unconstitutional. Affirming the judgment, the court held not all of the gang evidence that appellants challenged was hearsay, as some was from personal knowledge and other was from expert testimony. Further, even if any error was made in admitting hearsay evidence, the remaining evidence was overwhelming and the appellants were not prejudiced by its admission. One of the appellants' sentence was reversed as the court held unconstitutional the sentencing guideline requiring consecutive sentences, holding if consecutive sentences were to be imposed pursuant to a factual finding that severe bodily injury occurred, then severe bodily injury had to be submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants convictions affirmed; gang evidence appellants claimed was hearsay, was not as it came from personal knowledge of the witness or the witness was an expert.

One appellants' sentence was reversed, as sentencing guideline imposing sentence was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a mentally disabled adult, appealed a judgment of the Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois), which ordered visitation between appellant and appellee, who was appellant's estranged father, pursuant to the Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/101 et seq. (1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the circuit court could have ordered visitation between appellant, a mentally disabled adult, and appellee, the estranged father of appellant, under the Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act (Act), 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/101 et seq. (1998). Appellant, who was an adult at the time the visitation order was entered, had Down's syndrome. The circuit court ordered visitation between appellee and appellant, even though appellant expressed his desire not to see appellee. Appellant contended that the visitation provisions of the Act were applicable only to minor children and that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter an order of visitation as to an adult disabled person. Appellant also contended it was unconstitutional to order visitation over the objections of an adult disabled person. The court concluded that the circuit court, acting under the Act, did not have authority to enter an order of visitation with respect to a disabled adult; thus, the order requiring visitation was void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. As a result, the court did not reach the constitutional issues raised in the appeal.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs were located adjacent to residential property and within business districts that were not zoned for adult businesses. Defendant county sought an injunction against plaintiffs. The circuit court permanently restrained and enjoined plaintiffs from using their properties as adult businesses. The appellate court, on its own motion, struck all of the footnotes in plaintiffs' briefs because the footnotes were not used sparingly, as required by Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 341(a), 177 Ill. 2d. R. 341(a). The appellate court held that plaintiffs violated Du Page County, Illinois, Zoning Ordinance &sect; 37-4.16-2 because plaintiffs were within 500 feet of residential property. Furthermore, the appellate court held that the adult businesses conducted by plaintiffs did not constitute nonconforming uses because the uses were not lawful at their inception. Finally, the appellate court held that because there was no intent to convey a particularized message, activities conducted by plaintiffs' employees did not constitute expression protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) convicting him of violating an order of protection and sentencing him to an extended term of four years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by indictment with one count of residential burglary and one count of violating an order of protection. The latter charge alleged that on July 17, 1998, defendant violated an order of protection by entering the residence of his former wife. The State acknowledged that defendant had never received a copy of the order of protection. The trial court found defendant guilty of violating the order of protection, but not guilty of burglary. On appeal, defendant argued the State failed to prove he had acquired knowledge of the contents of the order of protection prior to his arrest on July 17. Conviction was affirmed. The applicable statute did not require that defendant acquire knowledge of the entire contents of the order of protection prior to being charged with the offense. Rather, the statute required only that defendant have specific knowledge of the provisions of the order that he was charged with violating. Based on his communications with his ex-wife and with a police office the week preceding his July 17 arrest, defendant knew that an order of protection had been entered against him and that he was not permitted in his ex-wife's residence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly violated a provision of the order of protection, even though defendant had not been served with an actual copy of the order. Statutory penalties prescribed within the offense of violating an order of protection were not unconstitutionally vague and, therefore, defendant's sentence was valid.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court first held that the regulations which banned utilities and their affiliated alternative retail electric suppliers from joint advertising and marketing passed muster under the intermediate level of scrutiny for the regulation of commercial speech. Second, the regulations were entirely in compliance with the intent of the Customer Choice Law, which was to give respondent the authority to oversee the restructuring of the Illinois electric marketplace and to ensure a competitive retail market for the provision of electric service.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted in an Illinois trial court of second-degree murder and aggravated battery enhanced for armed violence, appealed the armed violence portion of his conviction and sentence, arguing that second-degree murder conviction negated intent element and that sentence imposed thereon violated several Illinois Constitution provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an incident in which several victims were shot, defendant was convicted of second-degree murder, not appealed, and armed violence, an enhanced offense based on the predicate offense of aggravated battery. The court noted that only a specific intent offense could have qualified as a predicate. Although defendant's murderous intent was mitigated, his battery against a different person, not closely involved in the altercation, involved specific intent. The mitigated intent in the one was not imputed to the other incident, so his conviction stood. Because defendant was sentenced to the mandatory minimum term for armed violence pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/33-A-3 (West 1996), which statute had since been invalidated for violating the single subject clause of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8, remand for resentencing under the predecessor statute, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/33-A-3 (West 1994), was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, because where two different victims were involved, he was not entitled to have mitigated mental state from one imputed to the other, but reversed and remanded in part for resentencing because the mandatory minimum sentence was imposed under a statute that had been invalidated.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 5/5-32001 et seq. (West 1996), to portions of a special assessment for water service extension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After respondent county arranged for extension of water mains to properties where wells had been contaminated, it prepared a special assessment against benefited landowners, pursuant to the Illinois Local Improvements Act, 55 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-32001 et seq. (West 1996). Petitioner landowners sought relief from a portion of the assessment on the grounds that respondent included in costs of the improvement the salaries of respondent's employees who spent time on arranging for the assessment. Looking to the plain language of the statute, the court found explicit authorization for inclusion of salaries of county committee for local improvements employees and no reference whatsoever to county employees. This was not an unconstitutional public expenditure for private benefit, because increased property values would have increased tax revenues. The effect of this ruling on counties' future willingness to approve special assessments was a matter for the legislature to deal with.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, because plain language of the statute made it clear that salaries of respondent's employees who prepared the assessment were not recoverable as part of it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff dealership sued defendants automobile importer and distributor for breach of agreement and an alleged Motor Vehicle Franchise Act, 815 Ill.

Defendants compounded the problem by willfully and wantonly using a shortage allocation method that breached the parties' agreement. The breach caused fewer vehicles to be sent to plaintiff to sell. Plaintiff claimed resulting lost profits. Plaintiff recovered on both claims. It accepted statutory damages, which the trial court then trebled pursuant to the Act. Defendants appealed. The court affirmed. The court held the verdict for plaintiff was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, a release argument was waived, proximate cause was proven, plaintiff was entitled to recover under the Act, the trial court properly denied certain jury instructions, and the jury's verdicts on both claims were not irreconcilably inconsistent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of eight counts of drug possession with intent to distribute and sought review of his convictions and fine. The court affirmed the convictions but reversed imposition of the fine. The search warrant was personal to the appellant. It was based on appellant's activities rather than his presence at the apartment. There was evidence connecting appellant to previous drug dealing. A reliable informant said appellant sold him narcotics and he helped appellant put narcotics in a car. Based on the warrant's description of the place to be searched and also naming appellant and things to be seized, the search warrant contained language indicating that it was intended to be personal in nature. However, an imposed fine, which was to be based on the street value of drugs seized, was improper where the state failed to present testimony concerning the going price of the drugs and appellant should have been afforded an opportunity to cross examine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were involved in a car accident with defendant. Defendant raised the affirmative defense that third-party defendant was severally liable, under 1995 Ill. Laws 284, 299-300. Under that proportionate liability law, defendant could only be held liable for her proportion of fault. Subsequently, the Illinois Supreme Court struck down the proportionate liability law, and less than four months later, defendant filed her third party complaint. Third party defendant argued that the statute of limitations to file the complaint began to run when the underlying action was filed, and thus it had expired six days after the Illinois Supreme Court's decision. The court compared the change in the law to an amendment to a statute of limitations and found defendant should have been given a reasonable time in which to file her third party complaint, and six days was not a reasonable time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of defendant's third party complaint, holding that defendant was entitled to a reasonable time after the change in the law in order to file her action.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, maintaining the Act was unconstitutional and provided for improper delegation of legislative authority to an administrative body, and defendant abused its discretion in dissolving the college based on flawed evidence. They also sought conveyance of the college real estate. The trial court dismissed, finding the Act was not unconstitutionally vague, did not infringe on plaintiffs' rights, and did not violate due process The appellate court affirmed, holding plaintiffs did not rebut the presumption of proper legislative delegation of authority and constitutionality of the Act. The Act was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant's determination based on the college's lack of sufficient population and tax base was not abuse of discretion.

(West 1998), did away with requirement that plaintiff had to allege and prove actual or constructive notice on part of landowner before liability would have attached.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was roller skating at defendant's skating rink. After taking a short break, she resumed skating and decided to skate backwards for a while. While doing so, and after some turns around the rink, she slipped and fell, fracturing her elbow. She noticed water near where she fell, which she testified was in the area where another skater had nearly fallen earlier. There was a skylight immediately above the area where her fall occurred. She did not see the puddle she fell in prior to the time of her fall. She was also unable to say how long the puddle was present. She sued defendant for negligence. Defendant moved for summary judgment, which was granted. She appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the Roller Skating Rink Safety Act, 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. 72/1 et seq.

Liability could not have been imposed on owner for presence of substance no one had knowledge of immediately prior to an accident. In absence of any evidence tending to show constructive notice, a directed verdict for defendant was proper.</SPAN></P>

IV, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated assault with a firearm in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-4.2 (West 1998). Reviewing the record, the court held that it was more than adequate to support a jury in finding beyond reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly caused the complainant great bodily harm when he repeatedly shot at and wounded him. Defendant's sentence was well within the statutory range for his offense, and it was presumed that the trial court had considered all proper factors in mitigation. Finally, defendant argued that the original uncodified statute criminalizing his conduct violated the single subject rule of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8. The court held that the constitution only required that various provisions logically related to a single overarching subject, not that they relate to each other. In the case they all related to crime, and that was sufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed conviction, because the evidence supported finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, sentence was well within statutory range, and statute did not violate single subject rule because every part of the original legislation related to crime.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 10-8-515 (1998), finding the ordinance unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee man stood on a Chicago street corner yelling &quot;blows,&quot; a common term for heroin. He was charged with soliciting unlawful business, Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 10-8-515 (1998). Trial court granted his motion to dismiss, finding the ordinance unconstitutionally vague. The court reversed in part. Most complaints in the multiple cases appealed were not defective. However, one was found defective where the only conduct alleged was yelling the word &quot;blows.&quot; The remaining appellees were also charged with other crimes, such as prostitution, drug sales, or sale of false identification. Defining the street meaning of &quot;blows&quot; informed a defendant of the type of unlawful business of which he was accused. Trial court erred in striking down the ordinance simply because defendants could have been charged under other criminal laws. The ordinance did not improperly prohibit constitutionally protected speech. The word &quot;soliciting&quot; and phrase &quot;unlawful business&quot; were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed in part because the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague and most complaints were not defective; reversed in part because some complaints were defective where they failed to define the conduct that constituted unlawful business.</SPAN></P>

The one with the baseball bat was seven months pregnant. Defendant managed to obtain the bat and used it to beat the victim. He was convicted and appealed. The court held it was not error to introduce the fact that the one woman was pregnant because defendant alleged self-defense and the woman's condition rebutted the claim she was a threat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual assault, home invasion, and armed robbery. Defendant filed a postconviction petition alleging that Public Act 80-1099, 1977 Ill. Laws 3264, was unconstitutional because it violated the single subject rule of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d). The office of the State Appellate Defender (OSAD) was appointed to represent defendant in his appeal. The OSAD filed a motion to withdraw because there were no meritorious issues presented for review. All the sections of Public Act 80-1099 concerned criminal law or the administration of criminal justice and were naturally and logically connected to the criminal justice system, a subject that was found to be not overly broad. Thus, the court agreed with OSAD that the instant appeal presented no meritorious issues for review. Therefore, the court allowed the motion of OSAD to withdraw as counsel, and affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

During the revocation proceeding, the respondent informed the court that he was taking antidepressant medication, but the juvenile court did not hold a fitness hearing. On appeal, the respondent argued that Public Act of Dec. 31, ch. 89, 1996 Ill. Laws 689, which modified the requirements governing a fitness hearing based on an accused's use of psychotropic medication, violated the single subject rule, and therefore the probation revocation proceedings should be remanded for a fitness hearing. The court affirmed. The court held the act was constitutional, and under the act, a respondent receiving psychotropic drugs was not presumed to be unfit solely by virtue of the receipt of those drugs. Because respondent made no additional showing that he was unfit at the time of his revocation proceedings, the trial court's revocation of the respondent's probation was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; the challenged statute stated that a respondent receiving psychotropic drugs was not presumed to be unfit solely by virtue of the receipt of those drugs, and because respondent made no additional showing that he was unfit at the time of his revocation proceedings, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying respondent a fitness hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions and sentences for home invasion and murder (three defendants for first degree murder, and one defendant for felony murder). The court reversed and remanded two defendants' convictions and sentences for home invasion and first degree murder, because their confessions should have been suppressed as fruits of their illegal arrests. In other words, there were no intervening circumstances that broke the causal connection between their illegal arrests and their confessions. The incriminating statement of each of these two defendants could not serve as an intervening circumstance as to the other, because each one was unaware of the other's statement implicating him. The third defendant's felony murder conviction and sentence were affirmed, but his home invasion conviction and sentence were vacated, because home invasion was a lesser-included offense of felony murder, and therefore, the included offense of home invasion would not support a separate conviction and sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought a class action seeking a declaration that defendant's imposition of an airport departure tax on plaintiffs' ground transportation services violated 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 14505(2) (Supp. II). Plaintiffs and defendant filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs and against defendant as to class A, those operators providing service to destinations outside Illinois, and against plaintiffs and in favor of defendant as to class B, operators providing prearranged service to destinations within Illinois. The court affirmed the order in part and reversed in part. The court held the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment against class B and in favor of defendant because &sect; 14505 did not apply to the type of travel represented by class B. Additionally, the court held that the trial court erred in finding that the levying of the airport departure tax against class A violated &sect; 14505(2) because the court found that Congress did not intend to preempt the levying of the airport departure tax even upon the transportation services provided by class A.</SPAN></P>

He also argued that admission of the weight tickets was improper because the weigh scale was not tested properly so there was insufficient evidence of accuracy. The court affirmed, finding the department did not exceed its authority in exempting law enforcement scales from commercial weighing requirements, that neither the regulations nor their application were arbitrary or capricious, and the State laid a proper foundation for admitting the weight tickets.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 5/13-214.3. The lower court granted first defendant's summary judgment motion, but denied second defendant's motion to dismiss, holding that there was a jury question as to whether plaintiffs' claims were filed within a reasonable period after the amendment to the statute of repose. On appeal, the court agreed that since the alleged malpractice in both cases occurred more than six years earlier, the six-year statute of repose barred both actions. The court also found that 21 months after the amendment's effective date in which plaintiffs had to file before termination of the repose period was a reasonable period of time. Summary judgment for first defendant was affirmed, and denial of second defendant's motion to dismiss complaint was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court found the trial court had jurisdiction pursuant to statute and appellant was present; therefore, the order entered by the trial court was voidable, not void, and was not subject to collateral attack. However, the court reversed, finding trial court's decision denying appellant's petition was against the manifest weight of evidence. Appellant made a prima facie case that she was not harmful to herself or others and that she could take care of her basic personal needs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stabbed her husband during an argument. At trial, evidence was presented that defendant told the police that her husband threw a lamp at her and touched her with a vacuum cleaner but she did not believe he was trying to hurt her. At trial, defendant testified that during the argument, her husband had been choking her and had hit her with the lamp and the vacuum cleaner causing bruises. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that the jury instruction for second-degree murder violated her U.S. Const. amend. XIV rights by requiring the defendant to bear the burden of proving a mitigating factor. The court held that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-2 (West 1996), the second-degree murder statute, was constitutional and the instruction accurately stated the law. The instruction also adequately stated the proof necessary for the state to negate a claim of self-defense. Since the instruction was proper, defendant's counsel was not ineffective to propose it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed because jury instruction on second-degree murder did not unconstitutionally shift the burden to defendant to prove a mitigating factor, and defendant's counsel was not ineffective in proposing the instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant petitioned plaintiff's planning commission to rezone five properties so it could build a subdivision by a neighboring golf course.

Defendant's petition was not approved. Plaintiff then acquired the golf course. Defendant was not complaining of the denial of its petition per se, but of plaintiff's theft of its opportunity. The Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/1-101 et seq., was not intended to immunize governments from misuse of their powers. Defendant also established a quasi-contract claim, since plaintiff was obligated to process the application in good faith and according to its usual procedures, in exchange for the application fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate sued defendant doctors in federal court for medical negligence. After dismissal of that action for failure to meet heightened pleading requirements for medical negligence cases, plaintiff refiled his action in state court. The court held that res judicata would bar plaintiff's state court action if the prior dismissal were held to be a disposition on the merits. It was the settled rule in Illinois that a dismissal of a medical negligence action for failure to file an appropriate physician's report with other pleadings was a judgment on the merits, not a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. Since the federal court decision was on the merits, in an action between the same parties on the same cause of action, res judicata barred the state court action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed dismissal, because the prior federal dismissal for failure to meet heightened pleading requirements was an adjudication on the merits, so a subsequent state court suit was barred by res judicata.</SPAN></P>

Respondent also contended that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a substantial probability existed that he would commit another sexually violent act in the future. The court found that despite the disparities in the expert testimonies given at respondent's trial, there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that respondent was a sexually violent person.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was a Spanish-speaking Mexican American who was charged with bringing, with intent to deliver, more that 900 grams of cocaine into the state in violation of 720 Ill.

Defendant filed a pro se post-conviction petition alleging violations of his constitutional rights. The trial court dismissed all claims but one. The court reversed and remanded, accepting defendant's argument that the trial court erred in entering partial dismissals of the post-conviction petition. The court held that the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-l et seq. (West 1998), did not allow a trial court to determine that some aspects of the defendant's petition stated the gist of a meritorious claim and others did not. The trial court should have examined the petition as a whole and determined whether, as a whole, the petition stated the gist of a meritorious claim. Because it did, the trial court had to have the whole petition proceed to the second stage and had to appoint counsel for defendant.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued appellee state failed to prove guilt, admitting audiotape was error, ruling appellant's mother could not impeach audiotape was error, the court invaded the jury's role by answering a jury question, the 34-year sentence was excessive compared to his prior 28-year sentence, and failure to credit time served was error. The state proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, admissibility of the audiotape allegedly violating the eavesdropping statute relied on the statute in effect at recording time, the court properly excluded the mother's testimony, appellant waived issues about the first trial transcript, failure to prove prejudice prevented an ineffective counsel claim, and the sentence was not excessive since it was within the statutory range. The court erred in failing to credit time served, and remanded to determine credit entitlement, calculate time credit, and enter a corrected mittimus.

Reading witness transcript to jury after their requested to see it was not an abuse of discretion. 60-year sentence was not an abuse of discretion where appellant had violated probation prior to crime and probation officer evaluated his performance as poor. Appellant should have been credited for 56 days of confinement served in Georgia.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction and sentence affirmed because witness's transcribed statement was properly admitted, sentence was within the trial court's discretion and was proper pursuant to statute. However, appellant was entitled to credit for 56 days of confinement in Georgia.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 305/19(o) (West 1993), finding ex-employee's carpel tunnel syndrome was not work related and his claim not compensable, after insurer determined otherwise and paid claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An electrician employed by plaintiff for about six years suffered an accident. Three years later he was diagnosed with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome requiring surgery, which was paid by his group health insurance. He was then told plaintiff had no further work for him. He resigned and later filed a claim for compensation under the Workers' Compensation Act for on-the-job injury. Plaintiff, believing the claim non-compensable, asked the insurer to deny the claim but the insurer paid the employee, despite the three-year time lapse. Plaintiff petitioned the Industrial Commission (Commission) under 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. 305/19(o) to have the claim purged from the records. The petition was denied. The denial was affirmed by both the circuit court and the court,, as the Commission's denial was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, as the employment could well have been a causative factor, and the insurer's payment did not violate the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order was affirmed, as it was evident the industrial commission could have found evidence that some act or phase of employment was a causative factor in employee's injury, so it could not be said it was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found the language used in 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/108A--3(a)(2)(c) did not require the consenting party to be identified in any particular way. The court held the use of an alias in an application for an eavesdrop authorization did not undermine the authorization's validity. The order authorizing the eavesdrop recordings was valid. A police officer overhearing a conversation with one party's consent and without the aid of a listening device was not eavesdropping, regardless of the officer's intent to surreptitiously overhear the conversation. The use of the information obtained from listening to the conversations in the original application for an eavesdrop authorization did not render the later order invalid. Noting the prophylactic nature of Miranda warnings the court found that because defendant's statements were otherwise voluntary, fruit of the statements, the cocaine seized from defendant's bedroom was admissible. The evidence against defendant was overwhelming.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a riverboat gambling license applicant, appealed an order from the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) granting defendant Illinois Gaming Board and intervening defendants a transfer of venue from one county to another.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from defendant Illinois Gaming Board's (board) denial of a riverboat gambling license in Lake County. The court found venue was proper only in Cook County because that was where the board's principal office was located and the transaction forming the basis of the plaintiff's complaint, the enactment of an allegedly unconstitutional statute, did not occur in Lake County. Preparatory or preliminary acts alone were insufficient to invoke transactional venue. Plaintiff's unilateral efforts to qualify for an owner's license were insufficient to invoke transactional venue. The fact that plaintiff unilaterally expended substantial amounts of money and made significant efforts to qualify for a license was a risk that any entity wishing to obtain an owner's license would have to take. Plaintiff's completion and mailing of its application in Lake County were simply preparatory acts. The court held Lake County was not a proper venue for plaintiff's cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Transfer of case to Cook County was proper because that is where defendant Illinois Gaming Board regularly functioned and where its principal office was located.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challenged the order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) upholding his dismissal by defendant school district as a tenured school teacher based on a juvenile court finding that he sexually abused his child under 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/2-3(2)(iii) (West 1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff teacher sued defendants, school district, county, education board, and hearing officer, for dismissal by defendant school district as a tenured teacher based on a court finding of sexual abuse under 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/2-3(2)(iii) (West 1996). Plaintiff challenged whether the amended 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/10-21.9(c) (West 1998): (1) required dismissal of a contractual service teacher based on a case where appeals were not exhausted; (2) impaired vested rights flowing from plaintiff's contract, or (3) impaired contract rights, violating federal and state constitutions. The appellate court noted the legislature intended a finding to be sufficient for teacher dismissal under 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/10-21.9(e) (West 1998), suggesting a mere finding justified termination under &sect; 5/10-21.9(c). The amendment did not change or impair the contractual relationship because terms and conditions were subject to statutory provisions and regulations, and defendant was always subject to dismissal for cause. Defendant had no vested right under the earlier statute existing when his contractual service began, but was subject to the amended statute that allowed dismissal for abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed because (1) sexual abuse finding justified termination of plaintiff teacher under school statutes, (2) statutory amendment did not impair contract because terms and conditions were subject to statutory provisions and regulations, and defendant was always subject to dismissal for cause, and (3) no vested right existed under earlier statute, making plaintiff teacher subject to amended statute allowing dismissal for abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-1009A violated several provisions of the Illinois Constitution. The court concluded that the appropriate level of scrutiny was the rational relation test, because the arbitration fee did not involve a fundamental right. The fee did not violate the uniformity clause, Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, because imposing the fee upon all litigants was reasonably related to the benefit of reducing the court's backlog, even for those litigants who did not use the arbitration system. The court rejected plaintiff's argument that the fee violated the free access clause, Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 12, and the due process clause, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, because the appellate court deferred to the legislature's judgment in determining that the mandatory arbitration system operated to expedite cases within the court system. Because the mandatory arbitration system functioned as part of the unified court system, the legislature had authority to impose a fee on any, or all, litigants in the circuit courts to fund the system.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners' constitutional rights to equal protection and due process were not violated, because the home study and court-ordered investigation of petitioners were rationally related to the legitimate goal of finding a stable adoptive home for the child and the foster-parent preference of the Adoption Act was rationally related to provided the child a stable home. The Juvenile Court Act did not create a liberty interest that applied to petitioners as grandparents; thus there was no due process violation, and biological mother's consent to petitioners' adoption was invalid under the Adoption Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The circuit court properly granted the adoption petition in favor of the foster parents and against petitioner grandparents after weighing evidence, statutory factors, and testimony to determine it was in the child's best interest to be adopted by the foster parents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order of the Circuit Court for the 9th Judicial Circuit, Warren County (Illinois), granting summary judgment to appellees in an action to recover cleanup costs under the Illinois Environmental Protection Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees had accumulated a large number of automobile tires on their property after giving permission to appellee tire repair business owner to deposit them in a ravine. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (agency) removed the tires and sought to recover the cost from appellees. The lower court granted summary judgment to appellees, holding that 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/55.3(g) (West 1998) of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act (Act), authorizing the recovery of costs, could not be applied retroactively because the tires were dumped before the statute was amended, and that appellees were not the owners or operators of the tires under the Act. The court disagreed, holding that the agency was only seeking recovery for the maintenance of the tires on the property in a manner prohibited by the Act. Retroactive application was irrelevant. There was also a factual issue as to appellees' ownership, because they had testified that the tires were being used for erosion control.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court reversed lower court's judgment, because statute was not being applied retroactively to dumping occurring before statute made it illegal; it was being applied to current illegal maintenance of tires on property. Appellees' testimony to using tires for erosion control raised issue of material fact of ownership, precluding summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County, Illinois, contending consecutive terms of imprisonment were improper because he was not admonished he was eligible for them; and the statute modifying the requirements for hearings based on defendant's use of psychotropic medication violated the single subject rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to theft and admitted the allegations which revoked probation in eight other cases. The trial court sentenced the defendant to four consecutive three-year terms of imprisonment. Since his notice of appeal was filed more than 30 days after the decision on the motion, the court did not have jurisdiction to hear the first eight cases. The court held defendant could not challenge the admonishments he received before he pled guilty to theft in the ninth case. When he filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, he never addressed the issue of the trial court's failure to properly admonish him. Any issue not raised in the motion to withdraw the plea of guilty was waived on appeal. The court held that the subject of public safety was not so broad that it violated the single subject rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appeal of revocation of probation in first eight cases dismissed for lack of jurisdiction due to untimely filing of notice.

Defendant subsequently filed a third-party complaint for contribution against a third-party defendant.

The plaintiff claimed that she refiled her action only once. The court held that, regardless of whether the refiling was tantamount to a second refiling for purposes of &sect; 13-217, it was an untimely filing, as she filed it beyond the statutory one-year period from the date of her voluntary dismissal of her first action. As to the cross-appeal, the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the matter because the notice of cross-appeal was filed more than 10 days from the notice of plaintiff's appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant social worker, employed by defendant social services entity, introduced this information, which she was aware was untrue, to school board officials and other persons.

The court upheld the verdict for plaintiff, rejecting defendants' arguments, but reversed as to punitive damages. The court found that, because plaintiff had shown actual malice, he was entitled to have the jury consider his request for punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant department of revenue assessed plaintiff company with underpayment of its 1986 Illinois income taxes. Plaintiff protested the assessment, but defendant rejected the challenge. Plaintiff filed a verified complaint in the circuit court, which affirmed. On appeal, plaintiff asserted that its 1986 income had been overstated by more than $ 1,500,000 because its 1984 loss, which was deductible for federal purposes, was not deductible for Illinois purposes. The court affirmed, holding that the plain language of Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/101 (1992) sought to achieve a fair representation of the extent of a person's business activity in Illinois; it did not address the calculation of the taxpayer's tax liability. Further, while Ill. Rev. Stat.  ch. 120, para. 2-207 (1987) allowed a loss to be taken as a carryover or carryback deduction as in the federal code, that section had no retroactive application. Finally, there was no due process violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm and received consecutive sentences of 27 and nine years. On appeal the court found the trial court erred in allowing testimony regarding identification of defendant from a photo lineup because there was no occurrence sufficiently startling to produce a spontaneous and unreflecting statement. However, the court's erroneous admission of the evidence was harmless. The court held the State proved defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of aggravated battery with a firearm because the victim suffered an injury when his arm was grazed by a bullet fired by defendant. Defendant should not have been subject to the truth-in-sentencing provisions of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6--3 (West 1996) because the act which amended the statute was unconstitutional. Finally, the court erred in imposing consecutive sentences because defendant did not inflict severe bodily harm on the battery victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of many crimes, including attempted first-degree murder of a police officer, sexual assault, aggravated battery, and stolen automobile possession.

Stat. 5/9-1(b)(1) making a victim's being a police officer an aggravating factor, defendant was sentenced to 160 years in prison on the murder attempt. During appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court invalidated the statute of which the sentencing formulas for attempt were a part, on grounds that it violated the single-subject provision of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. A replacement statute was not effective until after the date of offense. The court instructed the trial court to resentence defendant to the maximum term allowable under constitutional statutes in effect at the time of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery, attempted murder, and attempted murder of a police officer. The charges grew out of the defendant's bank robbery, the ensuing shoot-out with police, and defendant's flight from police. The conviction for the attempted murder of a police officer was affirmed, because the evidence was sufficient to show that the defendant knew or should have known that the person he shot was a police officer. The new sentencing range set forth by Ill. Pub. L. No. 88-680 was void because it violated the single subject rule of the Illinois constitution. Therefore, defendant was to be re-sentenced under the old standard. The trial court properly exercised its discretion in sentencing defendant for the attempted murders of civilians. Defendant was convicted of only one triggering offense requiring a determination of consecutive sentences, and so the sentences for all the other offenses were to be served concurrently.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction for attempted murder of police officer affirmed; defendant should have known victim was a policeman.

Defendant filed her cross-appeal notice on April 2, 1999. Plaintiff appealed. The court affirmed. The court held plaintiff failed to refile her cause of action within one-year after she voluntarily dismissed her original cause of action on July 30, 1992. The court also dismissed defendant's cross-appeal. The court held it lacked jurisdiction because defendant failed to file her notice of appeal within ten days as required by the Illinois Supreme Court rules.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction but remanded for resentencing because the state's highest court had ruled that 1989 Ill. Laws 203, under which the defendant was sentenced, violated Ill. Const. art.

The court reversed, finding that the language of the statute at issue was clear and unequivocal and that the provisions permitted direct disclosure of blood-alcohol test results by medical personnel to law enforcement agencies, and such a disclosure could be made without violating any statutory physician-patient privilege.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An operating partnership purchased certain assets which gave rise to replacement tax investment credits for years 1988 and 1989. However, the operating partnership was not entitled to an investment credit because it had no replacement tax liability after subtracting distributable income including that distributed to plaintiff, nonresident partner, which was subject to the state replacement tax. Plaintiff claimed it was entitled to the operating partnership's tax investment credit, but the revenue department disagreed. The court reversed finding that under the vested rights approach, the amendment to 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/201(e)(West 1996) applied to plaintiff who was allowed the tax credit to avoid an otherwise unreasonable result. The assertion of personal jurisdiction related to plaintiff's minimum contacts with the state and the state had afforded protection and benefits to plaintiff, thus, subjecting plaintiff to the replacement tax violated neither the due process or commerce clauses. Plaintiff's physical presence was not required.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court vacated sentences for attempted murder and aggravated discharge of a firearm and remanded for resentence, as the act under which defendant was sentenced had been declared unconstitutional. The court otherwise affirmed, finding that: under King doctrine, defendant's convictions for armed violence and unlawful possession of a weapon were based on separate acts; State fulfilled requisite formalities for proving defendant's prior conviction, as in addition to having the court take judicial notice of the record, the state offered additional evidence, through officer testimony, to substantiate defendant was the person named in the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of unlawful possession of a controlled substance and appealed the denial of his motion to quash his arrest. The court held that evidence obtained in a search incident to an arrest based on a mistaken belief that defendant was the subject of the arrest warrant, when made in good faith, was not excluded. In this case, the arrest involving mistaken identity was deemed valid because the mistake was made in good faith. Sufficient probability, not certainty, was the touchstone of reasonableness under U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court believed that the information the officer received when he called the dispatcher was a sufficient basis to take defendant to police headquarters to determine whether the warrant was for him. Given the circumstances of this case, the court could not say that the trial court's determination that the officer acted in reasonable good faith was manifestly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was charged with first-degree murder following the death of his infant son. One witness testified the child did not have any injuries a few days before he died. Thereafter, defendant said the child fell and struck a table. A day later, defendant told the witness, the child had an asthma attack. The child soon died. A medical examiner testified the child had 22 separate external injuries and suffered from shaken-baby syndrome. The trial court convicted defendant and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed the conviction, but vacated the sentence. The court held a rational trier of fact could infer from the numerous, severe and fatal injuries that defendant knew his actions created a strong probability he would cause death or great bodily harm to the child. The court, however, held defendant had to be resentenced because his sentence violated the Illinois Constitution's single-subject rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the trial court affirmed but sentence of natural life without parole vacated and case remanded because evidence showed criminal defendant's violent shaking of infant son caused infant son's death, but sentencing violated the Illinois Constitution's single-subject rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged judgment of the Circuit Court of 21st Judicial Circuit, Kankakee County, Illinois, holding that defendant's closed circuit television appearance at guilty plea hearing did not violate his right to be physically present under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, U.S. Const. amend. VI, XIV, and 177 Ill. 2d R. 402.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a guilty plea via closed circuit television. Defendant's motion to withdraw the guilty plea was denied. Defendant argued that the use of closed circuit television in guilty plea hearings violated his constitutional right to be present during the proceedings under U.S. Const. amend. VI, XIV and under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court held that because of the critical significance of a guilty plea to defendant, a televised guilty plea was not permitted. Thus, defendant should have been physically present at the time he entered his guilty plea. The court held that 177 Ill. 2d R. 402 did not permit defendant's appearance by closed circuit television. Although defendant failed either to object to the use of closed circuit television at the plea hearing or in a written posttrial motion, the issue was plain error. Therefore, he should have been permitted to withdraw his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and remanded; defendant's guilty plea was a critical proceeding. The trial court violated defendant's constitutional right to be present at all critical proceedings when it entered defendant's guilty plea via closed circuit television. Therefore, defendant should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principals alleged that they were unlawfully removed from their tenured positions following, and due to, the enactment of 1985 Ill. Laws 1418, which was later declared unconstitutional. The State asserted that the principals failed to state a cause of action against the State. The State argued that it never entered into a contract with the principals. The court held that there was no contract, and a term in the statute did not create contractual rights. Therefore, the court had no jurisdiction to hear this matter in accordance with 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 505/8.</SPAN></P>
