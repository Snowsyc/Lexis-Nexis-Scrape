But, the record evidence failed to support defendant's claim. First, under the right for any reason principle, the affidavits presented lacked the type of materiality required to support a new trial, as they did not show the witnesses's trial testimony to have been the purest fabrication. Further, defendant failed to act diligently in presenting the affidavits he alleged supported his motion. Second, the affidavits supporting the statements recounting a co-defendant's alleged admissions were not sufficiently material. Third, defendant's lack of diligence supported rejection of the statements that the co-defendant disposed of a handgun following the murder. Fourth, at least one original witness never recanted his in-court identification of defendant as the shooter. Finally, defendant failed to present the facts necessary to warrant a hearing on his motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a Chatham County jury convicted defendant of malice murder and related offenses, he appealed, contending that: (1) the trial court erred in admitting the decedent's statements under the necessity exception to the hearsay rule; (2) the trial court erred by giving the pattern jury instruction on prior difficulties evidence; (3) he received ineffective assistance of counsel; and (4) the trial court erred in sentencing him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon finding sufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions, the court then found that no error resulted from the admission of the victim's out-of-court statements because: (1) she was deceased and therefore could not offer the testimony in person; and (2) said statements constituted some of the most probative and revealing evidence offered at trial regarding defendant's threats towards the victim and the highly abusive nature of their relationship. Second, the pattern jury instruction was proper under settled Georgia case law. Finally, defendant failed to make the requisite showing with respect to each of his numerous allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. While counsel might have been deficient by failing to contend that, when the State offered evidence of defendant's prior convictions for impeachment purposes, the probative value of admitting the convictions did not substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect, defendant failed to show prejudice. Further, it was irrelevant for purposes of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-11-131(b) to state what felony formed the basis of the prior conviction, and specification of the underlying felony in the indictment was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed. But, upon the State's concession, his sentence to life in prison without parole was vacated, and the matter was remanded for the trial court to impose a legally authorized sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an outdoor sign company, appealed the judgment of the trial court (Georgia), which granted defendant city's cross-motion for summary judgment and denied the company's motion for partial summary judgment. The company brought suit challenging the city's sign ordinance, after its applications to erect outdoor signs were rejected by the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company contended that the city's entire sign ordinance was unconstitutional. The company had submitted three applications to construct billboard signs, each 672 square feet in area and 70 feet in height. The city rejected each application because the sign ordinance in place at the time limited off-premises signs to a maximum area of 128 square feet and 12 feet in height, and because the applications were incomplete. Subsequently, the city enacted a moratorium on the issuance of sign permits for the purpose of drafting a new sign ordinance. The company allegedly attempted to submit applications for similarly-sized signs during the moratorium, and the city did not accept any of the applications for processing. The court concluded that the trial court made no error when it held that the company had standing to contest only those provisions of the sign ordinance that had caused injury to it since Georgia had a more relaxed standard to a facial attack on an ordinance. As such, the court determined that the trial court should not have addressed the company's constitutional arguments concerning other provisions of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated, in part, the trial court's rulings with regard to addressing the company's constitutional arguments concerning provisions of the ordinance that it lacked standing to challenge. Otherwise, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff customers appealed two orders of the trial court (Georgia), which upheld the constitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-9-67.1 by excising &sect; 24-9-67.1(f) and that excluded the testimony of their two experts. Plaintiffs brought a personal injury suit against defendants, a retailer and a manufacturer, alleging that they incurred injuries while using a floor covering product made by the manufacturer and sold by the retailer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly before the case went to trial, &sect; 24-9-67.1 was enacted, which governed the qualification of expert witnesses and the admissibility of expert testimony. Based on the new statute, and after a mistrial, the defense renewed their motion to exclude the testimony of the two experts, in response to which the customers mounted attacks on the constitutionality of &sect; 24-9-67.1. The court held that the customers had standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 24-9-67.1 but that the trial court did not err in rejecting their equal protection challenge since they failed to show that they were similarly situated to a defendant in a criminal action as parties to civil cases are not similarly situated to those engaged in criminal prosecutions. The court also agreed that the trial court did not err by finding that &sect; 24-9-67.1 did not violate due process but that the trial court was mistaken in declaring &sect; 24-9-67.1(f)&nbsp;unconstitutional as a violation of the principle of separation of powers. However, that conclusion did not require reversal of the judgment since the trial court upheld the statute's constitutionality overall.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated, in part, the trial court's order finding a subsection of the statute unconstitutional on a particular ground. Otherwise, the court affirmed the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In deciding the instant case, the Court of Appeals relied upon the instant court's precedent, which stated that a sentence of life without parole was authorized only in cases in which the State first sought the death penalty. Upon a review of the facts and relevant law, this reliance was proper. Specifically, under the facts involving defendant herein, the State did not supply any notice under the Uniform Rules of the Superior Courts that it intended to seek the death penalty, nor did the trial court make a finding of any aggravating circumstance under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-30. As a result, pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-32.1, the trial court was not authorized to sentence defendant to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Moreover, O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-32.1 applied even after the Georgia General Assembly's 1999 inclusion of an additional potential penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus against a warden. A Georgia habeas court set aside the inmate's sentence of life without parole under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-7(b)(2) but denied relief as to his convictions. The inmate and the warden each appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that a felony murder charge with the underlying felony of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon had been vacated by operation of law, and no conviction on that charge had been entered. Accordingly, unlike the case relied upon by the habeas court, the trial court had not used the prior felony conviction both to support a possession conviction and to enhance the inmate's sentence. Thus, the inmate was properly sentenced to life without parole. The habeas court properly found that the inmate's prior West Virginia conviction for second-degree murder was a &quot;serious violent felony&quot; under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-6.1. Although the language of the West Virginia indictment, charging that the inmate did &quot;feloniously, willfully, maliciously, deliberately and unlawfully slay, kill and murder&quot; the victim, did not directly track the language of Georgia's murder statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-1, it was sufficient to show that the same offense, if committed in Georgia, would be a serious violent felony. Finally, the inmate's ineffective counsel claim was procedurally defaulted under O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-14-48(d), and the inmate had not shown cause and prejudice to excuse the default.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the habeas court's ruling setting aside the sentence of life without parole. It affirmed the ruling denying the inmate relief on the remaining grounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Dawson Superior Court (Georgia) convicted defendant of driving under the influence of drugs to the extent that he was a less safe driver under O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-391(a)(2), speeding, following too closely, failure to maintain lane, and failure to signal. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer saw defendant's car weaving outside of its lane, closely following other vehicles, and driving in excess of 80 miles per hour. He pulled defendant over and saw that defendant's speech was slow, that he was unsteady on his feet, and that his eyes were bloodshot and glassy. After defendant performed poorly on field sobriety tests, the officer arrested him. An alcohol test was negative, but a urine test was positive for cocaine, marijuana, and six different prescription drugs. The court held that this evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. Next, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. When a defendant was arrested based on probable cause and the State had complied with the implied consent requirements of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-55, he could not complain that drug and alcohol testing violated the search and seizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment or the Georgia Constitution because the statute allowed for the warrantless compelled testing of bodily fluids based on the existence of probable cause, but without proof of the existence of exigent circumstances. Finally, an instruction on criminal intent, viewed in its entirety, was proper.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner alleged on appeal that the trial court erred in rejecting her claim that the forfeiture amounted to an excessive fine. The instant court disagreed, as the owner's willful blindness to her father's activities on the property in light of her knowledge of his past use of the property made her culpable. Second, although the father was subject to punishment under the criminal code for manufacturing marijuana, the owner was not subject to any punishment for permitting the property to be used criminally, other than by the instant action. Thus, the harshness of the forfeiture was not grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense on which it was based or to the owner's own culpability. Further, the evidence supported the trial court's rejection of her innocent-owner defense, as her serial conveyances of the property by way of gift deeds and of her lack of control over the property supported a finding that she held the property for her father, the person whose conduct gave rise to the forfeiture. Finally, as the forfeiture was not made under the power of eminent domain, but was nevertheless lawful, no Takings Clause issue was presented.</SPAN></P>

Appellant brought the declaratory suit against appellee, the Georgia Department of Corrections and others, asserting that &sect; 42-1-15 caused a constitutional taking of his property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant moved from his parents' home, got married in 2003, and purchased a home with his wife. In 2004, appellant became the half owner and day-to-day operator of a restaurant. It was uncontroverted that neither the home nor the business were located within 1,000 feet of any child care facility, church, school, or other area where minors congregated at the time they were acquired by appellant. However, child care facilities located themselves within 1,000 feet of both appellant's home and his business and his probation officer demanded that he quit the premises of his business and remove himself from his home upon penalty of arrest and revocation of his probation. The court held that &sect; 42-1-15(a) was unconstitutional with regard to appellant's home as it permitted the regulatory taking of his property without just and adequate compensation. However, the court found no such taking occurred with regard to appellant's business as there was no prohibition on appellant owning an interest in such business and no necessity was shown that he had to physically work in the restaurant as opposed to being able to hire others and do accounting work from his home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, in part, the trial court's ruling denying appellant's request for declaratory relief in regard to the residency restriction and affirmed, in part, the trial court's ruling denying his request for declaratory relief in regard to the business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment was granted based on a ruling that under O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-9-67.1(c), appellants' expert was not qualified to give an opinion in the case. The supreme court affirmed. The doctor, an otolaryngologist, was alleged to have deviated from the standard of care regarding the informed consent given to the patient for a  sleep apnea procedure. Under the statute, the expert had to be qualified in that specialty area by having actively practiced in the area with sufficient frequency to establish an appropriate level of knowledge in performing the procedure. Although the expert's affidavit stated that he performed surgeries, he did not state that he had performed the sleep apnea procedure or that he had obtained informed consents for similar surgeries. His statement that he was familiar with the standard of conduct required in similar cases was insufficient to satisfy the statute's requirements. The argument that &sect; 24-9-67.1 affected appellants' substantive rights and was unconstitutionally applied to their case as the patient's injuries arose before the effective date of the statute was rejected. The statute was procedural in nature and was properly applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari to defendants, two physicians, a university, and a health corporation, to challenge the judgment of the Court of Appeals (Georgia), which affirmed a trial court decision concluding that plaintiff patient's medical malpractice suit based on misdiagnosis was not barred by the statute of limitations and statute of repose since additional or significantly increased symptoms of the same misdiagnosed disease were presented.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1984, the patient was born with a rare heart defect. At the age of two months, he underwent surgery wherein he received blood transfusions. The two physicians treated the patient and, although he displayed signs of pediatric AIDS, neither of the physicians ever arrived at that diagnosis and attributed the symptoms to the heart condition. In 2001, the patient was finally tested for HIV and diagnosed with AIDS. His condition was the result of the blood transfusions he received as an infant. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendants on all claims where the alleged negligent or wrongful act or omission occurred more than five years before the date on which the action was brought but denied summary judgment on all medical malpractice claims where the injury occurred within two years of the date the action was filed and the negligent or wrongful act or omission that caused the injury occurred within five years of the date the action was filed. The court found error, concluding that the lower courts' holdings adopted a variant of the previously rejected continuing treatment doctrine and presented a reinterpretation of the term injury set forth in O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-3-71(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court. The court recognized the harsh result of its decision, which barred the patient's suit, but noted that it was for the Georgia Legislature, not the court, to make any change.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the trial court (Georgia), which denied his motion to suppress the evidence found at his residence and denied his motion to bar imposition of the death penalty or a life sentence without parole because the indictment did not allege the statutory aggravating circumstances. Defendant had pled guilty to four counts of murder and 18 related crimes. The State gave notice of its intent to seek the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Armed with an arrest warrant but without a search warrant, a probation officer, accompanied by several law enforcement officers, searched defendant's apartment for approximately 46 minutes. The court determined that the search was unlawful insofar as it exceeded a plain view search incident to an attempted arrest of defendant in his apartment. The court noted that the State failed to show any exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless search. Further, despite a probationer's rights under the Fourth Amendment being limited, defendant was in no way on notice that he would be subject to any warrantless searches of his residence. However, considering O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-8-38(a), the arrest of defendant was lawful. The court further held that under Georgia law, statutory aggravating circumstances were sentencing factors rather than elements of death eligible murder, therefore, no error occurred by not including such factors in the indictment. Lastly, the court agreed with the trial court's decision upholding the constitutionality of the amended criminal discovery procedures set forth in O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-16-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order, in part, with regard to the denial of defendant's motion to suppress and remanded the case to the trial court regarding the motion to suppress only.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two appeals, appellant warden challenged the grant of habeas corpus relief to appellee inmate by the Monroe Superior Court (Georgia), which resulted in the inmate's conviction for aggravated child molestation being reduced to a misdemeanor. In the second appeal, the inmate challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Douglas County (Georgia), which denied his motion for release on bail during the pendency of the warden's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with the habeas court's ruling that the inmate's sentence of 10 years in prison for having consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl when he was only 17 constituted cruel and unusual punishment in light of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-4 (2006), which substituted misdemeanor punishment for his conduct in place of the felony conviction of 10 years in prison with no possibility of probation or parole. The court acknowledged the 2006 amendment represented a shift in the Georgia General Assembly's view of the gravity of oral sex between two willing teenage participants and relieved such teenage offenders from registering as a sex offender. However, the court did find the habeas court erred in convicting the inmate for the misdemeanor crime, which did not exist when the conduct in question occurred. As such, the case required remand in order for the inmate's conviction and sentence to be reversed and for his discharge from custody. The court upheld the denial of a motion for release on bail, as O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-6-1(g) prohibited bail on appeal for persons convicted of aggravated child molestation and, therefore, the inmate was not entitled to bail pending the warden's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the habeas court ruling that the inmate's sentence was cruel and unusual punishment was affirmed in part and the case was remanded to the habeas court with direction to reverse the inmate's conviction and sentence and to discharge him from custody. The denial of the inmate's motion for release on bail was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's application for interlocutory appeal from the ruling of a trial court (Georgia), upholding the constitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-4-60, which required any person convicted of a felony and incarcerated in a State correctional facility to provide a sample for DNA analysis to determine the identification characteristics specific to the person. Defendant was indicted on charges of rape and statutory rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2005, while defendant was incarcerated in the State prison system for a felony drug conviction, a DNA sample was collected from him pursuant to &sect; 24-4-60(b). The profile resulting from the DNA analysis was filed in the DNA database and was matched to DNA gathered from an underage female who had reported a sexual assault in June 2002. After a fresh sample of defendant's DNA was obtained by search warrant and typed, the report reflected that the DNA gathered from the 2002 victim originated from either defendant or his identical twin. The State then indicted defendant on the charges, which gave rise to his motions to suppress evidence and quash the indictment based on constitutional challenges to &sect; 24-4-60. Defendant contended primarily that &sect; 24-4-60 denied him equal protection of the law because it required DNA samples only from convicted felons, thereby treating such persons differently than persons convicted of misdemeanors who were incarcerated. The court found no validity to defendant's argument and held that &sect; 24-4-60 rationally related to the legitimate State interest it was intended to promote and did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling of the trial court requiring defendant to provide the DNA sample.</SPAN></P>

A Georgia trial court dismissed the case based on forum non conveniens under O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-10-31.1(a). The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consultant was living in Georgia when the company hired him. After he began managing property in Louisiana, he moved to that state to be in close proximity to it, though at the time the lawsuit was filed, he continued to own a home in Georgia. The court held that &sect; 9-10-31.1(a) did not violate Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; IV, para. I. It did not automatically divest a superior court of its jurisdiction; rather, it provided directive regarding the proper venue of a given case only after the superior court exercised initial jurisdiction over the case and had exercised its discretion to determine whether the action would be more properly heard in a forum outside the state. Next, the trial court did not err in finding that Louisiana was a more convenient forum. The relative ease of access to sources of proof favored Louisiana; the witnesses could more easily be compelled to testify there; any premises to be viewed were in Louisiana; the company would not be inconvenienced by traveling to Louisiana, while the consultant would be inconvenienced by traveling to Georgia; a Georgia court would have difficulty in administering the case; and Georgia's interest in the matter was insignificant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Georgia trial court held that two county provisions, challenged by appellees, a lessor and its lessee, were unconstitutionally vague in that they contained insufficient objective standards and guidelines to satisfy due process, and gave appellants, the county, its board of commissioners (board), and its chief building officer, absolute and uncontrolled discretion to decide what uses required a special use permit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county, its board, and its chief building officer (officer) alleged on appeal that since the instant action was not a First Amendment case, the lessor and the lessees could not attack the constitutionality of the ordinances for facial vagueness, but rather were required to make an &quot;as applied&quot; challenge, for which exhaustion of administrative remedies was necessary. The instant court first held that the lessor and the lessee had not preserved an &quot;as applied&quot; challenge because they have never made a constitutional attack on the ordinances as applied to their property. Moreover, the trial court did not rule on that issue. Further, the lessor and the lessee did not seek a special use permit, and a building permit was not actually granted or denied. Therefore, regardless of whether they would otherwise have had a viable facial challenge to the ordinances, they lacked standing to make a constitutional attack thereon. Any remaining enumerations of error were held to be moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on charges for which the death penalty was sought.

Defendant sought interim review, arguing that O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-16-4 violated her rights against self-incrimination and to effective assistance of counsel under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With regard to assistance of counsel, the court stated that under the statute, counsel could freely investigate for mitigating evidence, knowing that the identity of any potentially harmful witness resulting from that investigation need only be produced to the State in reciprocal discovery should the defense decide to call that witness at the presentence hearing. As for the requirement that a defendant disclose the witnesses she planned to call at the presentence hearing, such a provision was proper where, as here, the disclosure was limited to the nonprivileged statements related to the subject matter of the testimony of the witnesses and in a defendant's custody, possession, or control, and conditioned upon the defendant's intent to call the witnesses at the presentence hearing. Next, disclosure of the list of witnesses a defendant intended to call was personal to the defendant and thus could implicate the self-incrimination privilege. A trial court could exercise its discretion to specify the time, place, and manner of making the discovery and to enter such orders as seemed just under the circumstances under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-16-6 when such self-incrimination concerns arose.</SPAN></P>

Appellees, an individual and his outdoor sign company, had challenged the denial of their applications to place outdoor signs on two sites.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sign ordinance at issue prohibited off-premise signs in commercially-zoned areas. Appellees challenged the ordinance, contending that the prohibition against off-premise signs in commercially-zoned areas was an unconstitutional violation of free speech. The trial court, after determining that several sections of the sign ordinance were unconstitutional, remanded the case to the board for reconsideration of appellees' applications. The court stated that its jurisdiction in the case was necessarily limited to determining whether the trial court correctly ruled that the ordinance violated the First Amendment. The court found that the ordinance defined a billboard very broadly, so as to include any sign which advertised services, merchandise, entertainment, or information and, likewise, had a very broad definition of a sign. The ordinance, by outright banning all signs and then allowing which ones will be permitted on a case-by-case basis violated the scope and structure requirements of the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's application for interim review of the indictment charging defendant with murder, felony murder, and concealment of a death. The State had given notice of its intent to seek the death penalty. The trial court had previously overruled defendant's demurrer to the felony murder count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Count two of defendant's indictment attempted to charge felony murder, but it included the phrase, intentionally and with malice aforethought, which should appear in a malice murder charge, not a felony murder charge. The State could have charged malice and felony murder in the alternative in the same count but did not. Since the charge against defendant mixed those elements rather than charged them in the alternative, the court held that the felony murder count required quashing. The court found that the fact that the indictment did not state that the victim was a human being was not a material defect and merely required correction. Further, the fact that it was possible that co-defendant committed the murder for the purpose of receiving money, rather than defendant, did not cause the notice of intent to seek the death penalty to be in error and the State merely had to re-notify defendant regarding the statutory aggravating circumstance using the language of O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-30(b)(4). The trial court also did not err by refusing to compel the District Attorney's testimony about his decisions to seek the death penalty as such as decision was within the prosecutor's discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's overruling a demurrer to the felony murder count of the indictment, directed the State to re-notify defendant as to the aggravating factor asserted against her as well as directed the State to add in the indictment that the murder victim was a human being. Otherwise, the court affirmed on all other issues raised.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff pedestrian brought a personal injury suit against defendant parking lot owners. She alleged that she had slipped and fallen on ice in the lot. A jury in a Georgia trial court returned a verdict in favor of defendants. The trial court denied plaintiff's motion for a new trial and denied defendants' request for attorney fees under O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-68, which it held to be unconstitutional. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 9-11-68 became effective while the parties' litigation was pending. The court held that the statute violated Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. X as a retrospective application of law that altered vested rights. The statute did not merely prescribe methods of enforcing rights and obligations, but affected the rights of parties by imposing an additional obligation to pay an opposing party's attorney fees when a final judgment did not meet a certain amount or was one of no liability. Next, the jury had asked the trial court whether plaintiff had said that she had slipped because of ice. Plaintiff's testimony was lengthy, and she had vacillated throughout as to the cause of her fall and the conditions on the ground. Thus, the trial court properly refused to parse plaintiff's testimony or to have the tape of her testimony played in its entirety to the jury. Finally, the trial court properly refused to give a proposed jury instruction as to an accumulation of naturally occurring ice. Both the charge requested and the charge given covered a proprietor's duty to exercise ordinary care, including the duty to inspect the premises for dangerous conditions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a doctor and others, were granted certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals (Georgia), which affirmed a trial court order denying appellants' motion to dismiss the medical malpractice suit filed by appellee patient. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-9.2 was preempted by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee had executed an authorization to release her medical records and filed the same contemporaneously with her complaint. Appellants had moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the authorization did not satisfy the requirements of &sect; 9-11-9.2 by failing to authorize their attorneys to communicate with appellee's treating physicians outside the presence of and without prior notification to her lawyer, even though the statute did not expressly provide that a plaintiff's requisite authorization must grant such ex parte discovery rights to the defendant. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, holding that &sect; 9-11-9.2 was preempted by HIPAA. The preemption issue had already been decided by the appellate court in a separate suit, but since the preemption question was an issue of first impression and certiorari had not been sought in that other suit, the court granted appellants' petition. The court upheld the ruling that HIPAA preempted &sect; 9-11-9.2 since &sect; 9-11-9.2 did not sufficiently comply with the HIPAA requirement of notice of the right to revoke and was less stringent than the requirements mandated by the federal law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, appellant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions, but the trial court found that sufficient evidence existed for a rational trier of fact to have found appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all the crimes for which he was convicted, particularly since appellant's contention that O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-395 only applied to officers on foot would have rendered the phrase &quot;pursuing police vehicle&quot; in the first sentence of &sect; 40-6-395 meaningless, with a court being prohibited from interpreting a statute in such a manner. However, the court determined that appellant's convictions required reversal since the trial court erred by failing to strike a specific juror for cause as that juror expressed a distinct bias against appellant by stating that he had pretty much formed an opinion already, that it seemed as if appellant was guilty, and that it was the defense's job to prove that appellant was not involved. The trial court completely failed to question the juror with regard to his ability to lay aside his prejudices and personal experiences and fairly and impartially decide the case on the evidence presented at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Decatur Superior Court (Georgia) convicted both defendants of multiple counts of violating O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-17-2, which prohibited the making of &quot;payday loans,&quot; which were defined as loans of $ 3,000 or less with illegal interest rates. Both defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants challenged the constitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-17-1 et seq., alleging that the trial court erred by rejecting their equal protection and vagueness challenges. The appeals court disagreed, instead agreeing with the State, that defendants were not similarly situated with the out-of-state banks designated in O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-17-2(a)(3). Both defendants, as in-state lenders, were subject to Georgia statutes regulating or restricting high interest rates on loans, whereas the out-of-state banks were not. In light of the protected status of out-of-state banks under federal law, the Georgia Legislature had a rational basis for creating a class based on those in-state payday lenders who were subject to state regulation. Thus, the classification bore an obvious and direct relation to the legitimate purposes set forth in O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-17-1(c) and (d). Further, the court found that the prohibition against payday loans, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-17-1 et seq., in whatever form transacted, was sufficiently definite to satisfy due process standards.</SPAN></P>

A Georgia trial court approved and adopted the special master's report, vesting title in the trustees and declaring the tax sale void. The bidder appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a review of the record, it was undisputed that the property at issue was exempt from taxes. But, the trustees never received notice of the tax sale. Moreover, no past or present member of the congregation ever lived at the address which the tax notices were sent, and the special master was authorized to so find. Thus, because the trustees were never given the required notice, their due process rights were violated by the tax sale and the deed to the bidder resulting from that unconstitutional sale was, therefore, void. Second, the exception to the tender requirement applied, as taxes were not due at the time the property was sold because of its tax-exempt status.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a citizen and taxpayer of a county, challenged the judgment of the trial court (Georgia), which dismissed appellant's petition for declaratory relief and denied his writs for mandamus and quo warranto. Appellant brought suit against defendants, the county commission, a mayor, and each individual commissioner, seeking primarily to hold a new election for mayor pro tempore for 2006. A commissioner cross-claimed for declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two elections held the same night, one commissioner received five yes votes and four no votes, and another commissioner received four yes votes and five no votes for the mayor pro tempore position. One commissioner abstained from each vote. Because the year 2006 had ended, the court agreed that all of appellant's claims, but for declaratory relief, were rendered moot. Since the mayor's method of counting votes remained, the court held that the declaratory judgment action survived and was not moot. The court held that the Consolidation Act, 1997 Ga. Laws 4690, 4691 and 1995 Ga. Laws 3648, 3650, &sect; 1, required that abstentions by commissioners not be counted as affirmative votes and that the rules of procedure to be followed by appellees provided that they not be counted as negative votes. In that regard, the rules were not inconsistent with the Consolidation Act. As a result, under the current law applicable to the county, abstentions by commissioners must not be counted as either affirmative or negative votes, therefore, appellant was not entitled to declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, in part, that portion of the judgment that dismissed the declaratory judgment action and remanded the case to the trial court for the entry of an order denying such relief to appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court properly denied a motion to suppress a tote bag on the ground that defendant lacked standing to seek suppression of it. Defendant had presented no admissible testimony as to whether he was aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-5-30(a). Next, defendant's custodial statements were not inadmissible under O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-50. It was not improper for police to encourage a suspect to help himself by telling the truth. Furthermore, regardless of whether defendant's warrantless arrest inside his home was illegal, the statements he made later outside the home during his custodial interrogation did not have to be suppressed on federal constitutional grounds. Next, after defendant elected to participate in the criminal discovery procedure under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-16-1 et seq., the statutes had been amended. Defendant's previous election to participate was binding upon him. The amended procedure was not unconstitutional. It imposed reciprocal discovery burdens upon the State, and any difference in the scope of mitigating evidence and the scope of nonstatutory aggravating evidence was too minimal to be of constitutional significance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction. But, the appeals court disagreed with his first contention that O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-10-20 was unconstitutionally vague under Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. I, as the statute gave him ample notice that the conduct of which he was accused was prohibited. The statute also provided sufficient objective standards to those who were charged with enforcing it. Defendant's act was criminal when he made his false statement, without regard to the result of that act. The fact that application of the statute's standards sometimes required an assessment of the surrounding circumstances to determine if the statute was violated did not render it unconstitutional. Second, the court rejected defendant's claim that under the rule of lenity, his crime could only be considered a misdemeanor, because the acts alleged met the definition of misdemeanor obstruction of a police officer, as O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 16-10-24 and 16-10-20 did not define the same offense, did not address the same criminal conduct, and there was no ambiguity created by different punishments being set forth for the same crime. Hence, the rule of lenity did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a review of the record, the instant court noted that neither the superior court nor any of the parties disputed that the superior court had at least concurrent jurisdiction over the cases at hand.

Second, while the superior court concluded that O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-11-28(b)(1) violated due process, equal protection, and separation of powers by failing to provide for judicial review of a prosecutor's decision to charge minors in superior court rather than juvenile court, the instant court previously rejected similar arguments, finding that O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-11-28(b)(1) was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed after he was convicted in a Georgia trial court on a charge of identity fraud. Defendant contended, inter alia, that the identity fraud statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-9-121, was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant misappropriated the victim's social security number and used it in obtaining a job. His wages were reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under the victim's name. The victim discovered the identify theft after the IRS informed him he owed back taxes. The supreme court affirmed. Contrary to defendant's assertion, he had in fact &quot;accessed a resource&quot; of the victim as required by &sect; 16-9-121. By using the victim's social security number to obtain a job, defendant accessed the victim's IRS account and thereby the United States Treasury (a &quot;resource&quot; for purposes of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-9-120(5)(F)) and caused harm to victim by attempting to make him responsible for defendant's tax debt. O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-9-121 explicitly prohibited the improper access of another's account at a financial institution. The plain language of O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 16-9-120 and 121 placed defendant on notice that his actions were illegal. The statute, therefore, was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. Finally, nothing in the federal law explicitly overrode O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-9-121, and as it did not conflict with the operation or enforcement of federal law, it was not preempted 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1324c.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An association of taxicab owners challenged an order of the trial court (Georgia) that granted a motion for summary judgment filed by a city in the association's action seeking damages and a declaration that certain sections of Atlanta, Ga., City Code ch. 162, under which the city regulated its taxicab industry, were unconstitutional. The association's members held certificates of public necessity and convenience (CPNC) issued under ch. 162.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court judgment in part. Establishment of an administrative procedure to enforce Atlanta, Ga., City Code ch. 162 was within the city's power under its charter and did not improperly divest the municipal court of jurisdiction. The one-year residency requirement for issuance of a CPNC in Atlanta, Ga., City Code &sect; 162-57(a)(3) violated the Commerce Clause. The association had standing to raise the challenge, and the city advanced no legitimate local purpose served by the residency requirement. Fines and penalties imposed on the association's members for their drivers' regulatory violations did not violate substantive due process by creating vicarious criminal liability. To the extent that City of Atlanta v. Fuller, 164 S.E.2d 364 (1968) held that the notice required by O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-33-5 could be accomplished by amending a complaint, it was overruled. The association, however, properly amended its complaint to add a claim that the city's notice procedures for violations violated due process after serving notice under &sect; 36-33-5. The appellate court did not rule on the sufficiency of the notice because the trial court had not ruled on that issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court judgment insofar as it ruled that the one-year residency requirement of Atlanta, Ga., City Code &sect; 162-57(a)(3) was constitutional and insofar as it dismissed the association's claim that the city's notice procedures violated procedural due process on the ground that the association gave improper ante-litem notice of the claim. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon charging defendant with violating O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-8-60(b), defendant attacked the statute and moved to dismiss the indictment on constitutional and federal preemption grounds. The Georgia trial court found that the statute was neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad and was not preempted by federal copyright law. Defendant was thus granted interlocutory review, and this matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-8-60(b), which criminalized the possession and distribution of sounds or images without a label in violation of copyright protection, was either (1) unconstitutionally vague or overbroad or (2) preempted by federal copyright law. The instant court said it was not. First, the statute plainly prohibited the sale, or possession for the purposes of sale, of an article that did not prominently display the name and address of the individual (or entity) who transferred the sounds to the article. Second, the statute did not impinge upon pure speech but, at most, regulated a combination of commercial conduct and speech. Third, the statute aimed to protect the public and entertainment industry from piracy and bootlegging, a legitimate governmental interest unrelated to free speech concerns. To the extent that it curtailed an artist's or transferor's desire to remain anonymous, its deterrent effect on legitimate expression was minimal. Finally, there was no federal preemption as the statute contained an extra element, specifically, labeling, which qualitatively distinguished it from federal copyright law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior and State Courts of Cobb County (Georgia) held that because the newly enacted asbestos claims statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 51-14-1 et seq., required plaintiffs to show that asbestos exposure substantially contributed to their medical condition, it unconstitutionally affected appellee employees' substantive rights by establishing a new element of their claim, which did not previously exist. Appellant employers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employers alleged that the lower courts erred by ruling that the O.C.G.A. &sect; 51-14-1 et seq. affected substantive rights and therefore could not be applied retrospectively to claims which accrued prior to its effective date. The instant court agreed. Also, the statute could not accurately be described as merely establishing a procedural threshold for a preliminary determination of causation. Because the legislature decided to include the requirement that asbestos plaintiffs produce evidence that exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing factor in the exposed persons' medical conditions and to place further restrictions on the form of such evidence, such demonstrated a clear intent to limit actionable asbestos claims to those situations in which a greater level of causation was shown. Hence, severance of this requirement would result in a statute that failed to correspond to the main legislative purpose, or give effect to that purpose, and the presence of a severability clause did not alter this result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner challenged the judgment entered against him.

Second, the court disagreed with the owner that O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-13-49(n) had to provide for notice to be printed in the county's legal organ in order to satisfy due process. Pretermitting the undisputed facts that the owner was served by certified mail and notice was published in the legal organ, publication in a newspaper of general circulation was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process. Third, the court rejected the owner's argument that O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-13-49(n) violated his right to bear arms under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. Fourth, the owner's argument under the Georgia Constitution was not raised and ruled on below, and thus, it was not addressed.

The Unified Appeal Procedure was constitutional. The denial of the request to shuffle the jury was proper. The statutory aggravating factors did not have to be included in the indictment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action by plaintiffs, class one attorneys and class two attorneys, demanding a refund of occupational taxes imposed by defendant City of Atlanta, review was sought of the Court of Appeals of Georgia's judgment affirming the finding that class one had to exhaust its administrative remedies, the recertification of class one to permit a request of tax refunds, and the holding that some refunds were barred by the limitations period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorneys, seeking a tax refund under O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-5-380, alleged that the occupation taxes imposed by the City were an unconstitutional regulation of the practice of law. The case was certified as a class action, and the attorneys were divided into two classes. Class two consisted of attorneys who had already demanded a refund, while class one consisted of attorneys who had not. The state high court determined that the City's occupation tax ordinance was unconstitutional to the extent that it included lawyers. The intermediate appellate court then issued the judgment at issue in the instant appeal. The most important factor in applying the administrative exhaustion requirement to a case involving the constitutionality of taxes was the City's need for early notice of its potential liability. The City had notice of the constitutional challenge to the validity of the occupation tax ordinance when the administrative claims and subsequent lawsuits were filed by the attorneys. Thus, the named attorneys, who had exhausted their administrative remedies, satisfied the exhaustion requirement of the class one attorneys, as the named attorneys acted on behalf of the entire class.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff challenger appealed the order finding the statute constitutional, while the incumbent appealed from an order denying her motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenger alleged that O.C.G.A. &sect; 21-2-494 was unconstitutional merely because it impermissibly allowed the exclusion of votes for write-in candidates and because it did not require that voters be provided with notice that write-in votes for unqualified candidates would not be counted. The instant court disagreed. The Board of Registration and Elections (Board) considered the write-in votes, as it was required to, in order to determine whether the votes had been cast for constitutionally qualified candidates. Further, no voters were disenfranchised, as there was no dispute that the write-in candidates were not eligible to serve. Third, no merit was given to the challenger's argument that O.C.G.A. &sect; 21-2-494 was unconstitutional for failing to require that voters be given notice that write-in votes for unqualified write-in candidates would not be counted. As to the incumbent's appeal, the challenger's failure to name the Board as a party defendant did not warrant dismissal, as said failure was an amendable defect, correctable by the parties or upon the court's own motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the murders of two victims and with related crimes. The State then gave notice of its intent to seek the death penalty. However, defendant was granted an interim review of the proceedings up to that point. The parties were thus directed to address issues pertaining to the same.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the trial court erred in (1) denying defendant's motion concerning the composition of the grand and traverse jury lists; (2) ruling that the pretrial deposition testimony of the husband of the female victim was admissible at trial; and (3) refusing to allow a second pretrial deposition of the victims' next door neighbor. The instant court found no error. First, defendant's own expert testimony showed that there was no under-representation of Hispanic citizens on the grand and traverse jury lists. Second, although defendant's opportunity for cross-examination was perhaps not ideal given the fact that he had only six days' notice of the hearing, he was afforded a sufficient opportunity to cross-examine a witness who later died, and the lack of cross-examination was the result of him waiving that opportunity. Thus, the witness's deposition was admissible at trial. Finally, because defendant had already questioned the next-door neighbor about the medications she was taking and whether in her subjective judgment her memory was affected by her medications, no abuse of discretion resulted in refusing defendant's request for any additional cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding no error in the proceedings thus far, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The state's highest court held that the evidence supported the conviction. Any error in notifying defendant of the statutory aggravating circumstances was harmless. Challenges to the discretion of district attorneys to decide whether to pursue the death penalty had been rejected. O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-30(b)(7) was not unconstitutional. Qualifying prospective jurors based upon their death penalty views did not violate defendant's right to an impartial jury. Nine prospective jurors were properly excused. Defendant was not entitled to a new trial on the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon charge. The trial on the possession of a firearm charge did not impermissibly place defendant's character in issue at sentencing. The evidence supported the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon conviction. The jury was properly instructed at sentencing. The kidnapping offense was properly the basis of an aggravating circumstance. The death sentence was not imposed under any arbitrary factor and the statutory aggravating circumstances were supported by the evidence.

The appellate court held that the evidence supported the conviction. Defendant left his nine-month-old and three-year-old sons unsupervised on the upper floor of a two-story home near an unprotected downward flight of stairs, which was a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise and was in conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk such that his act endangered the children's safety. Section 16-5-60(b) was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that it prohibited a person from leaving one's children, one an infant and the other a toddler, unsupervised on the upper floor of a two-story home that was not equipped with any device to keep the children from falling down a nearby flight of stairs. Finally, defendant's theory that he had no legal duty to the children, despite being their father, since he did not live with them was rejected. There was no harmful error in the officer's recitation of the factors that led him or her to initiate the reckless conduct charges against defendant.</SPAN></P>

I(b) dealt with how same-sex relationships were treated, was a different subject than defining marriage as the union of man and woman, and so, the section violated the multiple subject matter rule, Ga. Const. art. X, &sect; I, para. II. The appellate court found that the objective of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; IV, para. I was the non-recognition of same sex conjugal relationships and to define marriage exclusively as the union between man and woman. The commonality of those expressions was exclusiveness, establishing that marriage and its attendant benefits belonged only to unions of man and woman. That exclusiveness was the essence of the amendment's purpose. The prohibition against recognizing same-sex unions as entitled to the benefits of marriage was not &quot;dissimilar and discordant&quot; to the objective of reserving the status of marriage and its attendant benefits exclusively to unions of man and woman. Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; IV, para. I(b) did not address a different objective than that of the amendment as a whole and did not render the amendment violative of the multiple-subject matter rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Notwithstanding a plea bargain in the underlying case pursuant to which the criminal defendant agreed to a 15-year sentence, the panel reduced her sentence to 8 years. The trial court found that the district attorney lacked standing to bring his case because he was only authorized to recommend a sentence to be imposed at the discretion of the trial court and, thus, has no interest at stake when the panel reduced a sentence. The appellate court held that, because the district attorney's complaint did not seek enforcement of the panel's performance of its public duties, but challenged the validity of the duties that the general assembly authorized it to exercise, he lacked standing to attack the constitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-6 by means of mandamus. However, the complaint also sought an injunction against enforcement of &sect; 17-10-6, which he alleged was unconstitutional. Among the district attorney's official responsibilities was the obligation to challenge, on constitutional grounds, a statute which allegedly interfered with his authority as a judicial officer to negotiate binding plea agreements in criminal cases. Thus he had standing to seek an injunction.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also held that if in the county's estimation limiting the number and size of signs in residential areas was the only way to maintain the aesthetic goals it wished to maintain, the trial court would not question its conclusion. The appellate court held that, in considering the constitutionality of ordinances restricting free speech, the courts were required to review the ordinance closely to ensure that it was narrowly drawn to serve the governmental interest. In conducting this close review, a court was not permitted to merely defer to the discretion of the governmental entity imposing the ordinance. In this case, the trial court improperly deferred without question to the decisions made at the discretion of the county without receiving any evidence or fully considering whether the ordinance was the least restrictive means of achieving the county's goals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient sued defendant hospital, and others, alleging medical malpractice. The hospital moved to transfer venue to a different county. The State Court of Bibb County (Georgia) held, inter alia, that O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-10-31(c) was unconstitutional, declined to transfer case pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-10-31.1(a), and denied the motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital argued that the O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-10-31.1(a) factors of forum non conveniens supported transferring the case to Pulaski County in that, inter alia, the patient was a resident of Pulaski County, the hospital was in Pulaski County, the patient's medical records were in Pulaski County, and all interactions between the patient and the several defendants occurred in Pulaski County. The appellate court disagreed. Initially, the trial court properly ruled that O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-10-31(c) was unconstitutional. The hospital failed to meet its burden of showing an abuse of the trial court's discretion in the denial of the motion to transfer. There was no showing that litigating the matter in Bibb County, where several of the defendants resided, posed difficulties with regard to interviewing or securing witnesses and evidence or that relocating the case to Pulaski County would allow easier access. Further, since Bibb and Pulaski Counties were not at great distance from one another, it was difficult to accept the assertions that what was at issue affected the receipt of medical care solely in Pulaski County or that there was no local interest in deciding the case in Bibb County.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the trial court (Georgia) convicted defendant of two counts of aggravated child molestation and one count of statutory rape. The trial court imposed a mandatory sentence for aggravated child molestation of 10 years without parole pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-4(d)(1) and O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-6.1. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his mandatory sentence for aggravated child molestation of 10 years without parole was cruel and unusual punishment as applied to him. Defendant contended that his crime should have been given special treatment and excepted from the mandated punishment because he was 18 at the time of the act and the victim was only 4 years younger. The appellate court found, however, that the law at the time of the commission of the crime provided no such exception, and, because the required punishment did not unconstitutionally shock the conscience, defendant's sentence stood. Defendant, a legal adult, pursued the victim and got her to agree to have sex with him and another male friend at the same time, despite the fact that the victim's parents previously told him that she was only 14 years old. Based on these facts and applying the requisite deference to the legislative branch's authority to impose punishment based on the mores of society at the time of the crime, defendant's sentence was appropriate under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-4(d)(1) and was not so disproportionate as to shock the conscience.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the county's actions did not rise to an inverse condemnation, which was necessary for recovery of damages. The appellate court agreed. The residents were allowed to recover if and only if the trespass or nuisance amounted to the taking of property without just compensation. The county's approval of the construction of the waste transfer facility and its issuance of building permits did not subject it to liability for inverse condemnation or for any claim rising to that level. The issuance of citations for violation of the nuisance ordinance did not show that the county was responsible for maintaining a nuisance. The trial court also correctly held that a waste transfer facility was a permissible use in the general industrial district. There was at least some evidence presented in opposition to the corporation's summary judgment motion which showed that its facility generated odor, noise, dust, and various pests, and that these conditions resulted in disturbance, discomfort, and annoyance to the residents and a diminution in the value of their home. Glynn County, Ga., Ordinance &sect; 2-16-237 was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The high court held that as this evidence was sufficient to prove that the murder might have been committed in DeKalb County, the proper trial venue under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-2-2(h) was proved to be in that county. The evidence, including defendant's incriminating statements to fellow inmates, was sufficient to convict. Evidence of defendant's attempted rape of one woman and his kidnapping and sexual molestation of another, which occurred 17 and 12 years earlier, respectively, was properly admitted to show plan and scheme, motive, intent and frame of mind, including lustful disposition; the time interval was acceptable.

Laws 1482, &sect; 1, the county created a special taxing and spending district (SSD) that included all of its unincorporated areas, including noncontiguous areas separated by incorporated municipalities. It collected taxes and fees to pay for services provided exclusively within its SSD, but did not limit the expenditure of this revenue to the area in which it was collected. After the incorporation of a city within its borders, it filed the instant action. It argued that &sect; 36-31-12(b) was inapplicable to its existing SSD because &sect; 36-31-12(b) applied only when noncontiguous areas were first created by the incorporation of a new municipality. The trial court held that &sect; 36-31-12(b) did not apply only to SSDs with newly created noncontiguous areas, and appellate court concurred. Section &sect; 36-31-12(b) did not violate the Georgia Constitution by encroaching on the county's exclusive authority, derived from 1972 Ga. Laws 1482, &sect; 1, over the collection and expenditure of revenues collected within its SSD; 1972 Ga. Laws 1482, &sect; 1 granted concurrent authority to the county and legislature over this matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged her conviction. However, none of her claims warranted reversal. First, her failure to yield to uniformed police officer driving a marked police vehicle supported the conviction, and whether her failure to stop was wilful was a question for the jury upon consideration of the words, conduct, demeanor, motive, and all other circumstances connected with the act. Second, inasmuch as her motion to quash the accusation contested the authenticity of the State's evidence and did not attack the accusation for a facial defect, denial of the motion was not erroneous. Third, the pursuing officer was not called upon to exercise the legislative function of defining what constituted a crime, but the executive branch function of enforcing the law. Fourth, there was no constitutional requirement that a criminal statute had to contain a statement that a justification defense be asserted. Fifth, denial of a motion in arrest of judgment was not error, as the State Court of Douglas County had subject-matter jurisdiction over the case. Finally, since defendant was not found guilty of a wilful failure to stop, her contention that she could not be tried for the same was moot.</SPAN></P>

The instant court first held that the homeowners did not have a constitutional due process right to pursue any claim which was paramount to the legislature's constitutional authority to create, modify, or abolish the right to sue. Second, &sect; 12-2-2(c)(3)(B) did not bar the homeowners from seeking redress in the courts for the injury they allegedly sustained but was a legislative limitation on standing to appeal an order rendered by the Director. But, the flaw in the homeowners' claims was that the intent underlying &sect; 12-2-2(c)(3)(B) was to preclude attacks on the Director's determination of the scope of remedial measures set forth in consent orders issued under the Hazardous Site Response Act. Until they obtain a full satisfaction, the homeowners could pursue all available legal remedies against those responsible for polluting their property. However, insofar as administrative remedies were concerned, the homeowners did not have standing to appeal the Director's consent orders unless and until she sought to enforce them.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court agreed with the trial court, however, that &sect; 16-11-34(a) was overbroad. Under the literal language of the statute, the only proof required was that the person recklessly or knowingly committed any act that may reasonably have been expected to prevent or disrupt a lawful meeting, gathering or procession. It did not matter where or when the accused committed the proscribed act, or even whether the act, upon its commission, resulted in any actual prevention or disruption. The literal language of the statute was so overbroad in its scope that it led to an absurdity manifestly not intended by the legislature, and its constitutionality could not have been preserved by judicial construction.</SPAN></P>

The court also directed the wife to pay $ 500 attorney fees to the estate. The wife sought further review, which was granted, and this matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The incorporated agreement at issue expressly provided that the ex-husband's obligation to pay the car and furniture debts, and the wife's right to live in the marital home he owned, expressly survived his death, but no such express provision was made regarding the payment of periodic alimony. But, after deciding not to depart from the general rule of retroactivity of judicial decisions, since the provision entitling the wife to alimony until she remarried or died did not evidence a manifest intention to reverse the normal rule that the death of the obligor terminated the obligation to pay alimony, and the settlement agreement lacked a clear expression of intent to extend alimony payments beyond the death of the ex-husband, the trial court properly denied the wife's motion to hold the estate responsible for the alimony obligation. Second, if the award of attorney fees to the estate was predicated on O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-15-14(b), it was erroneous, as the findings necessary to support such an award were not made. Further, if attorney's fee were based on O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-6-2, it was also erroneous, as there was no evidence of the parties' financial circumstances that authorized such an award.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-8-4(c)(2) contained an unconstitutional mandatory presumption. The appellate court agreed. The statutory presumption in &sect; 16-8-4(c)(2) was mandatory; if the State proved that the demand letter was sent in accordance with the statute, the defendant &quot;shall be presumed&quot; to have committed the elements of the crime. The State's presentation of its case relied on the statutory presumption. The trial court pronounced defendant guilty immediately after restating its ruling that the mandatory presumption was constitutional, and the trial court thus considered itself bound by the mandatory language in &sect; 16-8-4(c)(2). The mandatory presumption applied to both the fact of conversion and defendant's intent, and the evidence was not overwhelming. Thus, the error was not harmless. However, defendant failed in her assertion that, without the operation of the presumption, the State presented insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction, and thus, retrial of defendant was allowed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate cases, one alleging medical malpractice, a Georgia trial court held that O.C.G.A. &sect;&nbsp;9-10-31(c) was unconstitutional, as applied in the first action, but that &sect; 9-10-31(c) was not unconstitutional as applied in the second. Both defendants and plaintiff appealed, and the court granted a consolidated review of both judgments. The second action also involved the interpretation of O.C.G.A. &sect;&nbsp;9-10-31.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On an appeal from the first action, defendants argued that O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-10-31(c) was authorized by Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; II, para. VIII. But, even if it was not, the statute did not violate the Constitution's joint tortfeasor provision. They further alleged that O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-10-31(c) authorized a venue transfer from one county where venue was proper to another county where venue was proper. The instant court disagreed. Also &sect; 9-10-31(c) was not a proper exercise of the legislature's authority to enact laws which allowed the superior and state courts to change venue. In the second case, one of the defendants moved to transfer venue pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-10-31.1(a). The plaintiff alleged that the trial court erred, and defendants alleged that &sect; 9-10-31.1(a) was authorized by Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; II, para. VIII, and thus did not conflict with Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; II, para. IV. The court held that because O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-10-31.1(a) vested power to change venue in the court, and not in a defendant, as did O.C.G.A. &sect;&nbsp;9-10-31(c), O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-10-31.1(a) was a proper under Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; II, para. VIII, and did not violate Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; II, para. IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first action, the judgment was affirmed. In the second action, the constitutionality finding was reversed but retroactive application of the forum non conveniens statute was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stole a car, drove to a bank, and robbed the teller at gunpoint. Defendant then fatally shot a driver while attempting to escape in his car. After shooting at another individual, defendant eventually surrendered. He was convicted and sentenced to death for the malice murder. On appeal, the convictions were affirmed but the death sentence was reversed. A resentencing trial was held and the jury again recommended death upon finding two statutory aggravating circumstances pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-30(b)(1) and (3). On appeal, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the aggravating circumstances. The Georgia death penalty statutes and use of a lethal injection were not unconstitutional, and use of a stun belt at the hearing was proper, based on defendant's prior threats to the prosecutor. Evidentiary errors were either waived for appellate review or lacked merit. There were no errors with respect to prospective jurors, as each indicated that they could decide the appropriate sentence based on the evidence. Imposition of a death sentence on the felony murder conviction, which had been previously vacated, was error. The sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court with respect to imposition of the death sentence. The court vacated the sentence imposed on the conviction for felony murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant financially exploited an 89-year-old widower by befriending him, acting as a lawyer, and obtaining his property and forging or coercing signatures on estate documents.

The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the statutes, and defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. Denial of suppression of the contents of defendant's briefcase, which contained the forged documents, was proper. Defendant had it after he was arrested and booked, and it was searched incident to the arrest and for inventory purposes. Defendant's vagueness challenge was not reviewed, as he lacked standing to raise it, and the equal protection argument was deemed abandoned. O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-19-51(a)(7) did not limit defendant's right to free speech in violation of U.S. Const. amend. I and Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, para.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the venue provision of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-9-125 violated Ga. Const. art. art. VI, &sect; II, para. VI, which required that the venue of a criminal case be set in the county where the crime was committed. The state's highest court held that the nature of identity fraud was the protection of the personal information contained in the victim's records. That information was deemed to be in the lawful possession of the victim, so that when a defendant violated O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-9-121 by engaging in an unauthorized access to the records, he engaged in the fraudulent use of information located in the county where the victim resided or was found. Since the crime of identity fraud, as defined by O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 16-9-121 and 16-9-125 when read in para materia, took place in the county where the victim and his or her personal information were located, there was no constitutional bar to trying the defendant in that county. O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-9-125 complied with the constitutional mandate. As it was alleged that defendant committed the crime of identity fraud in Clayton County by using personal information that was in the lawful possession of a resident of that county, venue was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant consented to a search of his home, which produced photographs of nude young females from a folder on defendant's computer. Defendant was indicted on 21 counts of sexual exploitation of children. His motion to dismiss, based on the asserted unconstitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-12-100, was denied. A bench trial was held, at which an expert witness testified that the persons in the photographs were under the age of 18. Defendant was convicted of 12 counts. On appeal, defendant claimed that the exemptions in &sect; 16-12-100(d) made the statute unconstitutional because there was no express exemption for the defense in a criminal prosecution. The court found that defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute, as he could not show that the statute adversely impacted his rights because he had made no effort to obtain the materials seized from his home for the purpose of preparing for trial. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions, and the issue of whether equal access rebutted the inference of possession was within the province of the trier of fact.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the office of mayor was not abolished in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 1-3-11, local legislation passed by the general assembly to accomplish the change was not unconstitutional, and defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council voted unanimously to change the city's government from a strong mayor/weak council system to a weak mayor/strong council system with a city manager, and the legislature passed an enabling act. The supreme court held this act amending the city charter did not abolish the mayor's office. Transferring duties on which the political power of the mayor's office was based to the council or city manager did not violate O.C.G.A. &sect; 1-3-11. Nothing in &sect; 1-3-11 barred altering the mayor's duties as long as his remaining duties were appropriate to the office. No referendum was required under &sect; 1-3-11 as the act did not abolish his office, nor was a public hearing required, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 28-1-14. The act's lack of language on council votes needed to approve the mayor's committee recommendations did not make the act invalid, given the city charter. The mayor, who was African-American, showed no equal protection violation, nor did he rebut evidence that the council enacted a more efficient form of government. He showed no unconstitutional diminution in African-American voters' political power, as he did not show the act was a purposeful device to further racial discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that &sect;&nbsp;16-13-30.3(b)(1) was constitutional as it created classifications with a rational basis in combatting the illicit drug trade. Further, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. &quot;Ephedrine,&quot; &quot;pseudoephedrine,&quot; and &quot;phenylpropanolamine&quot; were so similar to one another that each was considered a functional equivalent of the others. The State's expert witness testified that ephedrine and pseudoephedrine had the exact same chemical formulas and had the same effect on a body. The evidence supported the convictions. The equal access rule did not apply as defendant also made inculpatory admissions. The random testing of only two of the 2,329 tablets did not require an acquittal as the expert testified that the rest of the tablets all had the same logo and appearance; she also opined that all of the tablets contained pseudoephedrine. There was not a fatal variance, even though the accusation charged defendant with possession of ephedrine, but the proof showed that the tablets contained pseudoephedrine. For purposes of &sect; 16-13-30.3, &quot;ephedrine&quot; and &quot;pseudoephedrine&quot; were synonymous.</SPAN></P>

At his first trial, the State redacted the burglary count from the indictment and proceeded only on the count of false imprisonment. However, a mistrial occurred. At his retrial, the State tried him on both the burglary and false imprisonment counts. He was convicted on both counts. The trial court then denied his motion for a new trial. On appeal, the state supreme court found that the evidence sufficiently supported the convictions, retrial on the burglary charge did not violate his double jeopardy rights, Georgia's false imprisonment statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-41(a), was not unconstitutionally vague, defendant was properly sentenced, and no error occurred in denying his motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first of two cases consolidated for appeal, the Court of Appeals (Georgia) found that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the results of a blood test following a traffic accident. In the second case, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court and found that defendant's refusal to submit to a blood test following an accident should have been suppressed. The State and one defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, defendant argued that he was not properly placed under arrest before the reading of his implied consent rights. The appellate court found that before the reading of his implied consent rights, defendant was involved in a traffic accident resulting in serious injuries to himself and the investigating officer had probable cause to believe that defendant was driving under the influence. Under these circumstances, the investigating officer was not required to arrest defendant before the reading of implied consent rights, and defendant's consent to the blood test was valid. Because defendant in the second case was not involved in a traffic accident resulting in serious injuries or fatalities as set forth in O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-55(a), his refusal should have been suppressed. None of the &sect; 40-5-55(a) situations was present as defendant's paralysis was not listed as one of the maladies on the very specific list provided by the legislature. Accordingly, the rules associated with the reading of implied consent rights to a suspect following a traffic accident with serious injuries or fatalities did not apply, and the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted that he murdered the victim, who was eight or nine months pregnant. Defendant picked up the victim. After the victim stripped naked, defendant pinned her arms to the ground, choked her, and stabbed her in the throat and chest. Defendant also murdered three prostitutes. Where one prospective juror made a comment that defendant killed redheads and where that juror was later excused, the trial court did not err in refusing to excuse other prospective jurors. The parties individually questioned the relevant prospective jurors about the redheads remark and other conversation that the victim had been pregnant. The information that the victim had been pregnant and was murdered was to be presented at trial. Defendant's trial was not affected by pretrial publicity since all of the qualified jurors indicated that they could decide the case by only considering the evidence presented. Defendant was not entitled to have his death sentence vacated on mental illness grounds. O.C.G.A. &sect;&nbsp;17-7-131 did not preclude a death sentence on mental illness grounds. Also, there was no constitutional prohibition against a death sentence for a competent but mentally ill defendant.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held it had previously decided that when a court had no jurisdiction to try a defendant, any conviction entered by that court was null and void, but a defendant whose conviction was so voided could be retried without the attachment of procedural double jeopardy. As a result, defendant could be retried on the felony indictment in the trial court. Any substantive double jeopardy issues that might arise if defendant was convicted were not decided.

The appellate court found that the trial court's action in permitting the entry of a nolle prosequi was not attributable to defendant. The trial court erred in permitting the entry of a nolle prosequi after jeopardy attached and defendant, in light of his objection and request for a remedy to perceived state of the case that would not have resulted in an acquittal as a matter of law, did not induce the error. Amendment of the accusation did not start a new prosecution, the previous arraignment was sufficient, and jeopardy attached before the nolle prosequi was entered over defendant's objection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business purchased the leasehold and assets of a prior business that primarily sold sexually-explicit materials (SEM) to a mostly male clientele. The prior business had been denied a special use permit to operate a sexually-oriented adult use (SOAU). Thereafter, the new business reduced the inventory of SEM and added adult-themed but non-SEM that catered to a broader clientele. The county sought injunctive relief after the business began operating without a special use permit, asserting that a permit was needed because the business qualified as a SOAU due to its &quot;substantial business purpose&quot; of offering SEM for sale. The trial court rejected constitutional challenges to the Development Code, and permanently enjoined the business's operation. On appeal, the court found that the definition of a SOAU, based on the finding of the requisite substantial business purpose, was void for vagueness under the due process clauses of the Georgia and U.S. Constitutions, as there was no fair notice or objective standards for business owners regarding whether they needed to meet the permit requirements, nor were there clear guidelines for enforcement purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 46-5-21(a)(1) impermissibly infringed upon his right to free speech protected by the First Amendment and Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. V. The state's highest court agreed that the statute was an overbroad infringement on the right to free speech. Expression that was indecent but was not obscene was protected speech. The statute lacked the precision that the First Amendment required when a statute regulated the content of speech. It did not contain the necessary language setting out the least restrictive means to further a compelling state interest. Instead of applying only to obscene speech, it applied to speech that was merely indecent. Instead of making illegal such speech only when directed at minors, it made such speech illegal when heard by adults. Instead of applying only to speech not welcomed by the listener and spoken with intent to harass, it applied to speech welcomed by the listener and spoken with intent to please or amuse. Because the statute was an overbroad infringement on the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech, defendant's convictions for violating the unconstitutional statute were reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was a Georgia resident with a Georgia license whose Florida license had been revoked for driving under the influence. The state's highest court distinguished persons affected by &sect;&nbsp;40-5-22(c)(2) from Georgia residents who lacked a negative out-of-state driving record. The issuance of the Georgia license was error. Further, the driver was not similarly situated to Georgia drivers whose licenses were revoked. Section 40-5-22(c)(2) did not create a suspect class or impact a fundamental right for equal protection purposes. There was a rational basis to create a class of driver's license applicants whose out-of-state licenses were suspended or revoked. The classification bore a direct relation to the strong governmental interests in protecting the public from drivers whose licenses had been revoked and in preventing license shopping. The driver's equal protection challenge to &sect; 40-5-22(c)(7) also failed. The driver voluntarily subjected himself to Florida's laws and his Florida license was validly suspended. Neither state was precluded from taking into account offenses that occurred in another state in deciding whether to issue or revoke an already issued driver's license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was cited for creating a nuisance due to an accumulation of refuse on her property, in violation of Cherokee County, Ga., Code of Ordinances &sect; 46-61(d).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The state's highest court held that &quot;litter&quot; and &quot;rubbish&quot; were defined in the county code. While the two definitions were not all-inclusive, they provided examples of the type of substances that could not be accumulated without creating a nuisance. The examples provided adequate guidance so that it could be readily ascertained whether an item was litter or rubbish. While litter and rubbish might be subjective, such uncertainties did not render the statute void for vagueness. The statute gave sufficient warning so that individuals could avoid doing that which was forbidden. It also could be readily ascertained whether a person was &quot;accumulating&quot; a quantity of rubbish or litter on their property. Defendant lacked standing to claim that the ordinance improperly delegated the decision as to what constituted an accumulation of litter to local law-enforcement authorities. The ordinance did not restrict defendant's use of land without a substantial governmental interest as it clearly protected the public health, safety and welfare. Finally, the State satisfied its burden to establish venue beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Bartow County trial court (Georgia), which convicted defendant of malice murder, three counts of felony murder, aggravated battery, two counts of aggravated assault, two counts of false imprisonment, theft by taking, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Defendant received a death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from his actions with regard to having been the gunman and apparent leader in a carjacking, kidnapping, and execution-style murder of one victim and the attempted execution-style murder of a second victim. The jury recommended a death sentence for the malice murder conviction after it found three statutory aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt: that the offense of murder was committed by defendant during the commission of an armed robbery and during the commission of a kidnapping with bodily injury and that the murder was committed by defendant for himself or another for the purpose of receiving money or another thing of monetary value. The court addressed each allegation of error raised by defendant and found no reversible error. Specifically, conflicting evidence was presented with regard to defendant's alleged mental retardation, which issue was properly submitted to the jury for determination. The jury was given a proper charge on mental retardation. A failure to change the venue of the trial was not erroneous because the pretrial media coverage was neither so extensive nor inflammatory to have created an atmosphere of hostility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment but vacated the statutory aggravating circumstance, which the court noted did not affect defendant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a condemnation action, a special master awarded appellant landowners damages as just and adequate compensation for their land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners challenged the judgment entered against them, first contending that the trial court erred by ruling against their claim that O.C.G.A. &sect; 22-2-84.1 was unconstitutional. The appeals court disagreed. Under the special master method, the actual taking of the condemnee's property was authorized to occur before the resolution of any value issue raised by a condemnee on appeal. Further, because the right to take an appeal to superior court and have a jury trial on the value issue was a matter of legislative grace, the legislature was free to impose conditions on the exercise of the right to appeal. Second, the landowners were not denied due process by a denial of their motion for a continuance to review 64 pages of billing records, as they were previously notified of the intent to offer the same into evidence and made no request for discovery regarding the issue. Finally, the instruction given on the issue of temporary inconvenience properly allowed the jury to determine whether the loss of the trees on the location of the temporary easement was a loss special to the landowners and thus compensable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from a Georgia trial court, convicting him of criminal attempt to possess marijuana with intent to distribute under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-13-33. The trial court denied defendant's motion to declare &sect; 16-13-33&nbsp;unconstitutional and to impose sentence under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-4-6. Accordingly, defendant was sentenced under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-13-33 to 10 years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested during a reverse undercover sting operation for the sale of a large amount of marijuana. When the undercover detective asked to see the money, defendant and another drove up and showed the money to him. As the arresting officers moved in, defendant's passenger opened fire and was killed by return shots fired by police. Defendant fled but was shortly captured. He was convicted and sentenced, and he appealed. The court first determined that defendant's constitutional challenge to O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-13-33, which was made shortly after the guilty verdict was returned, was timely. There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction. The court found that defendant had abandoned his constitutional arguments by failing to provide citation or authority or argument in support thereof, leaving only his claim involving the rule of lenity. However, the court found that there was no violation of that rule, as O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 16-13-33 and 16-4-6 were mutually exclusive. Accordingly, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-13-33 rendered O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-4-6 inapplicable, as the former was applicable specifically to offenses involving the Georgia Controlled Substances Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-13-20 et seq.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried as an adult under O.C.G.A. &sect;&nbsp;15-11-28 and was convicted by the trial court (Georgia) for malice murder, felony murder, and aggravated assault, after his motion for a mistrial was denied. He was sentenced to life in prison for malice murder, with the aggravated assault conviction merging as a matter of fact and the felony murder conviction being treated as surplusage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 15-11-28 was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that defendant waived any constitutional claims. Evidence that defendant approached a car, exchanged words with the victim, produced a rifle, and shot the victim two times at point-blank range, killing him as his children watched, was sufficient to support the conviction. The trial court did not err by failing to sua sponte rule on defendant's competency. The request that competency hearings be mandated for children who faced trial as adults was rejected. The prosecutor improperly asked a witness whether he was aware that defendant told his mother that he &quot;only shot him twice.&quot; Hearsay testimony from two police officers was improperly admitted. The jury was improperly instructed that it could infer the intent to kill from the use of a deadly weapon. However, the errors were harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt. The trial court took corrective measures after the first reference to defendant's pre-trial silence and defendant failed to request a curative instruction or a mistrial after the second. Finally, trial counsel was not ineffective as the decisions were reasonable or strategic.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A warden sought review of the judgment of a habeas court (Georgia), which granted a prisoner's habeas petition, holding that the trial court erred in allowing two witnesses to testify in defendant's trial on charges of molestation about an outcry made by the victim after the last instance of her alleged molestation because O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-16 could not be applied in any trial for a crime committed before the effective date of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the prisoner's convictions on three counts of aggravated child molestation were affirmed on appeal, the prisoner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that since the acts of molestation with which he was charged preceded the effective date of &sect; 24-3-16, which permitted the State to introduce evidence in the form of hearsay statements attributed to a child victim, the trial court improperly permitted the two witnesses to testify about the victim's outcry. The habeas court granted the petition. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 24-3-16 was not subject to the prisoner's ex post facto challenge because it did not alter the degree, or lessen the amount or measure of the proof, which was made necessary to conviction when the crime was committed. According to the court, when the prisoner committed the alleged acts of aggravated child molestation, the State was required to prove that he committed that crime as it was then defined, and the prosecution had exactly that same evidentiary burden as to the elements of aggravated child molestation when he was brought to trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had overruled the van driver's objection to the admissibility of a narrative medical report from one of the car driver's physicians, pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-18(a). The matter was transferred from the Georgia Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The van driver struck the car driver from behind, causing her injuries. Appellees gave a timely pre-trial notice that they intended to introduce the medical report pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-18(a), and the trial court overruled the van driver's objection thereto. After the jury verdict was rendered in favor of appellees, the van driver sought review. The matter was transferred by the court of appeals because the appeal raised constitutional issues. The court initially found that the oath of O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-9-60 was not implicated due to the admissibility of the medical report under O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-18(a). Further, there was no denial of the van driver's right to cross-examine the physician, and he had ample opportunity to determine the expert qualifications of the medical professional. The van driver lacked standing to raise an equal protection challenge on behalf of the non-medical professionals whose reports were not excluded from the hearsay rule, and there was no due process violation because the reports which were admissible under &sect; 24-3-18 were clearly delineated. There was no racial motive found in appellees' juror strikes, and the evidence supported the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Georgia trial court convicted defendant on charges of terroristic threat and criminal trespass in one indictment, and to a count of burglary in another. For each of these three crimes, he received first offender treatment and a probated sentence. The court later revoked his probation in each of the two cases. Defendant thereafter appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgments entered against him, first contending that the filing of the petitions by his probation supervisor was unauthorized because O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-8-29 violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers. The appeals court disagreed, holding that the probation supervisor's duty extended only to making her findings and report thereon in writing to the court with her recommendation. By filing the revocation petitions, she did not initiate any new criminal action in the trial court against defendant. Further, the petitions invoked the continuing jurisdiction that the trial court already exercised pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-8-34(g). Second, the petitions filed against defendant were sufficient to comply with due process requirements, and in neither case was defendant unable to adequately prepare his defense. Third, although the trial court violated O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-10, said error was harmless as any inadmissible hearsay was merely cumulative of the admissible probative testimony. Finally, the fact that defendant was not represented by an attorney in the prior revocation proceedings did not affect the admissibility of the orders entered therein.</SPAN></P>

The trial court (Georgia) denied their motions and sentenced defendants pursuant to &sect; 17-10-17. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, along with a third individual, were indicted on charges of aggravated assault and other crimes arising out of the beating of the victims. Pursuant to the notice provisions of the hate crime penalty statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-18, the State served defendants with notice of the State's intent to seek sentence enhancement based on the State's allegation that defendants selected their victims because of racial bias and prejudice. However, absent some qualification on &quot;bias or prejudice,&quot; O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-17 was left so vague that persons of common intelligence had to necessarily guess at its meaning and differed as to its application. Accordingly, the appellate court held that &sect; 17-10-17 was too vague to justify the imposition of enhanced criminal punishment for its violation. Also, &sect; 17-10-17 could not be upheld because it impermissibly delegated basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory applications. Because the enhancement statute was unconstitutionally vague, it violated defendants' due process rights and their sentences were improper.</SPAN></P>

Defendant confessed to police, after he waived his Miranda rights, that he set fire to his son's bedding while his son was asleep, intending to scare his girlfriend and planning to return and put out the fire, but that the smoke and flames &quot;got to&quot; the children. Neighbors and firefighters reported that defendant did not try to save his children, that his demeanor was cold, and that he moved his car away from the trailer. Defendant was convicted of malice murder and sentenced to death for each of the murders. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not err by limiting a psychologist's testimony concerning false confession theory because the knowledge that a false confession could be obtained from a suspect by police was not beyond the ken of the average juror; and it was implicit in the jury charges on the voluntariness, credibility, and corroboration of a defendant's statement to the police under O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 24-3-50, 24-3-53.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The longshoreman's injury occurred on a ship in navigable waters while he was engaged in traditional maritime activity. The supreme court held the Ports Authority was immune under the Georgia Constitution, but admiralty law preempted this and any state procedural requirements, and governed the longshoreman's claim and his wife's loss of consortium claim. The Authority was not an arm of the State for Eleventh Amendment immunity purposes, because it was self-sufficient and not intertwined with the State's treasury. Factors of state law and state control tended to weigh towards a finding of no immunity. This was not contrary to finding the Authority was entitled to state-conferred sovereign immunity as a state court decision that the Authority was a state &quot;agency&quot; for state immunity was different from finding under federal law that the Authority was not an &quot;arm of the state&quot; for Eleventh Amendment immunity purposes. Because the Authority was not immune under the Eleventh Amendment, and the ship owner's contribution and indemnity claim was recognized in admiralty and maritime law, there was no bar to that claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to revoke defendant's probation. Defendant, who pled guilty to child molestation, was granted discretionary review of an order entered by the trial court (Georgia), which upheld the constitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-13, found defendant in violation of the statute, and continued defendant's probation provided that he relocate to a new residence within 10 day.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 42-1-13 was an unconstitutional ex post facto law when applied to him as the statute went into effect while defendant was on probation. Defendant had lived in a house located within 303 feet of a municipal community center for over 15 years and his continued residence in that house violated the statute. The appellate court held that &sect; 42-1-13 was not being applied retrospectively. Section 42-1-13 did not alter the consequences for the offense of child molestation; rather, it created a new crime based in part on an offender's status as a child molester. The new statute did not increase the punishment meted out to previously convicted sex offenders. It did not punish sex offenders retrospectively on the basis of their status. It simply declared that convicted sex offenders who currently resided within certain well-defined areas were guilty of a felony. If a convicted offender violated the statute, he could be prosecuted (or have his probation revoked) for that current violation. Defendant was being punished for currently violating &sect; 42-1-13 by refusing to move. Defendant's new crime sparked his probation revocation.</SPAN></P>

There was evidence that the magistrate was no longer regularly exercising the powers of a magistrate at least 40 hours a week, and he declined to certify the number of actual hours he did work.  A chief magistrate working less than full-time was not entitled to the salary of a full-time chief magistrate. The trial court did not rule on the constitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-10-23(a)(3), and the appellate court declined to address the issue because it did not rule on a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute unless the issue was raised and ruled on in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The probationer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In August 2003, the probation officer of the probationer notified him that he would be required to vacate his residence because he was living within 1,000 feet of a child care facility in violation of &sect; 42-1-13. The probationer filed suit, arguing that &sect; 42-1-13 was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that whatever minimal property interest the probationer might have had in residing in his parent's home was substantially outweighed by the State's interests underlying the Residency Statute. The Residency Statute had very little economic impact on the probationer and there was no evidence that the probationer had any investment-backed expectations relative to the property. In no sense did the Residency Statute's application impose a burden upon the probationer that should have been borne by society-at-large. Thus, the appellate court rejected the probationer's claim that the Residency Statute permitted the regulatory taking of property without just and adequate compensation. In addition, the appellate court found that &sect; 42-1-13 was not unconstitutionally vague. Also, the appellate court found that O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-12, the Registered Offender Statute, was not overbroad.</SPAN></P>

Comp. R. &amp; Regs. Rules 272-2-.01(19)(h)(3) and 272-2-.09(1)(b)(10) were unconstitutional.

The trial court again granted summary judgment in the DCH's favor, finding that the regulations were constitutional. The company appealed, arguing that the procedure for approving the regulations under O.C.G.A. &sect; 31-6-21.1 violated the separation of powers doctrine under Ga. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2, para. 3 by allowing a proposed regulation to become effective by legislative inaction. It also claimed that the procedure violated the bicameralism and presentment provisions of Ga. Const. art. 3, &sect; 5, para. 5. The court held that the legislature was empowered to delegate rule making authority to administrative agencies and O.C.G.A. &sect; 31-6-21.1 did not invest the legislature with executive powers or vice versa, so there was no separation of powers problem. As regulations were not laws, the bicameralism provision was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

The intergovernmental contract between the Board and the Authority had been held to be a legal, valid, binding, and enforceable obligation of the county. The validation judgment was conclusive as to the validity of the revenue bonds and the intergovernmental contract.

The State sought the death penalty. In a pretrial motion, the State requested that the trial court (Georgia) rule that O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-12-165, which granted a criminal defendant twice as many peremptory juror challenges as the State, was unconstitutional. After a hearing, the trial court granted the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that because defendant's case involved a male defendant and two female victims, one of whom was deceased, the defense would have stricken women because they were women and that the State would have stricken men because they were men. The State surmised that, since O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-12-165 gave defendant twice as many peremptory strikes, after each side exercised 10 peremptory strikes, defendant would continued to have stricken females from the jury while the State, having exhausted all its peremptory strikes, would have been unable to strike males. The appellate court found that the Equal Protection Clause prohibited discrimination in jury selection on the basis of gender. If either party exercised any peremptory challenges with alleged discriminatory intent, a remedy already existed in the form of a Batson/J.E.B. motion. Because the law provided a remedy for jurors who were struck for illegal reasons by the defense, the order of the trial court erred in finding O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-12-165&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident argued that the request for assistance resulted in the unconstitutional creation of judgeships. The appellate court held that requesting and receiving intra-county assistance did not create a judgeship. The juvenile court judges who assisted the superior court did not become superior court judges. Thus, no judicial position constitutionally required to be filled by election or by gubernatorial appointment until election was created by the exercise of O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-1-9.1(b)(2). Further, &sect; 15-1-9.1(b)(2) did not authorize the judiciary to make appointments to the bench, but provided the means to permit a judicial officer from one court to exercise the power of a requesting court in limited circumstances. The request was neither an unconstitutional creation of a class of court nor an unconstitutional usurpation of legislative authority. The request was pursuant to &sect; 15-1-9.1(b)(2)(C) as the request was for a specified time of limited duration and any court could withdraw from participation after giving 30 days' notice. Finally, the superior, state, and juvenile courts did not take permanent action by requesting judicial assistance that spanned two terms of court.</SPAN></P>

He had a sound general knowledge of the charges and the trial process; grasped the dangers of self-representation explained to him; and knew the benefit counsel could provide. He knowingly and voluntarily waived counsel and unequivocally asserted his right to represent himself. He could be retried, as the evidence let a rational trier of fact find him guilty on each charge beyond a reasonable doubt and find at least one statutory aggravating circumstance. He could ask prospective jurors if they were conscientiously opposed to a life sentence with parole and would consider that sentence for murder. O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-12-142(a) let the trial court sequester the jury over defendant's objection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Georgia trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress all evidence derived from a traffic stop, based on an officer's suspicion that defendant violated O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-8-73.1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress, rejecting the argument that O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-8-73.1 applied only to residents of Georgia, as defendant was not situated similarly to a class being treated differently, and the legislature legitimately applied piecemeal remedies to achieve the statute's purpose of promoting the safety of law enforcement personnel. The appeals court disagreed with both holdings. Because non-residents could be as dangerous as residents, no rational connection existed between the residence of the driver of a vehicle and the goal of improving law enforcement officer safety during traffic stops. Thus, the distinction drawn by the statute violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws because it distinguished between similarly situated persons, drivers of cars registered in Georgia, on a basis which bore no reasonable relation to the purpose of the statute. However, the unconstitutionality of the statute did not require suppression, as the officer observed defendant's car, noted that the windows were tinted a dark purple, and believed the tinting appeared darker than that permitted by &sect; 40-8-73.1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county planned to enter a lease agreement with the ACCG to help finance and construct a new courthouse. The proposed agreement was designed to comply with O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-60-13. The residents sued to prevent the county from proceeding with the agreement, arguing primarily that the agreement resulted in the county incurring debt without a public vote, contrary to the mandate of Ga. Const. art. IX, &sect; V, para. I(a). When summary judgment was granted to the county, the residents appealed. They argued O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-60-13 was not constitutional and that the leases, as applied and in effect, would violate either the constitution or the statute because the leases would constitute a debt lasting for more than year. The court found its prior decisions were binding precedent that O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-60-13 was constitutional. Moreover, the county's power to terminate the contract, included for compliance with &sect; 36-60-13, was not meaningless simply because a decision to terminate would be difficult. Finally, the lease did not bind future county commissioners and it did not created a debt of more than a year that would be subject to the voting requirement in Ga. Const. art. IX, &sect; V, para.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that defendant, age 18, forcibly raped the victim, age 15. Defendant was less than three years older than the victim was. The defense claimed that the act was consensual. The appellate court found that the legislative intent was to prosecute the conduct that occurred in this case as misdemeanor statutory rape. The legislature amended O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-3(b) such that conduct meeting the criteria of the misdemeanor statute could only have been punished as a misdemeanor. It would have been incongruous with that legislative intent if the State retained the discretion to prosecute the exact same conduct as either misdemeanor statutory rape or felony child molestation, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-4(c). O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-3(b) was more specific, and thus prevailed over the more general O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-4(c). Further, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-3(b) was the most recent legislative judgment regarding the appropriate punishment for defendant's conduct. Since the legislature most recently declared that sex between teenagers less than three years apart was to be punished as misdemeanor statutory rape, and not felony child molestation, that judgment prevailed.</SPAN></P>

If the weapon was only exposed to the view of some or was not located in a closed compartment, it was not being lawfully transported within the meaning of the statute. The trial court properly overruled defendant's demurrer. The gun was accessible to an occupant of the car, but was not fully exposed to the view of others.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court erroneously entered a certification of its order pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-54(b) since the order did not dispose of any claim, but only determined that the single claim for modification was to be resolved in accordance with O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-6-15. However, the appellate court treated the certification as one entered pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 5-6-34(b). The appellate court found that the majority of the constitutional arguments advanced by the father were considered by the appellate court in an earlier case in which it held that O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-6-15 was not unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause. If Georgia had not reviewed its guidelines in the exact manner stated in 45 C.F.R. &sect; 302.56 (h), it did not &quot;do major damage&quot; to that federal interest. Because Georgia's child support guidelines plan, O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-6-15, and amendments thereto had been approved by the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services as being in conformity with the federal statutory scheme, the appellate court deferred to that determination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In post decree proceedings, appellee mother filed a complaint to modify child support and visitation, and moved for a declaration that the Georgia Child Support Guidelines found in O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-6-15(b) were unconstitutional. The trial court (Georgia) set the mother's child support amount and declared that O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-6-15 was invalid. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that Georgia had completely failed to abide by 45 C.F.R. &sect; 302.56(h), and therefore held that Georgia's child support guidelines were invalid. The trial court found that O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-6-15 was inconsistent with the federal regulation, and therefore, in violation of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution of the United States. The appellate court found that appellate jurisdiction was properly with the appellate court. Since there was no Congressional statement of pre-emption, nor was this an area in which Congress left no room for states to act, the question of pre-emption revolved around the issue of whether the child support guidelines, and the method by which they were reviewed, were an obstacle to Congressional goals. The federal interest was in obtaining child support orders to enforce the obligations of non-custodial parents. If Georgia had not reviewed its guidelines in the exact manner stated in 45 C.F.R. &sect; 302.56 (h), it did not do major damage to that federal interest. Further, the Secretary of Health and Human Services had approved and certified Georgia's plan. O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-6-15 was not unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the resident's petition. The resident appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident first argued that the ordinance violated antitrust prohibitions. The appellate court found that local government entities were immune from antitrust laws when engaged in conduct pursuant to state policy. The alleged anticompetitive conduct was conduct expressly contemplated by the Georgia Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 12-8-20 et seq. Whether the contract was beneficial and necessary to the residents was a question properly for determination by the county's commissioners. O.C.G.A. &sect; 12-8-21(a) was not violated by provisions in the ordinance authorizing the termination of a resident's collection service for nonpayment of the collection fee. Because only the amendments to the county's solid waste ordinance were placed in the record, the appellate court could not address the resident's constitutional arguments challenging alleged language in portions of the ordinance not pled and proved. The appellate court could not address complaints about the legal organ of the county because that entity was not a named party to the case, nor did the resident seek to join it in the proceedings below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, adult entertainment establishments and their employees, sought review of a judgment of the Fulton County Superior Court (Georgia) concerning appellee county's ordinance requiring any person working at an adult entertainment establishment that served alcohol to obtain a permit from the county tax commissioner. Appellants had sought an injunction and a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purpose of the ordinance was to regulate adult establishments to reduce criminal activities and to promote the protection and development of neighborhoods. The ordinance was enacted after public hearings, studies of other jurisdictions, and evidence of problems within the county. The court affirmed. The evidence established that the purpose of the ordinance was to combat secondary effects associated with adult entertainment establishments, which made the ordinance content-neutral. As a content-neutral ordinance, it could be upheld if it furthered an important government interest. The ordinance dealt with the important government interest of controlling criminal behavior and was a proper exercise of the county's police power. The fact that a fee was charged for the permit was not an unconstitutional prior restraint because the fee merely reimbursed the costs of administering the permit program. Appellants' equal protection claim, based on an argument that the ordinance was content-based, failed because the ordinance was content-neutral and such ordinances could be used to regulate adult entertainment establishments differently from other businesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Georgia trial court upheld the constitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-13-49(s)(1), and entered an order of forfeiture, in two separate cases. The forfeiture relied in part upon the hearsay evidence admitted at the hearing. The court also ruled that a search warrant executed at defendant's home was supported by probable cause. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgments entered. The appeals court first held that the purpose of the testimony provided by the officers at the forfeiture hearing was to explain the basis for seeking a warrant to search defendant's house. Thus, the testimony was admissible for such a limited purpose. However, while the police had probable cause to believe that a completed or attempted armed robbery or aggravated assault occurred at defendant's home, they had probable cause to believe that evidence related to those offenses, such as blood and hair, would be found in the house. However, they did not have sufficient reliable information to believe that defendant was selling drugs from the home. Informants were not named, and the affiant admitted that he had no personal knowledge of whether these individuals were truthful. Further, the record showed that cocaine and money were both found in closed containers which were not opened until a dog brought to the premises for the express purpose of searching for drugs alerted his handler to their presence. Under the circumstances, discovery of these items was the product of an unauthorized search for drugs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal from the original order of forfeiture was dismissed. However, in a second order of forfeiture, the constitutionality finding was affirmed, but the probable cause finding and forfeiture of the contraband seized was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of malice murder. His conviction was affirmed on appeal. In seeking relief, appellant claimed that his conviction and sentence were null and void because &quot;aforethought&quot; was an essential element of malice murder and the trial court's purported instruction to the jury that Georgia law did not require premeditation prohibited the jury from making a finding regarding the element of premeditation and relieved the State of its burden of proof with regard to that element. The trial court denied appellant's motion after finding that it failed to raise any discernable justiciable issue. Appellant then filed a direct appeal, invoking Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-9-4 in filing his motion in the trial court and in filing his notice of appeal. However, appellant did not question the trial court's personal or subject-matter jurisdiction. Rather, appellant raised an issue as to the content of a jury instruction given by the trial court in appellant's murder trial. Such an issue was an allegation that the criminal conviction was voidable, not an allegation that the conviction was void. Thus, appellant's motion was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

First, the verdicts were not mutually inconsistent. Even accepting that they were, the evidence was sufficient to support them. Second, jurors were not presumed to be pro-State merely by reciting the pledge of allegiance. Rather, a juror's willingness to recite the pledge, with its reinforcement of the concepts of liberty and justice for all, showed no bias for either side. In fact, such was more likely to remind a juror of his or her obligations in the pursuit of justice. Third, there was no abuse of discretion surrounding the jurors which were struck for cause, due to the inability to stand in judgment of another, a belief that the law was unequally applied, and for another's religious beliefs. Fourth, witnesses were properly qualified and accepted as experts. Fifth, a Jackson-Denno hearing was not required, as defendant's statement was introduced for purposes of impeachment. Finally, the indictment sufficiently informed defendant of the charge to allow her to prepare an intelligent defense.</SPAN></P>

The trial court (Georgia) denied mandamus, but declared that the developer had a vested right to complete the subdivision without complying with the flood ordinance, and ordered the issuance of building permits on that basis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer obtained various approvals in relation to his proposed development of a retirement community, including building permits for six houses. When the developer sought more building permits, they were refused. The developer was told that no more permits would be issued until the subdivision was in compliance with a flood ordinance as recently amended. On appeal, the supreme court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the matter since the appeal was one from a grant of mandamus. In addition, the supreme court concluded that unofficial approval of the developer's plans without regard to the restrictions of the flood ordinances would have frustrated the county's duty to its residents to enforce the law. On cross-appeal, the developer asserted that the trial court erred in rejecting its attacks on the validity of the floor ordinances. The developer argued that the ordinances were void based on the county's failure to give residents sufficient notice and an opportunity to be heard. The supreme court found evidence that other forms of notice other than publication were used and thus, the developer failed to bear its burden of showing the unconstitutionality of the ordinances.</SPAN></P>

The majority rule requiring the assignee, before resorting to publication of the required notice, to make reasonably diligent efforts beyond the use of tax and real estate records to ascertain the owner's address, was adopted. There was no evidence that the assignee tried to find the owner's address from any source other than tax and deed records, that other channels were not reasonably available, or that use of them would have been impractical, so it was not entitled to summary judgment.

The supreme court concluded that the ordinance, viewed as a whole, did not regulate according to zones or districts. The ordinance's limited references to zoning areas did not turn the ordinance into a zoning ordinance since the requirements applied to all land regardless of location. The associations also argued that the ordinance effected a regulatory taking of their property with just compensation. As the associations failed to show that they were deprived of all economically viable use of their land, the supreme court upheld the validity of the ordinance. Finally, the associations argued that the ordinance was pre-empted by O.C.G.A. &sect; 12-6-24, which related to commercial timber harvesting. The supreme court concluded that state law did not pre-empt the ordinance since the legislature made it clear that the &sect; 12-6-24 did not preclude counties from enacting and enforcing tree ordinances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from a trial court (Georgia), which denied his motion to dismiss an accusation that charged him with attempting to capture a principal on a bail bond without registering as a bail recovery agent with the local sheriff in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-6-58(a), and with criminal trespass.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A professional bail bondsman hired defendant to act as a bail recovery agent. In 2001, defendant was assigned to apprehend a principal on a bond issued by the bondsman. Defendant located the principal in a Fulton County apartment and kicked in the door to make an arrest. Defendant had been registered as a bail recovery agent in the county in 2000; however, his registration was not renewed for 2001. Subsequently, defendant was charged with violating O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-6-58(a). Defendant argued that &sect; 17-6-58(a) was unconstitutionally applied to him. The court agreed, holding that the county's failure to maintain a system for the registration of individual agents precluded a successful prosecution of defendant for violating &sect; 17-6-58(a). Also, defendant could not be held vicariously liable for the bondsman's alleged failure to register defendant in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-6-56(c). Because O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-6-58(a) did not make it a crime to fail to renew a registration, that provision did not provide defendant with fair notice that he could be held criminally responsible for acting as a bail recovery agent in the county if he failed to renew his registration in that county.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff cities had filed an action against defendant county, alleging claims for breach of contract and attorney fees, arising from an alleged failure by the county to properly disburse funds under HOST to the various cities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county voters approved a tax under HOST, and to facilitate the capital outlay requirement, the county entered into an intergovernmental agreement with several cities inside the county. However, the cities disputed the amount of money that the county was to disburse to them. Accordingly, the cities commenced their action against the county. The trial court granted the county's motion for judgment on the pleadings, holding that the agreement was void. The court of appeals affirmed that judgment, holding that HOST required that the county administer the tax funds and that it could not shift that responsibility to the cities pursuant to the agreement. On certiorari review, the court held that the court of appeals had relied on case precedent in error. The court concluded that HOST implemented a district tax under the &quot;special district&quot; provision of Ga. Const. art. IX, &sect; II, para. VI, which was not a &quot;county tax&quot; as described in the judicial precedent relied upon. Accordingly, distribution of the proceeds from the county to the cities was allowable.

The telecommunications company filed an action in the trial court to challenge the county's authority to enforce the ordinance and declare the ordinance unconstitutional. The trial court found that O.C.G.A. &sect; 32-4-42 gave the county the &quot;necessarily-implied authority&quot; to charge telecommunications companies a permit fee as a means of regulating a telecommunications company's installation of lines on the county's rights-of-way so long as the fee was reasonably related to the regulation. It then found the ordinance was a reasonable regulation because it involved an administrative cost recoupment fee for the cost in reviewing permit applications, as opposed to a tax intended to produce revenue for the county. On appeal, the state supreme court found that the permit fee was reasonably related to the regulation and the evidence showed that the telecommunications company's equal protection rights had not been violated by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court held that O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-13-31(e) did not violate equal protection of the laws because the statute contained no purity requirement, as was required for cocaine. The legislature was under no duty to treat all drugs and drug offenders the same. The mere fact that cocaine and methamphetamine were both listed as Schedule II controlled substances did not mean that the legislature had to enact identical statutes pertaining to those substances. The statute treated all those charged with methamphetamine trafficking equally. Defendant's detention and search at the police roadblock was not an unconstitutional search and seizure because the roadblocks were implemented as safety checkpoints based on a number of citizen complaints about drunken and reckless drivers in the area. It was unnecessary to determine whether the police had proper probable cause to search defendant's vehicle because he voluntarily consented to the search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. The appellate court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. The victim was found encased in concrete in a cattle trough on a farm defendant used for hunting. Defendant had purchased 10 80-pound bags of concrete and a cattle trough. Defendant's mailbox was painted the same as the trough, and the paint was found in defendant's home. However, defense counsel ineffectively represented defendant, as he used a peremptory strike to strike a juror who had been stricken for cause. Defendant was prejudiced by the unnecessary waste of a peremptory strike. The search warrant for defendant's home was supported by probable cause under the totality of the circumstances. Witnesses had observed defendant at the victim's home near the time he disappeared. The farm manager who located the victim's body told police that defendant used the farm for hunting. The victim had a tumultuous relationship with defendant. Because the search warrant for the house was proper, the evidence obtained from the truck was not tainted as &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction by the trial court (Georgia) for driving under the influence of cocaine, challenging the denial of his motion to suppress blood test results taken after an accident with his consent after he was read his rights under O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-55(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the implied consent provision allowed the State to require a person to consent to a search of his bodily substances without probable cause. The State's highest court held that the provision violated the Georgia and U.S. Constitutions. While special needs exceptions to the probable cause requirement had been recognized, the implied consent provision's purpose was primarily to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution. No matter how important that purpose might be, it did not create a special need to depart from the probable cause requirement. The implied consent provision compelled chemical testing merely due to involvement in a traffic accident resulting in serious injury or death, and did not require probable cause of impaired driving. Defendant was not under arrest when he was read the implied consent notice, and the trooper's sole basis for administering the blood test to him was because he believed that O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-55(a) mandated that he do so. The trooper did not find probable cause that defendant was driving in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-391, and defendant's consent was invalid. The blood test results should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed, by writ of certiorari, the affirmance by the Court of Appeals (Georgia) of the trial court's interpretation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-8-70 as prohibiting two defense attorneys from making the closing argument on his behalf.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the appellate court improperly overruled Limbrick v. State. The state's highest court agreed. O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-8-70 was construed under the substantive law in effect when the 1982 Code was enacted. Section 17-8-70 was construed such that the statutory limitation of one counsel &quot;heard in conclusion&quot; applied to the party exercising the privilege of the final jury argument chronologically. That construction harmonized all parts of the statute and gave a sensible and intelligent effect to each part of the statute. The first part of &sect; 17-8-70 provided that two attorneys could present argument on behalf of a party without leave of court. If the second part of the statute was construed as limiting the middle and concluding argument to one attorney, it rendered the first part meaningless. White v. Cline, 330 S.E.2d 386 (1985), and its progeny were overruled to the extent they limited the number of counsel who might present the middle argument. Ga. Unif. Super. Ct. R. 13.3 and the Uniform State Court Rules were to be similarly construed. It was error to limit the number of defense attorneys who could participate in the middle argument. The error was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an case certified for immediate review by the trial court, which was transferred by the Georgia Court of Appeals to the state's highest court, appellant husband appealed from the denial of his motion to dismiss, which had been treated as a motion for summary judgment, alleging that appellee wife's claim for damages for personal injuries arising from a motorcycle accident was barred by interspousal tort immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband argued that the interspousal tort immunity doctrine applied, even though one count of the wife's complaint requested a divorce. The supreme court held that the interlocutory appeal involved only a tort claim, and was not a divorce case within the meaning of Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; VI, para. III(6). Further, the wife failed to bring the matter within the constitutionality jurisdiction of the supreme court. In the interests of judicial economy, the supreme court ruled on the underlying claim. The Harris exception to application of the interspousal tort immunity doctrine was inapplicable. The wife knew about the alleged tort and the husband's role, but then extinguished her cause of action by marrying the husband. The wife did not point to any evidence which showed an extreme factual situation under Harris. The trial court erred in denying the husband's motion for summary judgment, as the husband was entitled to judgment based on the interspousal tort immunity doctrine. The doctrine, as codified in O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-3-8, did not violate the due process or equal protection provisions of the Georgia or U.S. Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for consideration of any constitutional questions properly raised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his conviction and appeal, appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that he was mentally retarded. The trial court granted the writ to the limited extent of ordering a jury trial on the question of mental retardation, using the &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; standard. On appeal, the court reversed, and on remand, the trial court found that appellant had not proved his mental retardation beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-131(a)(3). By supplemental order, the trial court denied appellant's remaining claims. Thereafter, the trial court allowed reconsideration and granted a writ on the mental retardation issue, with proof by appellant to be by a preponderance of the evidence. On appeal, the court held that Ring and Atkins did not require a jury trial on the mental retardation claim. Further, as it was originally waived at trial, the matter was only reviewable under a miscarriage of justice standard. The court found that many issues were procedurally defaulted, for which no cause and prejudice was shown, or they were barred by res judicata. Appellant failed to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

The Governor sought a writ of mandamus compelling the Attorney General to dismiss the appeal. The Georgia trial court denied the Governor's petition, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature passed a law reapportioning state senate districts. A federal district court declined to give the plan preclearance under &sect; 5 (42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1973c) of the Voting Rights Act; the Attorney General appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the legislature enacted a revised plan, 2002 Ga. Laws 149 (Act 444); the new districts would take effect only if the prior act was held to violate the Voting Rights Act. In denying the Governor relief, the trial court ruled that the Attorney General had exclusive authority to decide whether to continue the appeal. The state supreme court rejected the Attorney General's claim that the instant appeal became moot when the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the federal district court's judgment and remanded the case. First, that federal case was still pending; second, the issue was one of significant public concern, was capable of repetition, and had evaded review. Under the constitution and statutes, neither officer had the exclusive power to decide the State's interest in litigation. By declining to dismiss the appeal, the Attorney General was fulfilling a duty required by Act 444. Act 444 did not violate separation of powers principles.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Georgia trial court convicted defendant of rape, armed robbery, and murder and sentenced him to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the finding that he was not mentally retarded and could thus be executed. However, no error was found. Defendant committed prior crimes that required specific planning, intelligence, and logistics. Also, he attended school until about the ninth grade, and his school and juvenile records were devoid of any indication that authorities suspected he might be mentally retarded. The crime scene photographs showed the restraints defendant attempted to use on the murder victim and the ransacking of the house, due to his attempt to find and steal items of value. These photographs supported the State's version of the crime scene and illustrated the resourcefulness displayed by defendant to accomplish his criminal purposes. The given instructions properly informed the jury that a verdict of mental retardation would not result in the defendant's release from custody. The trial court did not err by refusing to charge the jury that a verdict of mental retardation would result in a life sentence. Finally, the procedure requiring defendant to prove his mental retardation by a preponderance of the evidence in a jury trial was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the Stephens County (Georgia) trial court with (1) murder, (2) felony murder, (3) aggravated assault, (4) possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and (5) possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress a custodial statement and sustained his demurrer to two counts of the indictment. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found defendant did not validly waive counsel when certain custodial statements were made. The supreme court held this was not clearly erroneous, as an officer encouraged defendant to speak after he invoked his right to counsel. Defendant's charge of possession of a firearm by a felon, on which a charge of felony murder was predicated, was based on defendant's Pennsylvania misdemeanor conviction for involuntary manslaughter, which carried a maximum five-year sentence. O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-11-131, criminalizing a felon's firearm possession, gave insufficient notice to defendant that his Pennsylvania misdemeanor could be a predicate felony for a charge under the statute.&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-11-131(a)'s definition of a felony created an ambiguity, in that a person of ordinary intelligence could fail to appreciate that the statute intended to encompass any offense with a maximum penalty over 12 months, even if it was called a misdemeanor. Had sufficient notice been given, the Full Faith and Credit clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, would not prohibit according defendant's misdemeanor conviction felony status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bill was enacted to allow the State Road and Tollway Authority (SRTA) to issue specific bonds to fund highway construction and to use future federal-aid highway funds to retire the bonds.

The state then petitioned to confirm and validate issuance of the specific bonds. The taxpayers argued that validation violated the Georgia Constitution. The trial court disagreed, and validated and approved the bonds. After the taxpayers appealed, the state supreme court found the joint resolution did not violate the certain-contracts-prohibited clause because the resolution was not a binding contract pledging the state's credit or imposing obligations on the state's treasury, did not violate the gratuities clause because the use of federal highway funds for the projects substantially benefited the state and its citizens, and did not violate the annual appropriations provision since a state authority could constitutionally receive federal-aid highway funds.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held this provision created an unconstitutional burden-shifting presumption, and a jury instruction stating the provision was not harmless, as evidence of defendant's guilt was not overwhelming. The unconstitutional provision was severable from the rest of the statute, and the evidence allowed defendant's retrial. The cards were discovered on defendant's person in a valid pat-down search. Defendant's cross-examination of the arresting officer was not unduly limited when defendant could not ask the officer if his testimony at a suppression hearing satisfied the requirements for a legal search. Defendant's requested instructions to the effect that the State had to show defendant deliberately withheld the cards from the victim were covered by other instructions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the trial court erred by forbidding voir dire questioning regarding their status as prison escapees and in charging the jury on certain statutory presumptions regarding venue. Because the issue of defendants' escape from prison was relevant to the subject matter of the State's prosecution, the supreme court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by prohibiting them from raising that issue during voir dire. After reviewing the transcript, however, the supreme court concluded that based on the overwhelming evidence of defendants' guilt, it was highly improbable that this error contributed to the jury's verdicts. Therefore, it was harmless. Defendants also argued that the trial court erred by giving the jury instructions regarding venue that improperly imposed a burden on them to disprove that venue was properly laid. The supreme court concluded the charge did not raise any improper burden-shifting presumptions regarding venue, though the court did note that the legislation from which the instructions came was poorly drafted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted an ordinance that placed a 1-year moratorium on the construction of electric power substations within 500 feet of residentially zoned property. A power company began construction on a substation that violated the ordinance, and the city issued a stop work order. On appeal, the city contended that O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-35-6(a)(5) did not apply, as the city's charter and O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-34-2(7) authorized the city to regulate the placement of substations. The supreme court held that the city's authority under &sect; 36-34-2(7) was limited to a utility's use of city property. The power company was not using city property. It was constructing the substation on its own property. Thus, neither the city charter nor &sect; 36-34-2(7) gave the city authority to regulate the subject substation. The city also contended that, as the Public Service Commission (PSC) did not have rules and regulations governing the placement of substations, such building was not part of the PSC's business activity, and was thus not within the express preemption of O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-35-6(a)(5).

The supreme court noted that both statutes prohibited the sale of fake illegal drugs. The supreme court agreed with the court of appeals that one of the ways a person could &quot;distribute,&quot; as that word was used in &sect; 16-13-30.2, was by selling the fake controlled substance. The supreme court found that using the same evidence, a reasonable trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's conduct violated either the felony or misdemeanor statute. Because the same conduct constituted both a felony and a misdemeanor, the rule of lenity required that defendant be subjected to the penalties for the misdemeanor, rather than the felony.</SPAN></P>

The Georgia trial court upheld the ordinance and statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county ordinance and state statute were constitutional, as Ga. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 6, para. 3 and O.C.G.A. 48-5-404(a) allowed the entity that collected school taxes up to a 2.5 percent commission. When examined on a statewide basis the commission was not an unreasonable rate of reimbursement. O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-5-404(a) did not violate Ga. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 6, para. 3, though the charge may have been more than the county's costs to collect school taxes. Because O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-5-404(a) did not limit the county's commission to the cost to collect the school taxes, the county ordinance that authorized the county to receive 2.5 percent did not violate the state statute. The caption of the 1994 legislation signed by the governor that amended the law at issue stated that it was an act to repeal certain obsolete and superseded laws and provisions of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated based upon classification by population. O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-5-404(b) was a provision based on classification by population, and, therefore, was related to and had a natural connection with the main object of the legislation that effected its repeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Atkinson County (Georgia) declared the statutory child support guidelines (Guidelines) under O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-6-15, to be unconstitutional, concluding they violated the constitutional guarantees of due process, equal protection and privacy, and also operated as an unconstitutional taking of property. Appellant, the Georgia Department of Human Resources, sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court held that while the Guidelines did distinguish between custodial and non-custodial parents, that distinction was required in order to ensure that the non-custodial parent contributed his or her fair share to ensure the welfare of the children was protected. Second, contrary to the trial court's conclusion, custodial and non-custodial parents were not similarly situated. The custodial parent contributed to the costs of caring for children, and had primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of a child, to ensure he or she received adequate financial resources from the non-custodial parent. Non-custodial parents had measurably less involvement in the day-to-day care of children, and depended on the Guidelines to ensure that their support obligations were not out of proportion to their income. Third, the trial court also erred by implying that the Guidelines affected only obligors and violated the constitutional right to privacy. Fourth, the Guidelines were not a governmental taking. Finally, there was no provision that an indigent had the right to free court reporter services in an appellate, civil proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The Grady County Superior Court (Georgia) entered judgment in favor of defendants on all counts of the complaint. The judge appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the request of the judge, the county entered into a contract with a private entity which provided probation services. The judge terminated the contract. The judge was directed to reinstate the contract, but failed to comply. The judge was terminated. On appeal, the judge claimed that O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-32-2(a)&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated the separation of powers doctrine because it authorized the city to control the court's day-to-day activities. The supreme court held that because the municipal court was a municipal office discharging strictly municipal functions, &sect; 36-32-2(a) did not violate the separation of powers doctrine of the Georgia Constitution. The judge also asserted that O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-8-100(f)(1), (g)(1) violated the separation of powers doctrine because they unconstitutionally allowed the executive to invade the province of the judiciary by requiring the governing authority's approval of the selection of a private probation service provider. Because the state court's selection of a probation services provider financially impacted the governing authority, it did not invade the province of the judiciary to attach such contract to the governing authority's approval.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Muscogee County Superior Court, Georgia, granted summary judgment to plaintiff taxpayers, and against the county government defendants, in the taxpayers' suit challenging the constitutionality of a local constitutional amendment affecting the ad valorem taxation of homestead property. The county government appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the Homestead Freeze local constitutional amendment (LCA) was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the uniformity in taxation clause of the Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; I, para. III (1983). However, this ruling failed to recognize that pre-existing LCAs which were not repealed were to be continued in force and effect. Thus, because the LCA was a subsequent amendment to the uniformity clause, and because the LCA continued in force and effect, the LCA was valid despite any conflict with the uniformity clause. The LCA was not unconstitutional under a rational relationship equal protection analysis because of classifications it drew among homeowners based upon purchase-date classification, or because of the separate classification of homeowners and renters. Further, the LCA did not violate the Equal Protection Clause just because racial minorities had less success than their white economic counterparts in obtaining the financing necessary to purchase homes. Finally, because there was no cut-off date or durational residence requirement in the LCA, there was no violation of the right to travel guaranteed by the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held, inter alia, that there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions and the sentence. The prospective jurors were properly seated. The trial court did not improperly restrict defendant's voir dire questions. There was no error in the excuse of four prospective jurors for cause. Disabled persons were not systematically excluded from the grand jury. There was no error with the jury charges. The victims' testimonies in the guilt-phase of the trial were not victim-impact evidence and were relevant. The prior difficulties between defendant and his wife and father-in-law were admissible to show bent of mind and motive. The State was not required to plead exceptions to the statute of limitations. Defendant was properly denied a lesser-related charge as to felony murder predicated on burglary. Any error in bias in the grand jury was harmless. The death sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor and was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court held that the charges were not transferred to the traffic violations bureau until after defendant's demand for a jury trial was filed. Thus, until the transfer, the case proceeded as a routine misdemeanor speeding offense and the right to jury trial attached when defendant filed his timely written demand. As a result, the provision of &sect; 15-13-60 that limited defendant's right to a jury trial violated Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. XI.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner placed her mobile home on her property, in violation of a city ordinance that specifically excluded mobile homes from R-2 districts. The city filed suit and after an initial reversal on a procedural ground, the trial court held that the zoning ordinance was constitutional and was not preempted by the National Manufactured Housing and Safety Standards Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 5401-5426. On appeal, the court agreed that the city's ordinance was not preempted by federal law and was constitutional. The court held that the ordinance was not preempted by the Act because the city had not infringed on the federal government's control over safety and construction standards for mobile homes. The testimony of a city official that a mobile home that met building codes could be placed in R-2 districts was in conflict with the ordinance and unsupported. As to the constitutionality argument, the evidence showed that the city's purpose in restricting mobile home placement was to regulate the quality of housing stock and promote general safety concerns.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, appellant city appealed from a judgment by the Fulton County Superior Court (Georgia) granting summary judgment to appellee class of attorneys who had paid the tax but who claimed that the city's occupation tax was unconstitutional. The city also appealed from declaratory relief granted to appellee attorney, who did not pay the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class of attorneys and the attorney contended that the tax unconstitutionally required payment of the tax before practicing law and created the possibility of incarceration of lawyers who engaged in the practice of law but refused to pay the tax. The appellate court held that the statute was unconstitutional. Payment of the tax was a precondition to the practice of law, and incarceration for practicing law without payment of the tax would impede the practice of law whether that incarceration was directly for practicing while delinquent or indirectly for that conduct by means of a contempt citation. The requirement that the tax be paid prior to practicing law could not be severed without radically rewriting the ordinance. Overruling Henderson v. Carter, 195 S.E.2d 4 (1972), the appellate court held that O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-5-380(c) did not preclude bringing a class action for the refund of the taxes. The holding was applied retroactively, as the financial hardship to the city by a retrospective application did not alone justify prospective application. The city erroneously contended that the trial court held that the statute of limitations was tolled for the class of attorneys.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court granted defendant's interlocutory application to consider whether he was entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard on the State's request for a search warrant to obtain his personal medical records. Because a search warrant required a neutral judicial officer to find probable cause that a crime has been committed, defendant's constitutional right to privacy was not violated when the State obtained private medical records through a search warrant without notice to defendant or a hearing on the request. Requiring pre-seizure notice and a hearing would undermine the use of search warrants in criminal investigations; it could also affect prosecutions involving other crimes and records held by third parties. The State narrowly drafted the search warrant to seek only the medical records related to the hospital's treatment of defendant on the night of his accident, and the trial court found the search warrant affidavit was legally sufficient to establish probable cause. Since the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed, the State complied with all the established procedures in obtaining the search warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electric corporation distributed and transmitted electric power pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 46-3-170. It was comprised of 39 affiliated electric membership corporations and was authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain pursuant to O.G.G.A. &sect; 46-3-201(b)(9). It began planning construction of a 115-kilovolt transmission line to service the electrical demands of the certain customers of an affiliated electric membership corporation that served the county. The electric corporation selected a particular route which crossed approximately seven miles of the county, as the site for the proposed transmission line. The county subsequently adopted a high voltage line construction moratorium ordinance. It was undisputed that the electric corporation would have to condemn property in order to effectuate the project as proposed, and that the ordinance would halt the project. The appellate court held there was simply no requirement that the electric corporation demonstrate to the county the necessity or the appropriateness of its proposed project.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sentence Review Panel reduced a sentence imposed by appellant judge. The judge then found that the Panel lacked statutory authority and that O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-6 was unconstitutional. Appellees attorney general and others sought a writ of prohibition against enforcement of the order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge asserted that prohibition was not an available remedy. The state's highest court concluded that appellees were authorized to petition for a writ of prohibition on the ground that the judge lacked jurisdiction to address the constitutionality of the Panel in the context of the criminal case. The sentences that the judge initially imposed were not void and were affirmed. Under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-6(d), the judge's subject matter jurisdiction was strictly limited to determining whether the sentences for which the individual sought review were among those that the Panel was statutorily authorized to reduce. The Panel did not have jurisdiction to consider the request for a reduction in such a sentence. Thus, the judge correctly held that the Panel lacked the statutory authority to reduce the 10-year sentence. In the context of the criminal case, however, &sect; 17-10- 6(d) foreclosed the judge's exercise of subject matter jurisdiction over the issue of the underlying constitutionality of the statute. Therefore, the trial court correctly granted a writ of prohibition as to that portion of the judge's order holding &sect; 17-10-6&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

A habeas court found that a genuine issue of fact existed regarding mental retardation, but, after petitioner asked for dismissal, the trial court (Georgia) found a waiver of the right to such a trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the jury trial on petitioner's mental retardation, petitioner wrote a letter to the trial court asking for dismissal of the proceeding. The trial court held a hearing during which petitioner stated that he was not mentally retarded. The trial court found that petitioner knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial on the issue. The next month, with new counsel, petitioner sought to set aside the dismissal and withdraw his waiver. Before the court ruled on the motion, however, petitioner again wrote a letter asking for dismissal of the mental retardation trial. The trial court again found a waiver of the right to a trial on mental retardation. The appellate court held that, as petitioner's trial for a capital crime was prior to July 1, 1988, once the habeas corpus court found a genuine issue regarding his mental retardation, the issue had to be thoroughly reviewed and passed upon and was no longer subject to waiver. Contrary to the State's contention, the trial court was not authorized to resolve the matter by finding that petitioner was not mentally retarded; the issue had to be decided by a jury using the definition of retardation in O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-131.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings, including a jury trial on the issue of mental retardation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld the statute. After that ruling was entered, the state supreme court agreed with the trial court and found that the statute violated neither substantive due process nor equal protection principles. In regard to substantive due process, the state supreme court noted that the statute did not impact on a fundamental right, especially as the right to privacy was not implicated. Accordingly, the state supreme court found the statute was not required to pass a strict scrutiny case in order to be constitutional. The state supreme court also found that, as organ donors were not members of a suspect class, the statute for equal protection purposes only had to pass a rational basis test, which it did.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who beat the victim severely with a rock around the head and face, argued, inter alia, that the malice murder statute was unconstitutional because it failed to give notice that the offense can be committed by assaulting a person with a large rock. The instant court concluded that because defendant failed to raise this issue in a timely manner, it was waived. Defendant's remaining enumerations of error had no merit. There was ample evidence showing that defendant was competent to stand trial. Error in preventing a licensed clinical social worker from testifying as an expert regarding opinions formed during her evaluation of defendant was harmless. The social worker was prepared to testify that she made a provisional diagnosis of paranoid-type schizophrenia. The instant court noted that the expert's testimony would have been cumulative of a psychiatrist called by defendant. Regarding defendant's contention that it was error to compel a defense expert to produce a written report for the State, the instant court found no reversible error. The failure to preserve a panel board on which the victim was found did not constitute a denial of due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Pike County Superior Court (Georgia) of malice murder, felony murder, kidnapping with bodily injury, armed robbery, and aggravated battery. The trial court treated the felony murder verdict as vacated by operation of law, imposed a death sentence for the murder, consecutive terms of life imprisonment for the kidnapping and armed robbery, and 20 years for the aggravated battery. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed the victim of her bank cards, cut her throat, stabbed her repeatedly, pursued her as she fled, held her until she weakened, and then dragged her away while she was still alive. He was caught while trying to obtain cash from an automated teller machine. The murder weapons were recovered from his car, and he confessed. The supreme court held the evidence was sufficient to convict. As his conviction on the aggravated battery count, which alleged he cut the victim's throat, merged with his malice murder conviction, the former conviction was vacated. All other claimed errors were either not error, had not been preserved, or were harmless. O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 16-5-40 and 16-8-41 (kidnapping and armed robbery) were not unconstitutionally vague. The kidnapping count of the indictment placed defendant on sufficient notice of the charges against him. The State's asking jurors to imagine themselves in the victim's place was error, but was unlikely to have affected the verdict. The evidence sufficed to establish the statutory aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. The death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence for aggravated battery were vacated, and the other convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Veteran Affairs guardian petitioned the Fulton County Probate Court (Georgia) for a declaratory judgment that O.C.G.A. &sect; 29-6-11(c), which prohibited the guardian from being a beneficiary under his ward's will, was unconstitutional. The trial court found the statute constitutional, and the guardian appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) required a guardian for the ward to receive DVA benefits. The supreme court held the guardian timely appealed as he did not have to appeal the implicit disqualification of his taking of the ward's bequest, which was beyond the trial court's jurisdiction in a proceeding to probate the will. The probate court could issue a declaratory judgment. The guardian was clearly a DVA guardian. The probate court's erroneous letters of &quot;general&quot; guardianship instead of DVA guardianship were corrected, and the guardian was appointed under the procedures for appointment of a DVA guardian.  O.C.G.A. &sect; 29-6-11(c), preventing the guardian's taking under the ward's will, did not violate Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; V, para. III, prohibiting a bill containing matter different from its title, because it related to the bill's stated purpose of changing DVA guardianships. The statute did not violate the equal protection clauses of the U.S. or Georgia constitutions as it was rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in regulating DVA guardianships. The statute was not limited to the guardian's taking, as a beneficiary, of the ward's DVA benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, after his third trial, appealed from his conviction in the Walton County Superior Court (Georgia) of malice murder and 10 counts of forgery. The jury recommended, and the trial court imposed, a death sentence for the murder conviction based on three aggravating circumstances. The trial court denied defendant's motion for new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the trial court gave the jury an improper charge on using a deadly weapon, this error did not require reversal given the overwhelming evidence of malice. Defendant was permitted to ask sufficient questions on voir dire. Double jeopardy did not bar the death penalty, although a jury had deadlocked in an earlier trial, since the first jury had not adjudicated defendant's sentence or his guilt. The death penalty was not a disproportionate sentence. The State's failure to list the statutory aggravators in the indictment did not violate defendant's constitutional rights. Defendant was put on notice that the State was seeking the death penalty and of the statutory aggravators. The district attorney had the discretion to decide whether defendant met the criteria for the death penalty and whether to pursue it. It was not an abuse of discretion to limit the cross-examination of the State's witness. The transfer of venue was within the trial court's discretion. Georgia's statutory death penalty scheme was constitutional. The appellate court properly reviewed death sentences for proportionality. There were several aggravating factors supporting defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised several claims of error on appeal. The appeals court held that the superior court properly exercised jurisdiction over the case, evidence was sufficient to support the verdicts, the court did not abuse its discretion in ruling on the eligibility of prospective jurors, and there was no prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments. Specifically, causing brain loss fit the statutory definition of aggravated battery. The jury could find defendant guilty of aggravated assault, as the victim appeared frightened as he exited the bus, was aware that defendant was following him, and had been threatened with physical harm before. Although hands and feet were not deadly weapons per se, the jury could find them to be so depending upon their use. Media coverage did not prevent a fair trial and did not mandate a change of venue. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying motions to strike various jurors for cause. Finally, there were two independent underlying felony convictions that sustained the felony murder conviction. Thus, the felony murder conviction was not deficient for being predicated upon multiple felonies without specification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant resident sought a declaratory judgment that a de facto &quot;family court&quot; established by appellee judge and others was illegal and unconstitutional. The Georgia trial court dismissed the claims for attorney fees, costs, and punitive damages. The claims for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief were dismissed after the trial court found they failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The resident appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family court was established by a standing order issued pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-9.1(b)(2)(D). Since judges were immune from liability in civil actions for acts performed in their judicial capacity, the trial court did not err when it dismissed that portion of the complaint seeking damages from the judge. The supreme court found there was no appellate decision that controlled the resident's contentions that the judge was without constitutional authority to create a family court because a &quot;family court&quot; was not contained in the Georgia Constitution's listing of the courts in which the judicial power of the state was vested exclusively, and that the standing order resulted in the unconstitutional judicial creation and/or modification of courts and judgeships. However, because the judge did not show that there was an absence of law to support the resident's claims, the trial court erred in dismissing the petition for declaratory and injunctive relief for failure to state a claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That portion of the trial court's judgment dismissing the petition for declaratory and injunctive relief was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court for consideration of those issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an expedited appeal, appellant, the Georgia Secretary of State, appealed from an order by the Fulton County Superior Court (Georgia) ordering her to place appellee, a candidate, on the primary ballot for the district four seat on the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC), contending that the one-year residency requirement in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 46-2-1(b) was constitutional as applied to the candidate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The districts had been reapportioned, causing the candidate to fail the residency requirement.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 46-2-1(b) required a candidate for the PSC to be a resident of the territory within the district for 12 months prior to the general election. The Georgia Constitution did not create an exception to the one-year residency requirement due to reapportionment of the district. The candidate admitted that he was a resident of Jackson County, which was now in district two, one year before the general election, and did not attempt to become a resident of Banks County in district four until 10 months before the general election. The residency requirement for the PSC was rationally related to the state's legitimate interests in fostering informed voters and promoting knowledgeable and responsive candidates with ties to the community. The requirement did not place an unreasonable burden on the right of voters to choose a candidate or the right of the candidate to run for public office. Requiring the candidate to reside in the district for 12 months prior to the general election did not deny him equal protection under the United States Constitution or the Georgia Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's tests showed alcohol concentrations over the legal limit. Defendant moved to suppress the results. He alleged the implied consent warning in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-5-67.1 violated the state and federal constitutions' Equal Protection Clause. He argued boaters and hunters, under other statutes, were informed their test results could be used against them at trial, but Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-5-67.1 did not so advise a motorist. He also contended the breathalyzer machine was not operating properly and the evidence was insufficient. After the motions were denied and he was convicted, the state supreme court found the implied consent warning statute was constitutional since defendant was not similarly situated to boaters and hunters. It also found the State proved both the breathalyzer machine worked properly and he had a sufficient alcohol concentration to be convicted.</SPAN></P>

Applying the rational basis test, the Act bore a rational relation to the State's objective, insuring that amusement machines were not used for illegal cash payouts. Furthermore, the new law did not take business property for a public use; it merely required an already regulated business to adjust its property to the new law.</SPAN></P>

The city's ordinance violated the Joint County and Municipal Sales and Use Tax Act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-8-66 et seq., by authorizing the city to use the city's pro rata share of revenue generated by a county's local option sales tax (LOST) to roll back the millage rate for the city's county residents. The plain language of the act limited the application of the rollback provision in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-8-91 to those residents of the special district where the tax was imposed. Under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-8-91(a), the city had to uniformly compute the millage rate applicable to all residents necessary to produce revenue sufficient to defray its annual expenses.

Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-391(a)(6) violation, was not a per se violation since impaired driving ability was an element of the crime that had to be proven to obtain a conviction. One accused of violating (a)(2) did not suffer disparate treatment because &quot;less safe to drive&quot; and &quot;rendered incapable of driving safely&quot; were equivalent standards. One was driving under the influence when the ingestion of an intoxicant made one unable to drive as safely as one would have had he/she not ingested.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving his pickup at approximately 98 miles per hour when he was clocked by the deputy sheriff. During pursuit, the deputy activated a video camera in his car. The deputy stopped his patrol car about 20 feet behind defendant's truck. A conversation ensued. Defendant went back to his truck, obtained a gun, and shot the deputy several times. The appellate court found that the evidence was sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact to find proof of defendant's guilt of malice murder beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence; a search warrant to obtain defendant's blood sample was proper and based on probable cause. During jury selection, the appellate court found no Batson violation, as the State gave reasons for its strikes, rendering a preliminary showing of prima facie discrimination moot. The trial court did not err by denying defendant's motions for mistrial. The prosecutor's arguments were not improper, and if they were, they were corrected by a curative instruction. The appellate court also did not find error in the sentencing phase of the trial.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found defendant's challenge to the indictment for his vacated felony murder conviction was moot, but the indictment sufficiently pled the statute. The prosecution had a race-neutral reason for a challenged peremptory strike. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding a prospective juror whose friend was murdered would be impartial. The prosecutor's improper comment on defendant's silence was harmless, given a finding that the comment did not urge a negative inference, the strength of the evidence, the jury charge, and the comment's context. Police properly arrested defendant at his girlfriend's apartment, without a warrant, as she consented to their presence. Defendant's motion to suppress his statement was properly denied as he did not prove police said it could not be used against him. The trial judge's remarks overruling an objection to defendant's psychiatrist, at sentencing, did not comment on the evidence. The evidence allowed a rational trier of fact to find statutory aggravating circumstances supporting a death penalty, and the penalty was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Dougherty County Superior Court, Georgia, granted appellant doctor's motion for summary judgment regarding appellant patient's medical malpractice action against the doctor, on the ground that the two-year statute of limitation applicable barred the action. The Georgia Court of Appeals adopted the continuous treatment doctrine and reversed the trial court's judgment. The doctor sought a writ of certiorari which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient alleged that the doctor failed to diagnose dislocated bones in her left foot. The appellate court reversed the trial court's order on the ground that there was question of fact as to whether the doctor had treated the patient in the two years preceding the filing of her lawsuit. The main issue before the supreme court was whether the appellate court correctly adopted the doctrine of continuous treatment in medical malpractice cases involving misdiagnosis, thus deeming the negligent act to continue as long as the patient remains under the physician's care for the particular disease or condition, for purposes of the applicable statute of limitation. The supreme court held that the legislatively-prescribed statute of limitation did not provide for the commencement of the period of limitation upon the termination of the health-care provider's treatment of the patient, and the judicial branch was not empowered to engraft such a provision on to what the legislature had enacted. Thus, the appellate court's adoption of the continuous treatment doctrine was an error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature adopted a statutory scheme permitting owners of outdoor advertising to trim vegetation on public property blocking the viewing of their advertising. The supreme court held this scheme, Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 32-6-75.1 to 75.3, did not violate Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; 6, para. 6, prohibiting legislative donations. The legislature declared that outdoor advertising benefited the state. The statutory provisions required private individuals who benefited financially from the removal of trees on public property to pay for the privilege of enabling the public to view their signs unimpeded by trees and other natural obstructions. This did not amount to an illegal legislative gift.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 32-6-75.1 required the review of standards and policies regarding trimming and removing vegetation on state rights-of-way by the Roadside Enhancement and Beautification Council, prior to their enactment, and regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation without awaiting the appointment of that council were invalid for failing to comply with this statutory mandate.</SPAN></P>

Prior problems between defendant and the victims were properly admitted. Probable cause existed for issuing search warrants. Defendant's &quot;continuing witness&quot; objection could not apply to demonstrative evidence. It was no error for the trial court to ask witnesses questions from jurors. The jury's aggravating circumstance finding, that one victim's murder was committed during the other victim's murder, was set aside due to the rule against mutually supporting aggravating circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the loan was a valid exercise of the city's temporary borrowing power under the Georgia Constitution, and that the tax anticipation note executed as security for the loan was valid on its face and an enforceable obligation.

None of the enumerated limitations on the constitutional authority of a municipality to engage in temporary borrowing precluded the city from executing the tax anticipation note as security for the loan from the bank. Based upon the city's representations, the short-term loan from the bank was a valid exercise of the city's temporary borrowing powers. Prior to making the loan, the bank required the city to certify that all of the legal requirements for a temporary loan were satisfied. Moreover, the city certified to the bank that the money borrowed would be used for proper purposes.

The advertiser appealed to the board of zoning appeals, which affirmed. A Georgia superior county granted summary judgment in favor of the county as to all claims, and the advertiser appealed. The supreme court granted the advertiser's motion for reconsideration of its earlier opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The advertiser contended that summary judgment was erroneous because the sign ordinance conflicted with Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 32-6-83 and was, therefore, void and unenforceable under Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; VI, par. IV(a). The sign ordinance made no provision for compensating the owners of off-premises signs whose permits were revoked. The county urged that the supreme court could not address the constitutionality of its ordinance because the advertiser failed to raise that question before the zoning board. The board could not adjudicate a constitutional claim, and could only act legislatively, so the advertiser met the applicable non-judicial standard in announcing a challenge to the constitutionality on numerous occasions. The county effectuated a removal of the sign without paying the compensation mandated by state law. Under the circumstances, application of the ordinance violated the state constitution. The county could not rely upon an admittedly unconstitutional ordinance in defense of its appeal. The county had no vested right in enforcement of its ordinances which conflicted with Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 32-6-83 and which was, therefore, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The officers and the corporations failed to submit evidence in support of their motion to dissolve the TRO and the receivership. The supreme court held that the bankrupt corporations' appeal rested within the exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and was subject to the mandatory automatic stay provisions of 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 362. The supreme court also held that the officers' appeal in their individual capacity was moot because it sought to determine an issue which did not have any practical effect on the underlying controversy. The officers' complaint that the receivership and the TRO should be dissolved was moot because such dissolution had occurred when the state's action under the RICO Act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-14-1 et seq., had been dismissed more than six months prior to the appeal. It was undisputed that the receivership no longer existed and held no assets belonging to the officers in their individual capacity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence was sufficient to find defendant was guilty on all charges. Defendant contended that certain comments during the State's opening statement and certain testimony during the guilt/innocence phase of the trial improperly raised the worth of the victims and the impact wrought by their deaths. The supreme court concluded that the trial court erred in allowing the comments and testimony in question, but that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Also, the trial court permitted sufficient voir dire of the jurors on the subject of their death penalty views. Furthermore, the evidence was sufficient to find the existence of the statutory aggravating circumstances supporting the death sentences in defendant's case. Considering both the crimes and the defendant, the supreme court concluded that the death sentences imposed for the murders were neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases in Georgia. Finally, the supreme court concluded that the death sentences were not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax sale took place in 1995. The successor in title received quitclaim deeds from the record title holders in 1996 and brought an unsuccessful suit to cancel the tax deed that same year. The successor in title brought the instant suit in 1999 and paid into the trial court registry what it contended was the amount payable for redemption. The trial court found that the 1996 action did not bar the 1999 suit and that the tax deed holder had waived the requirement of tender by refusing to communicate with the successor in title. However, the trial court also found that the amount paid into the trial court registry was insufficient and that the title conveyed by the tax deed had ripened by prescription. The appellate court found that the tax deed holder did not have prescriptive title, as she had done nothing more than pay taxes on the property. The trial court correctly determined that the tax deed holder waived tender and that the amount paid into the registry was insufficient for redemption. However, insufficiency of payment did not prevent the successor in title from redeeming the property where it stood ready, willing, and able to pay the redemption price.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed to the extent that the trial court found that the suit was not barred and that tender had been waived, but the judgment was reversed to the extent that the trial court held that the successor in title was not allowed to redeem the property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the juvenile argued the delinquency petition failed to set out a specific violation of Georgia law in that the fornication statute underlying the petition was an unconstitutional violation of a citizen's liberty of privacy. She further asserted that it was unconstitutional to use as the offense underlying a petition for delinquency an act that would be protected activity if committed by an adult. The appellate court initially noted the right of privacy was not absolute since its successful exercise was dependent upon the facts and circumstances from which its assertion arose. The appellate court held the right of privacy did not protect all sexual conduct from prosecution. The appellate court concluded because the right of privacy was dependent upon the facts of each case, to the point they had been developed, the juvenile's case neither supported the successful assertion of the right to privacy nor served as the basis for quashing the petition alleging delinquency and unruliness on her part.</SPAN></P>

Unlike litigants who were not incarcerated, pro se prisoners could not monitor the processing of their appellate filings to ensure that the clerk of the court timely received them. They could not personally travel to the courthouse to see that their filings were filed timely, and could not regularly call the clerk of court to monitor whether their filings were received. Of course, being pro se, they could not rely on their lawyer to ensure the safe and timely filing of their appeals. Pro se prisoners also had to entrust their legal papers to the prison officials.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving a pickup truck that collided with an automobile. The other driver's mother was seated in the front passenger seat of the automobile. Injuries to the driver's mother were the basis of the charge of serious injury by vehicle. On appeal, defendant contended that the serious injury by vehicle statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-394, was unconstitutional as applied to him. Under the facts of the case, the proscription against seriously disfiguring a bodily member was not applied in an unconstitutional manner. The driver's mother suffered two broken legs just above the knees; both were shattered into dozens of pieces. Given the nature of the driver's mother's injuries, the prohibition against causing bodily harm to another by seriously disfiguring his body gave defendant due notice that it prohibited the acts for which he has been convicted. Despite defendant's argument to the contrary, the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fulton County Superior Court (Georgia), held that defendant, sentenced to death for four murders, could not be executed by electrocution as this method of execution was unconstitutional. The Monroe County Superior Court (Georgia), where a second defendant had been sentenced to death for murder and rape, held that his execution by electrocution was constitutional. The cases were consolidated for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court which held that execution by electrocution was constitutional received evidence from state and defense experts, autopsy reports, statements of electrocution survivors, and post-mortem photos of executed persons. In the other lower court, only defendant put on such evidence, some of which was objected to by the State. As this evidence was cumulative, the instant court considered only evidence received by the first court. This evidence showed that two or more applications of current were sometimes needed to kill the prisoner, electrocution could cause pain and horror, electrocution burned and blistered the body, and destroyed the brain by cooking it. The instant court held that death by electrocution inflicted purposeless physical violence and needless mutilation, and violated the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. XV. The legislature's adoption of lethal injection provided a less painful, less barbarous means of execution. Death sentences that formerly would have been executed by electrocution were not void, but future executions were to be carried out by lethal injection under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-38.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that upheld the constitutionality of execution by electrocution was reversed. The judgment that held execution by electrocution to be unconstitutional was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that, as citizens of Georgia, they had standing to seek enforcement of appellees' duty to obey the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The existence of standing under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-6-24 depended upon whether appellees owed a public duty which appellants, as members of the public, were entitled to have enforced. Contrary to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-6-24, appellants sought to prevent, rather than to enforce, the performance of a public duty. Appellants' challenge was to the very constitutionality of the underlying enactment pursuant to which appellees were compelled to perform their obligation of carrying out all lawfully imposed criminal sentences. The Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the comparable Georgia constitutional provision were not intended to benefit the public at large. Appellants were not directly adversely affected by the enforcement of the statute, because they were not charged with or convicted of a capital crime. Because appellants raised a political challenge and sought to block the performance of a public duty, the trial court properly dismissed the mandamus petition for lack of standing.</SPAN></P>

At trial, his motion that the trial court personally determine all excusals from jury service and provide defendant notice and an opportunity to be heard was granted. The clerk excused 49 of 160 potential jurors without notice. The trial court was authorized to excuse potential jurors based on a determination that jury service would pose an undue hardship, but the lack of inquiry into proffered medical excuses meant there was no determination of undue hardship and abused discretion; this error affecting the jury array composition required a new trial. The lack of a written order authorizing the clerk to excuse jurors and providing guidelines also abused discretion. The trial court did not have to give a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter since evidence of a sudden, violent, and irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation was lacking. Forced balancing to ensure the racial balance in a grand or traverse jury pool reflected the racial balance in the county population and was not unconstitutional. The victim's prior statement was not shown to be admissible under the necessity exception to the hearsay rule.</SPAN></P>

The guardian sought to impose civil liability pursuant to the Rape Confidentiality Statute. However, where a newspaper published truthful information which it lawfully obtained, punishment could only be imposed, if at all, when narrowly tailored to a state interest of the highest order. The State failed to utilize a more limited means of guarding against dissemination of the child's identity, the statute promulgated the self-censorship concerns, it had the same broad negligence per se standard found objectionable, and suffered from the same underinclusiveness as an earlier case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff did not let the bondsman write bail bonds in the county, giving no reasons, but later raising the bondsman's arrest for impersonating a police officer, a charge later dropped, and the bondsman filming a commercial at the jail, stating this violated Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-6-52, prohibiting a bondsman from soliciting business at a jail. Section 17-6-52, a criminal statute, had to be strictly construed in the bondsman's favor, and did not apply to a solicitation of the general public filmed at a jail, since the bondsman's presence there was not to solicit potential clients currently incarcerated, so the commercial did not support the sheriff's decision. The bondsman's arrest, even though charges were later dropped, allowed the sheriff to find the bondsman was not of &quot;good moral character,&quot; under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-6-50(3), and was a valid basis for his decision. The phrase &quot;good moral character&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague, and the argument was not raised in the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had amended its municipal code to provide that private companies providing security services at an adult entertainment establishment were required to have a city-issued permit of eligibility to provide those services and to register with the board of private detective and security agencies. The security company successfully challenged the ordinance, arguing by expressly authorizing additional local regulation of the security business, the Georgia Private Detective and Security Agencies Act impliedly preempted the city's regulation of those services in its adult entertainment establishments. The appellate court held under Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; 4(a) (1983), no special law could be enacted in any case for which provision had been made by an existing general law. The appellate court concluded because the city sought to establish a duplicate regulatory system which was not authorized by the comprehensive general law applicable to those engaged in the private security business, the trial court was correct that the general act preempted by implication the city's enforcement of Atlanta, Ga., Code &sect; 10-206(a) (1999) against the security company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial evidence showed that defendant and a co-perpetrator burglarized a home, fled, and returned to burglarize again. An 11 year-old male resident arrived and armed himself with a bat. Defendant and the co-perpetrator subdued him, the co-perpetrator non-fatally wounded the boy, defendant seated and shot twice a female resident who arrived, and the co-perpetrator repeatedly shot the boy. Defendant shot the owner when he arrived, and the co-perpetrator shot the children again. Defendant admitted to police that he shot the girl and led them to secreted weapons and other items. Two men who lived with defendant testified to defendant's and the co-perpetrator's admissions. The Georgia Supreme Court held that the trial court did not err by failing to excuse sua sponte 12 contested prospective jurors who were not challenged for cause based on their death penalty views. The rule against mutually-supporting aggravators was not violated. Admission of juvenile confessions of defendant at sentencing was not error. Defendant's attack of a jail guard while awaiting trial was relevant in proportionality review, as was his co-defendant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 16-12-1(b)(3) was unconstitutionally vague because the definition of &quot;deprived child&quot; contained in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 15-11-2, and incorporated in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-12-1(b)(3), failed to give adequate notice of the prohibited conduct. The supreme court disagreed. Measured by common understanding, the statute prohibited a person from willfully committing an act or omission that deprived a child of the physical, mental, emotional, or moral needs essential to the child's well-being. It was of no consequence that the definition of &quot;deprived child,&quot; like other provisions of the code relating to juvenile proceedings, had to be liberally construed. Even strictly construed, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-12-1(b)(3) provided sufficient warning to a person of ordinary intelligence that leaving the three-year-old victim alone with a third party who had previously beaten the child and was under the influence of methamphetamine, and then locking the child in a bathroom instead of promptly seeking medical attention after the third party had inflicted multiple skull fractures on her was prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's death sentence for murder was vacated during federal habeas corpus proceedings. The Cobb County Superior Court, Georgia, held a re-sentencing trial, the jury recommended death after finding the murder was committed in a kidnapping with bodily injury and that it was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture and depravity of mind.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-30(b)(2), (7). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant led police to the body of a missing girl and confessed. Search of his bedroom uncovered a handgun and pornography depicting young girls. Evidence at trial showed he stalked elementary school children; planned his crimes; abducted the eight-year-old victim as she was walking home from school; taped her mouth shut; threatened to kill her; took her to a remote area; made her strip naked; forced her to watch as he raped and forced other sex acts on her friend; chased her as she tried to escape; and held her head underwater where she struggled for several minutes before dying. He was resentenced to die. The Georgia Supreme Court held that the trial court had properly found that Cobb County had promulgated a rule which was not repealed requiring only five jury commissioners, which Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 15-12-20(c) permitted. The trial court handling of the venire in regard to its members' death or life-sentencing abilities was proper. Defendant's mother had consented to the search. The State's use of a pedophile-type book at trial, which defendant had ordered in prison, was proper. The prosecutor showed psychological abuse of the victim without making a &quot;golden rule&quot; argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions because the evidence was entirely circumstantial. Extensive trial testimony from medical personnel established that the victim had been abused prior to the fall and that the fall itself could cause injuries of such magnitude only if she had been thrown down the stairs. The jury was authorized to conclude it was not the first time the victim had been left in defendant's care and suffered a serious injury. Defendant contended the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of the victim's sister, who was four years old. A child was not incompetent as a matter of law because of her infancy. The sister's statements were admissible as prior inconsistent statements. The sister answered numerous questions regarding herself and the crime. The sister was available for cross-examination, and defendant was free to question her at trial regarding the reasons for her forgetfulness, confusion, and evasion. There was no reasonable possibility that the jury would have returned a different verdict had the trial court not allowed the sister's testimony. Trial counsel was not ineffective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of Roswell enacted a temporary moratorium on applications for billboard signs after its sign ordinance was struck down as unconstitutional. Appellee billboard company filed four applications to construct billboard signs. When the city failed to approve them, the billboard company filed a petition for mandamus, which the trial court granted. On appeal, the court held that the city's temporary moratorium on billboard sign applications was not a final legislative action, but a brief ban on applications lasting approximately one month. It did not permanently suspend all applications or prohibit them. It was merely enacted as an emergency measure to preserve the status quo for 30 days pending its enactment of a new ordinance. It was a reasonable interim action and therefore exempt from the procedural requirements of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 36-66-4. Because the city did not have to comply with the statute's notice requirements in briefly suspending its acceptance of applications for large billboard signs, the moratorium was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city did not reissue an alcoholic beverage license to the restaurant because the restaurant was located within 600 feet of another location already holding an alcohol license, &sect; 3-5(d), and the restaurant did not meet the criteria for a restaurant, &sect; 3-1(f). After a hearing, the city counsel denied the license because the restaurant did not meet the &sect; 3-1(f) definition of a restaurant. The trial court found &sect; 3-5(d) was unconstitutional because similarly situated businesses were exempt from the distance requirement and &sect; 3-1(f) was unconstitutionally applied. On appeal, the supreme court found the issues were properly before the court on applications for discretionary appeal. Further, the distance requirement of &sect; 3-5(d) was constitutional. Finally, the 600-foot exemption for establishments in the area where the restaurant was located bore a rational relationship to a legitimate government concern, and did not constitute a denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile had no due process right to a jury trial, since an adjudication of delinquency was not equivalent to conviction of a crime, the primary function of the delinquency laws was treatment and rehabilitation, and adjudication of delinquency did not carry the same civil disabilities as conviction of a crime. That &sect; 15-11-63 provided for longer periods of confinement than the prior statute did not make the treatment of juvenile offenders sufficiently similar to that of adults as to trigger the right to a jury trial. The juvenile raised other constitutional objections to the statute, but as he did not specify either the particular part or parts of the statute that he was challenging or how those part or parts of the statute violated the constitutional provisions, the claims were not reviewed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, on behalf of her daughter who was injured while in appellee's care, brought suit alleging breach of contract and negligence. The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The appeals court affirmed judgment as to the negligence claim, because appellee was a public service entity entitled to immunity from suit as a state agency would be, and that such immunity was not waived. The court further held that there was no evidence of a written contract between the parties; thus summary judgment was proper on the claim for breach. However, appellant alleged she would possibly be an intended third party beneficiary, and thus have standing to maintain an action. The court agreed, and remanded the case to the trial court for consideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals of Georgia reversed appellee's conviction of child molestation on the grounds that the trial court erred in not suppressing evidence obtained from an illegal arrest. The State of Georgia sought certiorari, and appellee filed a motion to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer who arrested appellee knew from three complainants that a man had fondled a child; two complainants had identified appellee as the molester. The officer entered appellee's van with his consent, found used latex gloves, petroleum jelly, female underpants, and loaded guns. In appellee's trial for child molestation, the trial court denied appellee's motion to suppress evidence seized after his arrest, holding that appellee's warrantless arrest was lawful. The court of appeals reversed, finding that the arrest was illegal. The State petitioned for a writ of certiorari. The instant court granted the writ, and reversed. First, it held that it had jurisdiction under the Georgia Constitution to review, at the State's request, court of appeals decisions that favored criminal defendants. Second, it found that the arrest was supported by probable cause and was legal; thus, the trial court did not err in admitting evidence seized from the van. Appellee waived his right to claim error in the admission of sexually explicit material by not objecting at trial. Evidence he did object to was either properly admitted, or its admission was not deemed reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the court of appeals reversed, and that of the trial court affirmed. The supreme court had the power, derived from the state constitution and independent of statute, to review the State's appeal from the court of appeals' decision in favor of appellee. The trial court correctly concluded that appellee's arrest was supported by probable cause, so its denial of appellee's motion to suppress evidence obtained in the arrest was proper.</SPAN></P>

The Georgia Supreme Court found the provisions of the ordinance provided defendant with notice he was forbidden to have more than four dogs and/or cats until he obtained a permit.

He went there and was let in by two uniformed officers who told him that they were caring for the children. There he saw and seized pantyhose on a banister, notes on a door referring to abuse by tying, and a belt and cord that may have caused the dead child's wounds. Defendants, adult residents, were indicted for murder, assault, battery, and cruelty. Defendants' motion to suppress was granted. The court reversed. The detective could join his colleagues at the home even though the exigency justifying invasion no longer existed. Also, insufficient care by the officers already present could itself have been an exigency. There was no showing that an exigency had been manufactured or that the detective's intrusion expanded the initial police intrusion. The seized items were in plain view.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion and appellant challenged the ruling. The court held the double jeopardy clause of the Georgia constitution protected against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal or conviction, and multiple punishments for the same offense. The court admonished it did not prohibit additional punishment for a separate offense which the general assembly intended a separate sanction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a judgment of the Cobb State Court, Georgia, finding that, as applied in this case, a county sign ordinance effected an unconstitutional taking by preventing the repair of appellees' &quot;grandfathered&quot; non-conforming sign without compensation for the sign.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were charged with 168 criminal violations of a county's sign ordinances. The alleged violations stemmed from a particular ordinance, which regulated the conditions under which existing off-premises advertising signs could be perpetuated. The trial court found that, as applied in this case, the ordinance effected an unconstitutional taking by preventing the repair of a &quot;grandfathered&quot; non-conforming sign without compensation for the sign. The State appealed, contending that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 32-6-83, the statute requiring compensation, did not apply because appellees did not have a lawful right to use the sign at the time a tornado damaged it because the lot was a non-conforming size and had no means of ingress and egress. Judgment was affirmed. The sign ordinance at issue was inapplicable because it would have operated to do that which &sect; 32-6-83 declared it could not do. The lot size and access problems were a result of the condemnation and were changed conditions beyond the control of the sign owner. Any tornado damage to the sign that resulted in the sign's failure to meet ordinance requirements was also a changed condition beyond the control of the sign owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Because appellees' placement of its sign was rendered illegal by the condemnation and consequent failure to comply with a county sign ordinance, the county could not, under a state statute regulating takings, cause it to be removed by operation of the ordinance without compensation. Further, trial court did not err in concluding that the repair of the sign following the tornado did not require a permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State applied for a writ of certiorari to challenge a Georgia Court of Appeals decision that reversed criminal defendant's conviction entered in the trial court on the grounds that the trial court's system for assigning cases in the trial court violated state law. Defendant had been convicted of four counts of child molestation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was charged with four counts of child molestation. At trial, the trial court used its normal system for assigning case in which the district attorney called the case for trial and assigned it to a judge. The jury convicted defendant on all four counts. Thereafter, in a separate case, the state supreme court found that the case assignment system violated state law. On appeal, the appellate court reversed defendant's conviction based on the state supreme court's decision that the trial court's case assignment system violated state law. The State applied to the court for a writ of certiorari. The court granted the writ and reversed the appellate court's decision. Due to the district attorney's limited role in assigning cases to a judge and calling the court calendar, defendant's state and federal constitutional rights were not violated. Too, while the trial court erred in using the system, the error in using it was harmless. The district attorney's limited discretion and the subsequent independent roles that the trial judge and jury played made it highly improbable the error contributed to the jury's guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and case remanded because the district attorney's limited role in assigning cases to a judge and calling the court calendar--the trial court's system for assigning cases--did not violate defendant's federal or state constitutional rights. Also, it was highly improbable the error in allowing defendant's case to proceed under that system contributed to the verdict finding defendant guilty on all four child molestation counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the Sumter County Superior Court, Georgia, contending the court improperly found him competent to stand trial, erred by denying him a right to represent himself, by failing to conduct a hearing on his competence, and by forcing representation upon him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to, inter alia, two counts of malice murder, six counts of felony murder, and two counts of aggravated assault, resulting from his plan to effectuate his own death by capital punishment. He received eight death sentences. On appeal, the court held defendant was properly found competent, the trial judge did not force representation upon him, and did not err in refusing a request to proceed pro se. Defendant's execution was not suicide because the sentence was based on the nature of his crimes, not his own desire to die. Further, the jury made the final determination of death as the appropriate punishment. The court further set aside the six felony murder convictions and death sentences, as similar to malice murder, and the two aggravated assault convictions under the merger doctrine. Finally, the court found the death penalty was not an excessive sentence as to one victim given the outrageous and vile nature of the crime committed, but could not find the statutory aggravated circumstance regarding the aggravated battery to that victim's wife. The same error also appeared in her murder because mutually supporting aggravating circumstances were impermissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed in part, vacated in part. Two of the death sentences affirmed, vacated were the six convictions and death sentences for felony murder, the convictions and sentences for aggravated assault. Defendant not coerced into representing himself as he fully understood the nature and extent of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
