Ann. &sect; 62-6-4(D) required a hearing, and the notices could not be rejected for alleged noncompliance with the pleading requirements of N.M. Code R. 1.2.2.27, as N.M. Stat.

Code R. 19.25.13.27, issued by petitioner state engineer pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-2-9.1 (2003). The district court and Court of Appeals (New Mexico) concluded the statute did not authorize the state engineer to issue the regulations, and the state engineer's certiorari petition, and the holder's cross-petition, were granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The holder said the regulations violated separation of powers. The supreme court disagreed because the enacting legislation's title gave the state engineer new authority. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-2-9.1 (2003) was not limited to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-2-9's (1907) subject matter because the state engineer had to adopt rules outside the adjudication process. The regulations did not unconstitutionally find water priorities without an inter se adjudication because (1) N.M. Const. art. XVI gave no right to such an adjudication, (2) water rights adjudication was a creature of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 72-4-15 to 72-4-19, and (3) the state engineer could manage priorities before an adjudication. The regulations did not unconstitutionally deny a water right without a formal adjudication because junior rights could be curtailed without such adjudication. The regulations' administrative process time did not deny due process because claimed harm was speculative. Letting the state engineer consider the &quot;best available evidence,&quot; under N.M. Code R. 19.25.13.27, was not vague because (1) persons of reasonable intelligence had notice of the evidence, and (2) he could use reasoned independent judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees lessees contested appellant Commissioner of Public Lands' (Commissioner) assessment of additional royalties under oil and gas leases of state lands. The trial court certified for interlocutory appeal orders granting the lessees summary judgment and denying reconsideration of a dismissal of the Commissioner's breach of implied covenant to market counterclaim. The Court of Appeals (New Mexico) certified the appeal to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessees deducted postproduction costs when calculating the State's royalty payments. The supreme court held the leases allowed such deductions because (1) such costs were generally deducted when calculating a royalty obligation, wherever the sale occurred, (2) extrinsic evidence supported this interpretation, and (3) N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-10-61 (1972) required the state to reasonably compensate lessees for use of their postproduction facilities. It was no error to rely on course of dealing and course of performance evidence because it could be used to decide contract ambiguity. The lessees did not have to pay royalties on field and plant fuel because (1) they derived no proceeds from it, and (2) the leases' free use clauses let them use it to operate the leases. They had to pay royalties on any profitable use of drip condensate because (1) all oil and gas not provided for under the free use clauses was reserved for royalty, and (2) the clauses did not require royalties if no proceeds were derived. A maximum price clause did not bar deducting postproduction costs because it only let the Commissioner make the lessees deduct such costs if needed to use the lands for oil or gas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of Santa Fe County, New Mexico, ruled that the arresting officer's DWI investigation was unlawful and on that basis entered an order suppressing all evidence from the investigation and therefore dismissing the DWI charge against defendant. Appellant city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court noted that double jeopardy barred the city from retrying defendant on the DWI charge, and therefore it had to dismiss the city's appeal. Jeopardy had attached because the city presented evidence against defendant to the district court. The district court based its order of dismissal on an evidentiary ruling that directly related to defendant's guilt or innocence. That was because in suppressing the evidence resulting from the DWI investigation after the city had rested its case and dismissing the DWI charge, the district court implicitly held the evidence to be insufficient to support defendant's conviction on the DWI charge. The supreme court noted that barring resolution of the suppression issue before trial, the district court should have continued defendant's trial, and the city should have sought such a continuance, to allow the city to seek an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal of an administrative license revocation proceeding, the Supreme Court of New Mexico held that (1) under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-8-112(E)(2), G, MVD had to find that the arrest and underlying police activity were constitutional as a prerequisite to revoking a driver's license under the Implied Consent Act; (2) the district court had to review constitutional questions arising from a license revocation hearing as an appellate court; and (3) MVD and the district court correctly concluded that revocation of petitioner's driver's license was proper. The State met its burden to show the officer's encounter was constitutional, as he was acting as a community caretaker when he saw petitioner's motorcycle fall. The officer had reasonable suspicion to expand the encounter into a DWI investigation, because petitioner smelled of alcohol, had bloodshot eyes, and admitted he had been drinking.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner supported the child financially and co-parented the child for years until the parties dissolved their relationship.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a case involving the apportionment of the New Mexico House of Representatives following the 2010 federal census, petitioners filed petitions for a writ of superintending control asking the court to assume jurisdiction over the case. Petitioners asked the court to either reverse the district court and adopt an alternative plan or remand the case with instructions regarding the legal standards that the district court should apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The plan ultimately adopted by the district court, Executive Alternative Plan 3, did not undergo the same scrutiny for partisan bias that the majority of the plans that were previously considered had undergone.  Because Executive Alternative Plan 3 contained significant partisan performance changes, the court concluded that the district court should have rejected it. A consolidated district in central Albuquerque raised questions. It resulted in a strongly partisan district favoring one political party, in effect tilting the balance for that party without any valid justification. A more competitive district should have been created if at all practicable to avoid this political advantage to one political party and disadvantage to the other. The district court appropriately exercised its equitable powers to insist on the consolidation of districts in the underpopulated regional areas of north central and southeastern New Mexico, as well as central Albuquerque. The problem noted with the central Albuquerque consolidation was not the fact that the consolidation occurred, but the manner in which the consolidation was accomplished.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the matter to the district court to draw its own House redistricting map.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner legislators sought a writ of mandamus invalidating respondent New Mexico Governor's partial veto of House Bill 59, 50th Leg., 1st Sess. (N.M. 2011), which sought to amend five different sections of the Unemployment Compensation Law (Act), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 51-1-1 to -59 (1936, as amended through 2010). The Governor struck one of the variables in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51-1-11(I)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court noted that a writ of mandamus was proper because the next legislative session in January 2012 would not start, much less produce a possible remedy, until after the language at issue in House Bill 59 took effect. The supreme court found that the Governor's veto did not return the Act to its former language but arbitrarily eliminated the Contribution Schedule variable used to determine established employer contributions to the unemployment compensation fund for the year 2012. The Governor's veto deleted a portion of the bill that specifically related to another portion of the bill that was retained: the &quot;after 2012&quot; language found in House Bill 59, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51-1-11(I)(2), had been added to delay the formula-based Contribution Schedule during 2012, the year for which the vetoed provision had provided an interim, fixed Contribution Schedule. The Governor's veto impermissibly left an incomplete and unworkable Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A writ of mandamus was issued ordering the reinstatement of House Bill 59 as passed by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate brought a certiorari proceeding to challenge a decision from a district court (New Mexico), which dismissed, with prejudice, the inmate's petition for writ of habeas corpus alleging ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with a death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court dismissed the petition as a sanction for the inmate's refusal to answer deposition questions. The court held that the prohibition in N.M. R. Ann. 5-503 against compelling witness statements from criminal defendants applied, in accordance with N.M. R. Ann. 5-101(A), because a postconviction habeas corpus proceeding under N.M. R. Ann. 5-802 was part of the inmate's criminal proceedings under the New Mexico Rules of Criminal Procedure. Thus, it was improper under Rule 5-503 for the district court to order him to answer questions at a deposition and to dismiss his habeas petition or otherwise sanction him for not answering the questions. The court further held that the New Mexico Rules of Evidence applied in the habeas proceeding pursuant to N.M. R. Ann. 11-101 and that communications relevant to the inmate's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were excepted from the attorney-client privilege under N.M. R. Ann. 11-503(D)(3). The relevance determination was a preliminary question for the district court as provided in N.M. R. Ann. 11-104(A). Because an exception applied, there was no privilege that could be waived; thus, N.M. R. Ann. 11-511 was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the dismissal of the petition for writ of habeas corpus and remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of seven counts of violating the Sexual Exploitation of Children Act for covertly videotaping two female minors while they used a bathroom. The appellate court reversed, holding that the videotaped images did not depict a prohibited sexual act sufficient to support a conviction. The state supreme court reversed, holding that the images did depict a prohibited sexual act under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-6A-2(A)(5) because they were focused on the girls' genitals and were made for the purpose of sexual stimulation. On remand, the appellate court held that the state supreme court's interpretation of the act was unconstitutional as to defendant. On further review, the state supreme court held that it was hardly novel, much less unforeseeable, that lewdness could be assessed through the prism of an image's voyeuristic character. Defendant's images focused relentlessly on exposed pubic areas of minor girls, and defendant made no claim of an innocent or artistic theme; to the contrary, he conceded that the images were made for his sexual gratification. Further, the covert angle contributed to making the theme voyeuristic and therefore sexual.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 16-year-old defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of San Juan County (New Mexico) convicting him of murder, aggravated burglary, armed robbery, and unlawful taking of a motor vehicle and sentencing him to life in prison plus 19 and one-half years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress because he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights, as: (1) notwithstanding defendant's ADHD diagnosis, there was no evidence that he lacked sufficient intelligence to have understood his rights or the consequences of waiving them; (2) even though defendant was primarily a Spanish speaker, he was also a fluent English speaker; and (3) he had been advised of his rights on previous occasions and had refused to speak to authorities without a lawyer present on at least on occasion. Defendant's convictions of armed robbery under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-16-2 (1973) and unlawful taking of a motor vehicle under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-3-504(A)(2) (1998) violated his right against double jeopardy because defendant's armed robbery conviction required proof of the taking of the victim's vehicle, and it therefore subsumed the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle conviction. The trial court erred by failing to order a presentence report from adult probation services as required by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-18-15.3(E) (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's sentence was reversed and the case was remanded for resentencing with instructions that a presentence report be prepared.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court noted that the question was whether the Governor's removal of the members of the PELRB was at odds with the Governor's responsibility to ensure that the Public Employee Bargaining Act's (Act) intended goals were effectuated.

The removal of the board member selected by the unions cast a pall over the operations of the PELRB and evinced a willingness to interfere with the unions' right to designated a board member of their choice. The Act expressly prohibited an employer from interfering with a public employee's rights under the Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-7E-19(B) (2003). Interpreting N.M. Const. art. V, &sect; 5 to empower the Governor to arbitrarily remove its members would not comport with the requirements of due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioner sought to exchange state trust land for privately held parcels in order to consolidate state land into larger, contiguous parcels. After extensive private negotiations with the owners of the desired parcels, the Commissioner announced an auction pursuant to criteria that provided for broad discretion in selecting a successful bid. The court found mandamus jurisdiction proper under N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3 and N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 44-2-4, 44-2-5 (1884) because there was no adequate remedy at law and the Commissioner had a ministerial duty to comply with the legal requirements for land sales. The court held that the exchanges violated &sect; 10 of New Mexico's Enabling Act, 36 Stat. 557, as adopted by N.M. Const. art. XXI, &sect; 9, because an exchange was not a discretionary form of disposal and there was no true public auction as required for in-kind sales. As a matter of law, private negotiation negated the required competition. Further, the criteria for a successful bid lacked sufficient objectivity. A writ of mandamus directing the Commissioner to cancel the sales pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-7-8 (1912) was the appropriate remedy.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court of New Mexico held that the amenability determination was not within the scope of the Apprendi rule, and the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a jury trial did not apply.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of McKinley County, New Mexico, convicted defendant of child abuse resulting in the death of a child under twelve years, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-6-1(D). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it refused to inform the jury that it had the option of hanging. The supreme court found that the duration and time of day of the jury's deliberations, combined with the trial court's conspicuous failure to answer the jury's question regarding the option of hanging, left the jury with the impression that it had to continue its deliberations indefinitely. The trial court's failure to issue a supplementary instruction coerced the jury into reaching a verdict. The trial court properly denied defendant's request for a lesser included offense instruction where there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction for simple child abuse not resulting in death. The trial court could have reasonably believed the District Attorney's statements in his affidavit that, prior to defendant's motion for disqualification, he was unaware of any familial or clan relationship between them and that he never had personal or direct contact with defendant. There was no personal bias warranting disqualification. The trial court could reduce defendant's parole eligibility by up to ten years, resulting in a sentence of twenty years of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ten-year-old victim was shot to death after defendant blasted nine rounds at his house. Defendant claimed that due to pretrial publicity, he could not obtain a fair trial in the Ninth Judicial District, which was composed of Curry County and Roosevelt County. As the evidence was insufficient to establish that Roosevelt County was subject to exception, the judge properly ordered venue to be removed to another county within the same judicial district as Curry County in accordance with N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-3-7. The trial court properly ruled that defendant's peremptory strike against a white male venireperson violated Batson, whereas the State's peremptory strikes against Hispanic venirepersons did not. The State provided the race-neutral reasons for striking the Hispanic venirepersons: one fell asleep during voir dire, another juror was involved in crimes prosecuted by the prosecutor, a juror had a son and granddaughter who were criminal defendants, a juror was familiar with a potential witness, and another juror's uncle had been represented by defense counsel. As there was no error and defendant received a fair trial, his cumulative error claim was rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, age 17, was originally charged as a serious youthful offender with first-degree murder of an infant child. The prosecution dismissed the murder charge and substituted child abuse resulting in death--a youthful offender offense. Defendant pled guilty, agreed to an adult disposition, and received an adult sentence of 18 years imprisonment. In sentencing defendant as an adult, the children's court did not first determine whether defendant was amenable to treatment or rehabilitation as a juvenile as required by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32A-2-20(B), (C). Defendant sought to withdraw his plea and proceed to trial as an alleged youthful offender. The Supreme Court of New Mexico held that defendant should have received an amenability determination before being sentenced as an adult. He was not permitted to waive the amenability determination as part of the plea. Therefore, his plea was void. The Court of Appeals erred by concluding otherwise.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the State presented sufficient evidence to permit the jury to conclude that defendant killed the victim with deliberate intent. The evidence established that defendant was upset and depressed after his girlfriend ended their six-year relationship, that defendant was obsessed with her, that defendant was angry that his ex-girlfriend was seeing the victim, that defendant confronted the victim about his relationship with defendant's former girlfriend and threatened to kill him, that defendant then went into his apartment and exited a few moments later with a gun in his hand, and that defendant ran toward the victim, firing at him five or six times. Additionally, the jury was presented with physical evidence from which it could have inferred deliberate intent because there was evidence that the victim was shot twice at point-blank range while he was in the passenger seat of a car and was shot in his buttocks as he was attempting to flee from the car.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After rear-ending a vehicle and leaving the scene of the accident, defendant was handcuffed in his driveway by a police service aide (PSA), pending the arrival of police officers to investigate defendant's involvement in the accident. Defendant contended that the PSA's lack of statutory authority to detain or arrest him was an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, entitling him to the remedy of suppression. The court concluded that the PSA, who was not a commissioned police officer, was without statutory authority to either detain or arrest defendant. The PSA's actions in detaining defendant constituted an arrest under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-8-124(A) (1961). However, the PSA's lack of statutory authority to seize defendant did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable seizures. Defendant's consent to have his blood drawn was valid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a scuffle at a mall, defendant was taken into custody by mall security personnel and was searched. During the search, the security guards discovered that defendant was in possession of cocaine, which was turned over to the police. Defendant moved to suppress the cocaine and his inculpatory statements. The district court granted defendant's motion, and the appellate court upheld the suppression order, holding that the security guards were state actors and subject to the restrictions of the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV. On review, the court held that private security guards were not state agents; in order for them to be deemed state agents, a government agent must have been involved directly as a participant in the illegal search. Merely acceptance of the evidentiary fruits by state agents, without more, did not constitute ratification of the security guards' conduct. Thus, any improprieties by the private security guards could not be imputed to the state, and defendant failed to establish a constitutional basis under the Fourth Amendment to suppress the evidence obtained against him by private security guards who were acting on their own.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, residents of an independent living facility for senior citizens, petitioned for review of a decision of the New Mexico Court of Appeals, which reversed a district court judgment that found defendant, a nonprofit owner and operator of independent living facilities, liable to plaintiffs' class for violating the New Mexico Continuing Care Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 24-17-1 to -18 (1985), and for breach of plaintiffs' entrance agreements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that defendant had a statutory obligation to consider reasonable return on investment, unless it was impossible to do so. The lack of precision in the Act, far from prejudicing defendant, liberated it from any unfair restrictions in complying with the statute. Nothing prevented defendant from more precisely defining reasonable return on investment in its entrance agreements, including what it considered &quot;reasonable,&quot; so as to provide residents with notice of its rate-setting practices in compliance with the Act. The evidence at trial established that defendant did not attempt to construe or apply the reasonable-return-on-investment factor before imposing rate increases. For defendant to argue that it complied with its statutory and contractual obligations, it had to have made some attempt to calculate reasonable return on investment before imposing rate increases. Substantial evidence existed to uphold the district court's determination that defendant violated the Act and the terms of its entrance agreements by imposing rate increases without considering reasonable return on investment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the court of appeals and upheld the judgment of the district court.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 30-2-1 (1994) and 31-18-16 (1993). The trial court accepted defendant's guilty plea and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and two others kidnapped and murdered the victim because they heard that she was a rat. In exchange for dismissal of kidnapping and conspiracy charges, defendant agreed to plead guilty to the murder charge. The plea agreement expressly provided that no representations were being made regarding possible sentences, and the trial court fully and repeatedly advised defendant that he was subject to the full range of possible punishments, including life imprisonment. The court held that because defendant entered an unconditional plea of guilty, he did not reserve the right to raise his cruel and unusual punishment claim on appeal. The court could review jurisdictional errors only. Because defendant's sentence of life imprisonment was expressly authorized by the Criminal Sentencing Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 31-18-12 to -26 (1977, as amended through 2003), specifically N.M. Stat.

The supreme court granted defendant's petition for writ of certiorari on the issue of whether the initial traffic stop was based upon reasonable suspicion that he violated a traffic law. The traffic stop was based upon reasonable suspicion the supreme court affirmed the denial of the motion to suppress. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-7-325(A) only required that the surrounding facts established that there was a reasonable possibility that the deputy might have been affected. The appellate court required a greater show of effect than the statute contemplated. The deputy also made no mistake about the applicable rules of law relating to the mandatory use of turn signals.

The legislature excluded the age of onset factor from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' definition of mental retardation, which required symptoms to begin during childhood. Regarding commitment, N.M. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer had begun constructing a hotel on its property when it accidentally ruptured an encroaching City of Albuquerque waterline, causing it to incur excess construction costs and delaying the hotel's opening.

The district court found the developer's lost profits and excess construction costs to be the direct result of the City's taking and awarded it damages, along with expert witness costs. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding the direct award of lost profits in this case would constitute the impermissible award of the full measure of tort damages and that the portion of the excess construction costs was subject to a test of reasonableness. The Supreme Court of New Mexico held that the developer was entitled to recover its lost profits and excess construction costs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court noted that the organization had standing and that mandamus was an appropriate remedy. The Secretary claimed that she had a duty not to enforce N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-9-4.2(B)(4) (subsection (B)(4)) because of a perceived conflict with federal law. The supreme court found that subsection (B)(4), when combined with the specific guidelines the Secretary had originally implemented, provided sufficient statewide uniformity to comply with both Bush v. Gore and the plain language of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 15301-15545 (2005). The statute achieved an appropriate balance between ensuring against disenfranchisement and promoting uniformity in the interpretation of hand-written ballots. Under HAVA, states were required to have certain minimum standards that were consistent geographically, as well as in terms of traditional bases for discrimination. Subsection (B)(4), in concert with the guidelines originally promulgated by the Secretary, provided sufficient assurances that county clerks in various parts of the state would interpret &quot;voter's intent&quot; in a uniform and nondiscriminatory fashion. This standard met the requirements of HAVA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ACLU filed suit challenging the constitutionality of a city ordinance that provided for the civil forfeiture of a vehicle driving by an individual arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI). The city moved to dismiss for lack of standing, and the ACLU moved for a permanent injunction. The district court denied the city's motion and granted that of the ACLU. The city appealed, and the appellate court reversed, finding that the ACLU lacked standing. On review, the court declined the ACLU's invitation to revise its law on standing and held that standing required an injury in fact. The court held that the ACLU lacked standing to challenge the ordinance. The ACLU could not show a high likelihood that any ACLU member would be arrested for DWI, let alone wrongly arrested, and exposed to the threat of having a vehicle forfeited under the ordinance. If a person engaged in the legal conduct of driving, there was no credible threat that the person would be prosecuted for that conduct; that there was merely the hypothetically possibility that a person would be wrongly arrested for DWI was not sufficient to establish the threat of a direct injury required for standing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A New Mexico District Court dismissed the State's appeal of a magistrate's order granting defendant's dismissal of the criminal complaint.

The State petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued that the magistrate court's order of dismissal was a final appealable order and that the district court erred in refusing to exercise its jurisdiction to hear a de novo appeal in the case. The supreme court determined that the order of dismissal was indeed, on its face an order dismissing the State's case. Although the State did not have a right to appeal an order of suppression, it did have the constitutional right to appeal from a dismissal, unless that order was predicated on a finding of acquittal. Therefore, the State was entitled to a de novo trial in the district court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court decided that the district court could only apply forum law to class members from other states if the laws of the states connected to the dispute were identical or were different but produced identical results and held that it would be improper to apply New Mexico laws to the entire class where the laws of the relevant states could produce different results. On review, the court held that the possibility of a potential conflict did not defeat the application of forum law; rather, only proof of an actual conflict would preclude a district court from making a determination that it could apply forum law. The party opposing certification must establish that the laws of the relevant states actually conflict. If the class proponents have met their burden and the party opposing certification fails to show that the laws of the relevant states actually conflict through clearly established, plainly contradictory law, then the district court could not be faulted if it concluded that there is no material conflict between the laws of the relevant states.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner lessee sued respondent city, alleging that the city, in adopting a new sector plan that restricted the uses on the lessee's property, had downzoned the property without complying with case law and in violation of the lessee's procedural due process rights. A jury agreed with the lessee and awarded damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The Court of Appeals of New Mexico reversed. The lessee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city's adoption of the uptown sector plan intense core restrictions was not a legislative act, to which case law regarding downzoning did not apply, where the restrictions did not apply citywide, but were confined to a small portion of the uptown sector. Moreover, the changes were tailored to only affect the lessee's property as they did not place limits on retail uses for redevelopment or replacement of existing developments. The fact that the city postponed a decision on the lessee's proposal while it rushed the sector plan amendments through a legislative process led to a fair inference that the uptown sector plan was meant to change the former sector plan, not simply clarify it. Thus, the adoption of the sector plan was quasi-judicial in nature and the city was required to apply case law that required either a change in the surrounding community or a mistake in the original zoning to justify downzoning. The city's argument that adopting the sector plan was not a rezoning was rejected as the amended sector plan imposed substantive restrictions on the lessee's property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The first administrative appeal was reversed and the district court was affirmed on that matter. The case was remanded to consider the city's remaining claims of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the substance of the pleadings filed in district court requested post-conviction relief, the court of appeals concluded that the proceedings in district court were governed by N.M.

For two petitioners, the petitions filed in district court specifically requested three types of extraordinary writs: superintending control, prohibition, and mandamus. Appellate review of those district court actions was with the court of appeals. As to the other petition, the court of appeals erred in transferring the case because it had jurisdiction over the State's interlocutory appeal. The supreme court had the authority to remand erroneously transferred cases to the court of appeals for resolution on the merits. The court of appeals was encouraged to continue the practice of transferring true habeas corpus cases to the supreme court to ensure that the merits of the litigant's habeas claim could be heard in properly transferred cases.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court, answering in the affirmative, held that: (1) under U.S. Supreme Court cases, the Sixth Amendment was violated any time a defendant was sentenced above what was authorized solely by the jury's verdict; (2) in the case at hand, defendant's enhanced sentences were thus unconstitutional; (3) &sect; 31-18-15.1 was facially unconstitutional because, as written, it could never be applied in a manner consistent with the Sixth Amendment; and (4) this decision announced a new rule that could not be applied retroactively because it was neither a substantive rule nor a &quot;watershed&quot; rule of criminal procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was tried in plaintiff city's municipal court for violating several municipal ordinances. After ruling that defendant's arrest was illegal, the municipal court judge dismissed the charges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">N.M. Stat. &sect; 35-15-11 (1959) allowed a municipality to appeal from a municipal court to a district court only when the municipal court held an ordinance unconstitutional or a complaint insufficient. The issue presented in the case at hand was whether a district court had jurisdiction to entertain a city's appeal from a municipal court's dismissal of charges against a defendant on grounds other than the constitutionality of an ordinance or the sufficiency of a complaint. The supreme court rejected various arguments by the city, but ultimately concluded that a district court had such jurisdiction under N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect; 27, which provided that appeals were allowed in all cases from the final judgments and decisions of the probate courts and other inferior courts to the district courts, and in all such appeals, trial was de novo unless otherwise provided by law. Because the state legislature could not abridge a constitutional right, the second sentence of N.M. Stat. &sect; 35-15-11 (limiting a municipality's right to appeal to two circumstances) was without force.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate had been convicted of second-degree murder and other charges. Contrary to his trial testimony, the inmate's brother admitted to shooting the victims himself. Based an assertion of actual innocence, the inmate sought habeas relief. The district court denied the petition, and a petition for a writ of certiorari was filed. In affirming the district court, the supreme court determined that claims of actual innocence were not a ground for federal habeas relief absent an independent constitutional violation. However, the supreme court departed from this federal precedent. The continued incarceration of an innocent person was contrary to both N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 13 and N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18. Habeas relief was available on this ground if the inmate was able to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in light of new evidence. The requirements applicable to motions for a new trial were relevant, but did not constrain the consideration of other evidence. However, the inmate here failed to meet the actual innocence standard since there were credibility issues relating to the testimony of the inmate and his brother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school district entered into a contract with the water company which provided for construction of a water line extension to a new school. The school district was required to make a contribution in aid of construction (CIAC) of the extension pursuant to New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (PRC) Rule 19, N.M. Stat. Ann.&sect; 17.12.760.10. After making a payment for construction of the water line, the school district asserted it was entitled to deduct the amount of the CIAC from the compensation due to the water company. The court concluded that eminent domain principles required the school district to pay the fair market value of the disputed property. Deducting a CIAC from the condemnation award would result in an unconstitutional deprivation of the water company's property without just compensation. The school district's claim of unjust enrichment overlooked the fact that the water company was required to supply water by the PRC and that the school district was required to contribute to the construction of appropriate facilities by the PRC. The water company owned the property being condemned and there was no basis for the school district's claim of equitable title.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was given probation on two different cases after a guilty plea was entered. The sentences were ordered to be served consecutively. Defendant sought review when probation was later revoked in both cases under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-21-15 (1989). The court of appeals held that revocation in one case was improper because the sentence had expired. However, it upheld the revocation for the other case, even though defendant had not begun serving that sentence. Defendant then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. In granting the writ and affirming the court of appeals, the supreme court construed the consecutive sentences as one continuous sentence under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33-2-39 (1889). Under Padilla, the district court retained jurisdiction to revoke defendant's suspended sentence subsequent to the entry of its judgment and prior to the expiration of the entire continuous sentence. Probation was granted in the hope that defendant was able to be rehabilitated, and, in its discretion, the district court was allowed to revoke probation when the goal of rehabilitation is not being achieved, even if defendant had not yet commenced serving the probationary term being revoked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court deferred to the Board on matters of weight and credibility, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Board's decision and resolving all conflicts and reasonable inferences in favor of that decision. However, the court reviewed the Board's legal conclusions and recommendations de novo and retained its authority to independently decide whether the evidence was sufficient to deny an applicant bar admission. The Board's finding that the applicant was not of good moral character was supported by substantial evidence where his past conduct was uncontested. The alleged deficiencies in the administrative procedures lacked merit as the Board had fully complied with N.M. R. Ann. 15-301(C). The good moral character standard was constitutional as the requirement's long usage had given it well-defined contours, the requirement was rationally connected to the applicant's fitness to practice law, and the applicant had not shown any difference in the way the rules treated applicants and attorneys in disciplinary proceedings. The assessment of attorney's fees was improper as unitemized expenses for attorney fees did not fit within the intent of N.M. R. Ann. 15-102(A)(3).</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-16-3(D) (1993), and five counts of criminal sexual penetration during a commission of a felony violating official acts prohibited. The New Mexico Court of Appeals affirmed defendant's convictions. Defendant's petition for certiorari was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions arose out of sexual encounters between defendant and a woman who was a criminal defendant in his courtroom. After the parties filed their briefs, the State filed a supplemental brief alerting the court that the New Mexico Governmental Conduct Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-16-1 et seq. (1967), under which defendant was convicted, appeared to expressly exclude judges from prosecution under the Act. The court concluded that the legislature expressly chose to exclude judges from the Act's application. The selective incorporation of legislators into some sections of the Act indicated that the legislature was aware of how to apply some sections of the Act to only certain categories of public officers or employees. If the legislature had wanted some sections of the Act to also apply to judges, it certainly knew how to do so. In conformity with the legislature's intent, the court held that judges were excluded from the Act's application. To hold otherwise would have defeated the goal of giving effect to the legislature's intent. It was fundamental error to convict defendant of official acts prohibited under the Act due to the legislature's express exclusion of judges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's five convictions for official acts prohibited were reversed due to fundamental error. As a result, defendant's five convictions for criminal sexual penetration committed during the commission of official acts prohibited were also reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It was undisputed that employees of respondent mobile home company committed fraud during the sale of a mobile home to petitioner purchasers, a couple. The district court found in favor of the couple and awarded compensatory and punitive damages plus attorney fees. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of New Mexico reversed a portion of the compensatory damages award and reversed the punitive damages award. The couple appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Inter alia, the couple argued that they were entitled to the trial court's full award of $ 17,900 as the company inflated the price of the three-bedroom home by both the amount charged for the garage and decks that the company never intended to construct and the amount given to the couple for their trade-in. The Supreme Court of New Mexico agreed. To recover the trial court's full award, there had to be evidence to support the couple's contention that the credit was illusory and that the company inflated the price of their mobile home by an amount that would consume both the charge for the garage and decks and the down payment. The couple persuasively argued that the evidence demonstrated a pattern of the company's manipulating the numbers so it was difficult to figure out exactly where all the overcharges were hidden. But, when the supreme court looked at the evidence and the reasonable inferences that could be drawn from it, it concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that the company inflated the price of the mobile home so as to deprive the couple of the value of their trade-in, as well as the amount charged for the garage and decks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals' decisions regarding the compensatory and punitive damages claims were reversed. The court of appeals' opinion reinstating the company's counterclaim was affirmed. The couple was entitled to the trial court's full award of compensatory damages for fraud or conversion. The case was remanded to the trial court to assess punitive damages, the couple's attorney fees, and for proceedings on the company's counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee parents sued appellant city and police department alleging negligence in the handling of the investigation into their young son's disappearance. The city objected to producing material related to the on-going criminal investigation. The district court declined to compel production of the entire criminal investigation file. A majority of the Court of Appeals of New Mexico reversed the district court. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals held that the city could not claim executive or public interest privilege. The question was whether documents and other information in an on-going criminal investigation were discoverable in related civil litigation. The tragic backdrop made the conflicting interests in the instant case, between the parents' natural desire to know the fate of their son and a police department's understandable need to protect confidential materials gathered in the course of a criminal investigation, all the more compelling and of substantial public interest. Although New Mexico's rules and constitution did not recognize an executive or public interest privilege in local law enforcement, the Supreme Court of New Mexico believed portions of the criminal investigation files might still be immune from discovery. The absence of a law enforcement privilege did not mean confidential police investigatory materials were completely unprotected from disclosure. Whether the documents were discoverable required the trial court to balance the competing interests between the parents' legitimate discovery requests and law enforcement's need to protect on-going criminal investigations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the court of appeals was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The New Mexico Court of Appeals held that compensatory claims by plaintiff mining property owners against defendants, two state regulatory agencies, were barred by state constitutional sovereign immunity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners claimed that their land interest was taken from them through application of state mining regulations without just compensation and that the State impaired their contractual obligations in violation of the Contracts Clause. The supreme court noted that a regulatory taking could be just as devastating to property rights as a taking by eminent domain and the right of a landowner to compensation was just as central to the promise of the Bill of Rights in either instance. The State failed to provide the remedy of just compensation, the remedy it promised under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The actions of the state agencies imposed environmental regulations which had the effect of taking the owners' property, for which they were entitled to compensation. The supreme court did not agree with the State's assertion that there had to be a specific waiver of immunity before the state could be sued for just compensation under the Takings Clause. The Takings Clause was self-executing, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. The owners' Contracts Clause claim was barred by sovereign immunity because it did not provide for claims for money damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, candidates in the 2004 presidential election, applied to respondent state canvassing board for a recount and recheck of certain ballots and deposited $ 114,400 as required by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-14-15(A) and (B) (2001). The board conditioned beginning the recount and recheck procedures on the candidates first depositing $ 1.4 million, the entire estimated cost, in advance. The District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico)&nbsp;affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The candidates appealed. While the case was on appeal, the legislature amended &sect; 1-14-15(B) to authorize the board to condition any recount on a deposit of the full estimated costs of the recount or any portion thereof. On appeal, the board argued that the 2005 amendment to &sect; 1-14-15 made the instant case moot. The candidates argued that the &sect;&nbsp;1-14-15(B) amendment was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, and as a result the 2001 version of &sect; 1-14-15(B) was still effective. Although moot, the Supreme Court of New Mexico reached the merits of the candidates' claim because it was an issue of substantial public interest and the board's requirement of an advance payment of the recount and recheck costs was capable of repetition yet evading review. The court held that the 2005 amendment to &sect; 1-14-15 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority; consequently, the 2001 version of the statute was still effective. Under the earlier version, the board had no authority to require a deposit of the full estimated costs of the recount and recheck before starting the procedures. However, inter alia, a recount and recheck were no longer possible, making a remand moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent attorney entered a plea of no contest to one misdemeanor count for battery against a household member and he was placed on supervised probation under a conditional discharge pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-20-13(A) (1994). The Attorney Disciplinary Board (New Mexico) recommended that the attorney receive a deferred suspension and be placed on disciplinary probation pursuant to N.M. R. Ann. 17-206(A)(2), and (B)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issues were whether the Supreme Court of New Mexico had the authority to impose discipline on an attorney who had pled no contest to a criminal act and who had been given a conditional discharge pursuant to &sect; 31-20-13(A) and whether there was an exception to the court's general rule that attorneys on probation for a criminal offense are not permitted to practice law. The court answered in the affirmative. The court recognized that N.M. R. Ann. 16-804(B) provided that it was professional misconduct for a lawyer to commit a criminal act and that rule did not require that the lawyer had to be convicted. And, the supreme court concluded that a sentence of conditional discharge did not prevent it from imposing discipline for criminal conduct. But, in the instant case, the court determined that the narrow, very limited exception alluded to in In re Key applied. Inter alia, the continued practice of law by the attorney posed no threat to the public or reputation of the profession and, prohibiting him from continuing to practice law could prove detrimental because the attorney provided highly needed legal services to poor and disadvantaged persons commonly at little or no charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney was suspended from the practice of law deferred for the duration of the five-year period of probation ordered. The attorney was to be on probationary active status for the duration of the five-year period of the district court's probation on condition that he abide by all of the terms imposed by the district court. The attorney was to pay costs to the disciplinary board in the amount of $ 442.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of felony murder after shooting and killing a store owner during a robbery. In response to defendant's motion for a directed verdict, the District Court of Curry County (New Mexico) dismissed the deliberate intent first degree murder charge. The prosecutor acquiesced in the dismissal. Based on the murder of a witness aggravator, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-20A-5(G) (1981),&nbsp;defendant was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence, including defendant's statement, indicated that the store owner grabbed the telephone immediately before being shot, supporting an inference that he intended to call the police. The aggravating factor was that defendant killed the store owner to prevent him from reporting the robbery then in progress or to prevent him from testifying. Defendant's principal argument was that there was insufficient evidence to prove the aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court of New Mexico agreed. The manner of killing, three gunshots at close range, including one in the eye, supported an intent to kill. However, the supreme court did not believe that that evidence supported the further intent to kill the store owner for the purpose of preventing the reporting of a crime. Although defendant sought to conceal his identity and attempted to cover up the crime, that evidence alone was inadequate to support the specific intent required by &sect; 31-20A-5(G) because there existed other plausible motives for the killing. That conclusion was reinforced by the actions of the prosecutor and trial judge in dismissing the deliberate intent first degree murder charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the case was remanded for the imposition of a life sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Lea County District Court (New Mexico) finding that there was sufficient evidence to establish probable cause that the alleged aggravating circumstances, that defendant's victims were killed to prevent them from reporting crimes they witnessed under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-20A-5(G), and one victim was intentionally killed in the commission of a kidnapping under &sect; 31-20A-5(B), were present.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with first-degree murder for killing the two victims, a husband and his wife, while robbing them. The State sought to impose the death penalty based on two aggravating circumstances. On appeal of the district court's decision, the court held that there was no probable cause supporting the murder-of-a-witness aggravating factor for either killing because the record was devoid of circumstantial evidence with a direct link to the requisite motive, and therefore the court was left with nothing but speculation as to defendant's motive in killing the victims. It appeared that the husband was killed very quickly after confronting defendant, leaving defendant little time to form the specific intent to kill for the purpose of silencing a witness. There was no concrete evidence that defendant killed the wife because she was a potential witness to her husband's murder. However, the court found that there was probable cause that the wife was killed in the commission of a kidnapping, making that crime death eligible, because, inter alia, she was found with her hands bound behind her back and she had severe injuries from which she ultimately died.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed insofar as it found probable cause to support the murder-of-a-witness aggravating factor for both killings. The judgment was affirmed insofar as it found that probable cause existed that one victim was intentionally killed in the commission of a kidnapping.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court held that the trial court's good cause instruction did not adequately reflect New Mexico's custodial interference law, however, the erroneous definitional instruction did not amount to reversible error. Defendant's conviction for custodial interference meant that the jury found defendant guilty of both &quot;taking&quot; interference and &quot;failure to return&quot; interference. Either &quot;taking&quot; interference or &quot;failing to return&quot; interference alone constituted illegal custodial interference. Also, the trial court's refusal to give defendant's requested instruction defining protracted period of time was not erroneous because the meaning of the phrase was readily understandable and there was no need for further definition.</SPAN></P>

Defendant properly preserved the issue of whether he should have been given an attempted voluntary manslaughter instruction because the judge understood that defendant was asking for such an instruction, and the judge had an opportunity to modify the instruction to correctly state the law. Additionally, the court held that under limited circumstances, where attempted second-degree murder was offered as a greater-included offense and sufficient provocation is at issue in the trial, attempted voluntary manslaughter might be a crime. Defendant presented evidence of sufficient provocation to support an attempted voluntary manslaughter jury instruction. Therefore, the court reversed his conviction for attempted second-degree murder and remanded to the trial court for a new trial on this count. The court concluded that N.M. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury before the District Court of Catron County, New Mexico, convicted defendant of robbery, burglary, felony murder, conspiracy to commit first degree (felony) murder, conspiracy to commit robbery; and tampering with evidence. The trial court convicted defendant of possession of a firearm by a felon. An aggravated sentence was imposed. Defendant appealed from the judgment and the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and his companion visited the victim with the intent to rob him. They dumped the victim into a well, locked the well's lid, and took his belongings. On appeal, defendant contended that the Sixth Amendment precluded the aggravation of his sentence for conspiracy to commit first degree murder, pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-18-15.1. Defendant also argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the convictions. Defendant argued that under the Sixth Amendment the maximum sentence a judge could impose, without a jury, was the maximum that could be imposed without making additional findings. The supreme court determined that &sect; 31-18-15.1 was constitutional. The supreme court's cases decided under &sect; 31-18-15.1 illustrated the discretion imposed in a judge at sentencing. As well, these cases distinguished the role of the jury in determining whether the State proved the elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case, the findings upon which the trial court relied were not the findings of fact to which the Sixth Amendment's right to a jury applied. Finally, the supreme court determined the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, rape counselors, sought an emergency writ of prohibition or stay of an order of respondent district court judge (New Mexico) that granted defendant's motion to compel disclosure of communications from the alleged rape victim on the ground that the statutory victim-counselor privilege under the Victim Counselor Confidentiality Act (Confidentiality Act), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-25-3 (1987), was not recognized by the rules of evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The counselors entered a special appearance so they could respond to the motion to compel, asserting that the communications they had with the alleged victim were confidential and protected by the Confidentiality Act. The district court granted defendant's motion, reasoning that the Confidentiality Act's victim-counselor privilege was not recognized, thus the statements were not protected. On review, the court held that the Confidentiality Act was consistent with the psychotherapist-patient privilege in N.M. R. Ann. 11-504 (2005) and was to be given effect. The purpose of the psychotherapist-patient privilege was to protect confidential communications made during treatment of a patient's mental or emotional condition from disclosure during court proceedings. The court rejected defendant's argument that the power to prescribe rules of evidence and procedure was vested exclusively in the court. The court held that while it had ultimate rule-making authority, the court had exercised its superintending control under N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3, to revoke or amend a statutory provision when the statutory provision conflicted with an existing court rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court entered an order staying the district court order and then reversed the district court order that granted defendant's motion to compel the rape crisis counselors to disclose communications from the alleged victim. The court remanded the case for a determination of whether the communications were made in the course of a counselor's treatment of the victim for any emotional or psychological condition resulting from a sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners were injured when odors and dust from a remodeling project in the building where they worked caused them to suffer a conditioned psychological response that prevented them from continuing to work. The Act allowed substantially more compensation for persons with physical impairments pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1-42(A)(1) and (2). Therefore the court held that the Act resulted in dissimilar treatment of similarly situated workers. The court, in applying intermediate scrutiny, held that how the disability was caused ceased to be important once a worker has been determined to have suffered a compensable disability. At best, a mentally disabled worker could only receive one-fifth the compensation of a physically disabled worker. The court held that limiting the compensation for mentally disabled workers compared to physically disabled workers was not substantially related to furthering the purposes and goals of the Act. Therefore, the court held that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; Sections 52-1-41 and -42 violated equal protection by discriminating against the mentally disabled in violation of equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>

The doctor performed a closed external reduction and applied a cast. The doctor assured the patient that her wrist was healing properly. Four months later, another surgeon opined that the doctor had negligently treated the patient. The doctor's motion for summary judgment was based on the fact that the patient failed to file her action within the three-year statute of repose period in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;41-5-13. On appeal, the patient argued that the fraudulent concealment doctrine equitably tolled the statute of repose so as to permit her to file her action. The supreme court concluded that the fraudulent concealment doctrine only tolled the statute of repose when a patient did not discover the alleged malpractice within the statutory period as a result of a doctor's fraudulent concealment. The patient, however, became aware of her claim within the statutory period and thus, the doctrine did not toll the statute of repose. In addition, the supreme court concluded that the two years and eight months which the patient had to file her claim was not unreasonably short so as to render &sect; 41-5-13&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During a traffic stop, defendant exited the vehicle and maintained an aggressive posture.

The supreme court noted that the evidence was sufficient to give rise to a reasonable inference that defendant had knowledge of the gun, but given that both defendant and the driver had equal access to the gun, the State needed more than physical proximity to establish defendant's control. The supreme court held that the ammunition clip was enough to create an inference of both knowledge and control, particularly when embellished by the other pieces of incriminating evidence. The supreme court concluded that the officers searched the car and seized the gun, not as evidence of a crime, but in a reasonable effort to secure the scene and were entitled to a reasonable, limited search of the car for weapons, even after the suspects had left the car.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The worker prevailed in a heavily litigated worker's compensation claim, and the worker's attorney sought fees in excess of those allowed by &sect; 52-1-54(I). The issue was whether the limitation violated the worker's rights of equal protection and due process. The worker had standing because he was at risk of significant injury because of his inability to compensate a lawyer on appeal. The court held that rational basis was the proper standard of review given that the record failed to show that some claimants were unable to obtain representation in worker's compensation proceedings or that a decrease in available attorneys rendered access to appellate courts any less meaningful. As applied, &sect; 52-1-54(I) created two classes of workers' compensation litigants: those who did and did not reach the limitation at the administrative stage. However, there was no evidence to demonstrate that, other than in this particular case, the limitation had been insufficient to cover workers' attorney fees. Because &sect; 52-1-54(I) helped to maximize workers' take-home awards and increase the efficiency of the system, the limitation satisfied substantive due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that each amendment was aimed at a distinct area of the DWI statute, thus they could be construed harmoniously to give effect to each.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was spotted at the scene of a burglary. After he left, the victim caught another perpetrator. The accomplice later gave a statement implicating defendant. After defendant absconded, the accomplice was deported. When defendant was tried, an officer was permitted to read the statement of the accomplice into evidence. After he was convicted, defendant sought review. In reversing, the court determined that defendant's right to confrontation was violated based on the admission of the statement. The information was testimonial because it was elicited by law enforcement during an interrogation. It should not have been admitted because defendant did not have an opportunity for cross-examination. To the extent that State v. Torres, 126 N.M. 477, 971 P.2d 1267 (1998) held otherwise, it was overruled. Further, defendant's act of absconding did not constitute a waiver of the confrontation right because it did not procure the absence of the witness. The admission of the evidence did not amount to harmless error. Finally, the court held that the two convictions under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-16-1 (1987) did not violate double jeopardy because two separate offenses were clearly created.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner appealed a decision of the district court (New Mexico), which granted petitioner's request to reinstate additional good-time credits, but denied petitioner's request for other habeas corpus relief as to his claim that he was transferred in retaliation for his involvement in protected grievance activities, that he was deprived of spousal visitation indefinitely without notice and hearing, and that he was denied proper medical treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner challenged the district court's denial of habeas corpus relief. The court held that the district court's determination that retaliation was not the &quot;but for&quot; motive behind petitioner's transfers was supported by substantial evidence that showed the transfers were based on prison safety concerns because of reports from multiple sources that petitioner was a gang member and intended to have other inmates commit violent acts against another inmate. The court found that the suspension of spousal visitation indefinitely without notice or a hearing constituted a violation of petitioner's due process rights. The court held that petitioner should have been given notice and an opportunity to confront the persons who accused his wife of helping him with drug activity within the prison during visitation. The court rejected petitioner's Eighth Amendment claim that he was intentionally exposed to the hepatitis virus and received improper medical treatment. The evidence showed that petitioner had been tested nine times, and a difference of opinion as to proper or reasonable treatment between petitioner and prison medical personnel did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the portions of the district court judgment that held petitioner's transfers were not in retaliation for challenging his conditions of confinement and that denied petitioner's Eighth Amendment claim regarding medical treatment. However, the court found that petitioner was denied due process when spousal visitation was denied indefinitely without notice or a hearing and remanded the case for further consistent proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with first-degree murder and the State sought the death penalty. The State appealed from an order by the trial court (New Mexico) declaring that the statutory procedure for determining mental retardation in death-penalty defendants, as specified in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-20A-2.1(C) (1991), was unconstitutional. The New Mexico Court of Appeals certified the case to the instant court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the death penalty based on his mental retardation under &sect; 30-20A-2.1(C). The motion was denied as premature. Defendant then field a motion requesting a jury determination of his mental retardation. The trial court held the procedure under &sect; 30-20A-2.1(C) was unconstitutional as it did not require the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was mentally retarded, and it did not allow for a pretrial judicial determination. The state supreme court held that as mental retardation operated to reduce a death sentence to life imprisonment, and was not an element of capital murder, &sect; 30-20A-2.1(C) did not require that a defendant's mental retardation be proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury. The court also held that as &sect; 30-20A-2.1(C) was ambiguous as to when such a determination could be made, the statute did not prevent the determination being made pretrial if such a motion was made by defendant's request. Finally, defendant had the right to present evidence of mental retardation to the jury as a mitigating factor, but the issue had to be considered independent of other factors, and a special verdict on the issue was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's ruling was reversed, and the matter was remanded for proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant claimed the trial court committed a reversible error by excluding the testimony of two defense witnesses that may have established a third person's motive to commit the murder for which defendant was charged. Specifically, the trial court excluded testimony that the witnesses overheard the victim state that the third person owed the victim money. Defendant contended the statements were not hearsay as they were not offered to prove the existence of a debt, but as motive for the third person to kill the victim. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision. The appellate court held that while the statements were relevant, defendant made an insufficient offer of proof. The appellate court noted that had defendant established he was aware of the debt, the statements would have been admissible. However, as defendant failed to establish whether he had heard of, or was aware of, the victim's claim that the third person owed the victim money, the witnesses' statements were essentially being offered to prove the existence of the debt. Thus, the trial court did not err in excluding the statements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff retiree filed suit against defendant New Mexico Public Employees Retirement Board (PERB), alleging that N.M.

The Court of Appeals (New Mexico) affirmed the trial court's grant of PERB's motion to dismiss, and the retiree appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retiree joined a volunteer fire department at age 47 and retired 22 years later. The PERB denied his application for benefits under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-11A-2(E). The retiree's suit alleging that the VFRA violated the ADEA was dismissed based on sovereign immunity. On appeal, the court reversed. The retiree had requested only prospective injunctive relief, not money damages; therefore, the PERB's sovereign immunity claim was rejected under the Eleventh Amendment. The court noted that traditional exceptions to sovereign immunity continued in effect even under federal legislation that failed to satisfy U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 5, and that the doctrine was applicable to suits filed in state court. The ADEA remained applicable to the states, under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-11A-2(E) the retiree was denied retirement benefits due solely to his age, and his suit was dismissed based on sovereign immunity; therefore, the retiree alleged an ongoing violation of the ADEA. Also, the request for prospective injunctive relief did not implicate special state sovereignty interests. However, the retiree needed to add the PERB members individually as defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the intermediate appellate court judgment and remanded the case to the trial court to allow the retiree to move to amend his complaint to add the individual PERB members as defendants.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court noted that N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 6 was designed to establish the right of individual citizens to keep and bear arms, and to limit interference with that right. That right, however, was subject to a condition that the Constitution not protect the carrying of concealed weapons. Just as there was no constitutional right to carry concealed weapons, though, the supreme court determined that there was also no constitutional prohibition against the legislature providing so by statute. The supreme court held that if N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 6 were an absolute prohibition against carrying concealed weapons, the legislature could not have permitted it in certain instances. The supreme court concluded that under N.M. Stat.

The District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico) entered an order denying the candidate's request for a preliminary injunction and granted the State's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The candidate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The candidate, a current member of the Public Regulatory Commission (PRC), sought a declaration that he was entitled to be put on the upcoming 2004 ballot for another term as commissioner of the PRC. He was first elected to the PRC in 1998, won re-election in 2000, and at the expiration of this four-year term sought to run for a second four-year term. The New Mexico Constitution provided that after serving two terms a PRC member was ineligible to hold office until one full term had intervened, pursuant to N.M. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1. Thus, the central question of this case was whether he had served &quot;two terms&quot; as that phrase was understood by the Constitution. The reviewing court held the word &quot;term,&quot; as used in this constitutional provision, included both a full four-year term and a shortened two-year term. The candidate had thus served two terms and was ineligible to be placed on the upcoming ballot until four years had intervened. Any uncertainty as to the legislative intent behind the constitutional provision was removed by the implementing legislation,&nbsp;N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-7-4(A) (1997).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner New Mexico Judicial Standards Commission members sought a writ of quo warranto with the court seeking to stop real party in interest governor from removing the lay members of the Commission and replacing them with respondent new gubernatorial appointees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the governor was appointed, he began removing executive officers and began replacing them with his own appointees. The governor did so under the power of N.M. Const. art. V, &sect; 5. The governor attempted to remove the lay members of the Commission under this authority. The members filed this action and sought to prevent this. The court denied the petition for a writ of quo warranto. The court held that the governor's removal of Commission members was proper and not a violation of the separation of powers. The court read N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect; 32, which addressed the power to fill a vacancy, and N.M. Const. art. V, &sect; 5, which addressed the power to remove Commission members, as harmonious constitutional provisions. Without a compelling reason to hold otherwise, and in the absence of any express limit within the language of N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect; 32 and any express limit imposed by the legislature, the court had to conclude that the governor's removal power under Art. V, &sect; 5 applied to the executive appointees on the Commission. The court noted that if the legislature wanted to limit the governor's removal authority, the legislature was free to do so, but the court was not.</SPAN></P>

The instant court concluded that the commission acted within its discretion in ruling that El Cajete was a new mining unit of Las Conchas, rather than a new mining operation. The mining company's common ownership of both mines was undisputed. There were also ample facts to support the conclusion that Las Conchas and El Cajete were substantially interrelated. The commission reasonably relied on its expertise in making its determination. The permit area fixed for a given mining operation could be expanded under certain circumstances to accommodate new or expanded mining units.</SPAN></P>

The district court ordered that his good-time credits be restored and the record of the disciplinary hearing be struck from his file. The district court refused to permit the corrections department to pursue the same disciplinary issues in another hearing. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A corrections officer observed petitioner and fellow inmate struggling and fighting with a broom. The officer prepared a misconduct report, which charged petitioner with assault or battery and physical fighting. The New Mexico Department of Corrections held a disciplinary hearing in which petitioner tried to call two inmate witnesses, but the hearing officer declined to allow the inmates to testify. The hearing officer concluded that petitioner was guilty of the offense of assault or battery, but dismissed the fighting charge. The classification committee took away most of petitioner's good-time credits. The district court concluded that the hearing officer had violated petitioner's due process rights and prison policy by not allowing him to call his witnesses. The State challenged the district court's decision not allowing the Department to have another hearing. The supreme court interpreted the district court's remarks as finding that the Department had, in other cases, engaged in similar conduct and that a sanction was appropriate as an exceptional remedy for the exceptional circumstances. Thus, the district court acted within its discretion to fashion an appropriate remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners secured title insurance through the company. After a dispute arose concerning the policy's coverage, the landowners filed an action against the company for breach of contract and good faith and fair dealing. The landowners also asserted statutory claims for unfair insurance practices and unfair trade practices. The district court stayed the action pending arbitration, but the appellate court reversed that order. The court agreed with the appellate court that the landowners could not be said to have consented to the arbitration clause in the policy. The decision to arbitrate the disputes could not be voluntarily accepted or rejected because it was required by law. Because the landowners' purchase of the policy, which had terms mandated by statute, was not the equivalent of a voluntary contractual agreement, the landowners did not waive their right to have factual issues that were triable to a jury at common law at the time of statehood resolved by a jury in the case. The public rights doctrine did not apply to these facts. The court held that the regulation requiring arbitration violated the landowners' right to a trial by jury and was unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In support of the citizen's petition, the citizen argued, inter alia, that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 29-18-1 to -12 (2001) violated N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 6, because it permitted local governments to regulate an incident of the right to bear arms. The appellate court agreed with the citizen and issued a writ of mandamus. The Concealed Handgun Carry Act purported to allow municipalities and counties to prohibit the carrying of concealed weapons and, in so doing, delegated to them the power to regulate an incident of the right to keep and bear arms. The broad language in N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 6 prohibiting municipalities and counties from regulating an incident of the right to keep and bear arms in any way indicated the intent to preclude piecemeal administration at a local level and to ensure uniformity in the regulation of firearms throughout New Mexico. Thus the Act directly conflicted with the state constitution, and therefore, the Act was unconstitutional. Further, the Section 29-18-11(D) of the Act could not be severed without frustrating the legislative intent, and therefore, the Act as a whole was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed the trial court and concluded that the clear intent and purpose of the city ordinance was to establish a remedial measure to protect the public from those drivers who persisted in driving after license revocation and multiple driving while intoxicated offenses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty, and the transcript of his plea hearing was subsequently lost.

The supreme court ruled that the acceptance of that deficient waiver constituted a fundamental error. Defendant's guilty plea stood, but the transcript of that plea had to be reconstructed in accordance with the following instructions: (1) defendant must be present at the new reconstruction hearing; and (2) the trial judge may not preside over the hearing, but may testify. The presiding judge would determine whether the reconstructed record affirmatively demonstrated that the original plea was voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently entered, in accordance with N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for first-degree depraved-mind murder on either a principal or accessory liability theory. The supreme court disagreed. The evidence showed that the defendant and his friend were standing on the second floor balcony and opened fire at a group of rival gang members below. According to a witness, the defendant shot at the victim first and then let his friend shoot two other people. A detective testified that the witness identified the defendant from a photo lineup as one of the shooters. He also identified the defendant as one of the shooters from a photo lineup performed by the detective and again positively identified the defendant as one of the shooters at trial. Therefore, a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's act of shooting into the crowd caused the victim's death.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 43-1-15(B), the guardian appointment hearing was only five days late; (4) the alternative remedy of filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus provided an adequate safeguard for a violation of the patient's rights; and (5) dismissal of the petition was not a proper remedy for a procedural violation of the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code, N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner child filed a motion to suppress evidence arguing a police officer questioned him without advising him of his basic rights under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32A-1-14 (1993). The children's court held the child's Miranda rights were not violated because there was no custodial interrogation. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (New Mexico) agreed with the lower court. The instant court granted the child's petition for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police officers were dispatched to an apartment where teenagers were having a party. One officer asked a 15 year-old child to accompany him to the hallway where he questioned the teenager, who admitted to consuming two beers. The officer did not recall telling the child he was not free to leave.  N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32A-2-14 (1993) provided that prior to questioning, a child who was detained had to be advised of his right to remain silent, and that any statements made could be used against the child. The court of appeals held there was no violation of the child's right to Miranda warnings, as he was never in custody, there was no custodial interrogation, and that &sect; 32A-2-14, which required advising a child of his basic rights, was nothing more than a codification of Miranda. In its reversal, the supreme court found &sect; 32A-2-14 evinced a legislative intent to expand the rights of children beyond those rights embodied in Miranda jurisprudence. Thus, the child did not have to be under custodial interrogation to trigger the protections of the statute. Rather, the protections of the statute were triggered when the child was subjected to the investigatory detention.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decision of the lower court finding that the child's statements were admissible was reversed and the child's adjudication of delinquency was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The contestants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Errors by a county clerk on ballots, including omitting a candidate's name, caused enough invalid votes to be cast in a precinct to have affected the outcome of the election. Although the affected terms of office had expired, rendering the case moot, the state supreme court found the argument by the contestants that the election was not &quot;free and open,&quot; as required under N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 8, and arguably requiring a new election, raised issues of substantial public interest which were capable of repetition and would otherwise evade review. The contestants had standing to assert the rights of third party voters. Although the Election Code set out the exclusive procedure for contesting the results of an election, the contest grounds and remedies could be found outside the Code. The court held that the omission deprived some voters of that choice, so a constitutional violation occurred, but that holding a new election was an unsatisfactory remedy, due to the cost, relative uncertainty of result, and unfairness to the candidates. Thus, the court drew an analogy to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-14-13, which applied to errors by precinct boards, and rejected the votes in the precinct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered the votes in the affected precinct to be rejected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A federal border patrol agent seized marijuana from defendant. Defendant's claim that the search and seizure violated his rights under the federal Constitution was rejected. The detention constituted a routine border checkpoint stop and was not excessive in scope or duration. However, the extra layer of protection from unreasonable searches and seizures involving automobiles was a distinct characteristic of New Mexico constitutional law. New Mexico's requirement that reasonable suspicion justify a prolonged border checkpoint stop applied to the federal agent for purposes of determining the admissibility of evidence in state court. The federal agent did not possess the requisite reasonable suspicion to prolong defendant's detention. Defendant's consent to the search was tainted by the unlawfully prolonged detention, and all evidence thereby seized was inadmissible in state court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant petitioned for certiorari to vacate his sentence imposed after his conviction for trafficking in a controlled substance, claiming that the sentencing judge evinced a harsh predisposition when sentencing defendants who elected to have their guilt or innocence decided by a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was tried and convicted by a jury of trafficking in a controlled substance. The trial judge announced that it was the general policy of the court that if a person was found guilty of a crime by a jury, the statutory penalty was imposed. The words &quot;by a jury&quot; were uttered clearly and intentionally by the judge. The Supreme Court held that a court violated a defendant's constitutional rights by imposing a harsher sentence merely because the defendant pleaded not guilty and exercised his right to a jury trial. By upholding defendant's constitutional rights the court was protecting the rights of other defendants who were faced with similar choices in the future. Defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI were impermissibly infringed upon by the trial judge. The court concluded that in sentencing defendant the prior remarks of the trial judge indicated it improperly considered the defendant's exercise of his constitutional right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county, challenged the final order of appellee, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, extending implementation dates for franchise fee charges. Because appellant had no right of appeal under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 62-11-1, the court treated appellant's notice of appeal as a petition for writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee granted utilities a delay in the implementation of franchise fee adjustments, which appellant asserted was contrary to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 62-3A-18(A) (1999). Appellee, relying on N.M. Stat. Ann. 1978 &sect; 62-3A-4(D) to grant its delay, had found utilities could not comply with the new law without making rate adjustments; many of them included franchise fees in their base rates. The threshold question, answered in the negative, was whether it was appropriate for the court to exercise its original jurisdiction in mandamus. Concluding appellee reasonably found utilities could not alter franchise fee billing without modifying rates, appellee, when presented with conflicting statutes,&nbsp;&sect;&sect; 62-8-7(B), 62-3A-18(A), attempted to interpret them harmoniously, relying on language in &sect; 62-3A-4(D), which authorized the delay dates. Such action was not properly the subject of mandamus, and did not justify the court's exercise of original jurisdiction in mandamus, so appellant's petition was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's petition for writ of mandamus was denied. Appellee's extension of implementation dates for franchise fee charges did not intrude upon the province of the legislature and thus did not implicate a fundamental constitutional question of great public importance necessary for the court to exercise original mandamus jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 31-20A-1 to -6. The court reversed. The court upheld the CFSA, the jury instructions, and the introduction of victim impact testimony during the penalty phase. The evidence was sufficient to support the aggravating circumstance of murder during the commission of a kidnapping. However, evidence of defendant's lack of remorse created a possibility that the jury voted for the death penalty under the influence of an improper factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners appealed the ruling of the New Mexico Court of Appeals, which reversed trial court awards of compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney fees against individual respondents, but affirmed compensatory damages against respondent school district, in petitioners' claims brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for violations of their rights under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, two high school students, sued respondents school district and four school officials under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 after petitioners were strip searched in an attempt to recover another student's missing ring. A jury awarded compensatory damages against the district and the officials, punitive damages against three of the officials, and attorney fees. The court of appeals affirmed the compensatory damages against respondent school district, but reversed all judgments against the individual respondents. The court reversed in part and affirmed in part, reinstating all trial court judgments except attorney fees, which required further documentation. The strip-to-undergarments search of one petitioner violated his clearly established rights, and the school officials were not entitled to qualified immunity for that search. The jury instruction on the pre-search detention, which broke the search claim into two separate theories, was improper but harmless. Evidence that two respondents acted intentionally and with utter indifference supported the award of punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-The exclusion violated the workers' rights to equal protection because there was nothing rational about a law that excluded from worker's compensation benefits employees who harvested crops from the field while providing benefits for the employees who sorted and bagged the same crop; [2]-Farm and ranch laborers seeking compensation were similarly situated to other workers in the State who were likewise seeking compensation since both groups consisted of workers suffering work-related injuries or disabilities who were in need of indemnity and medical benefits; [3]-The stated purpose of the Act was not served by creating classifications among the State's workers.</SPAN></P>

II, &sect; 10 because although the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant, the State made no showing of exigent circumstances to support the arrest; [3]-The inevitable discovery doctrine did not apply because an anticipated subsequent inventory search was not wholly independent of the illegal arrest.</SPAN></P>

The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's kidnapping conviction, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-4-1(B), and the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.

The goodwill developed by in-store activities promoting the taxpayer's website and by consumers' increased awareness of the taxpayer due to the presence of in-state stores, helped to establish and maintain a market in New Mexico for the taxpayer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of San Juan County, New Mexico, affirmed appellee State of New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department, Motor Vehicle Division's (MVD) revocation of appellant driver's license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver argued that the MVD did not have the statutory authority to consider whether a stop was supported by reasonable suspicion and that only the district court had jurisdiction to consider the issue. The appellate court noted that it elected to treat the driver's notice of appeal as a timely petition for writ of certiorari since it was filed within twenty days of the district court's order. A traffic stop that complied with Fourth Amendment requirements was not a necessary element of a license revocation under the Implied Consent Act (Act), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 66-8-105 to -112 (2010). The appellate court agreed with the MVD that the Act required a hearing officer to determine whether a law enforcement officer had reasonable grounds to believe that a driver was DWI, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-8-112(F)(1), and that this determination was similar to a determination of whether probable cause supported an arrest. However, this determination did not include a determination regarding the reasonableness of the stop preceding the arrest. The exclusionary rule was inapplicable in an MVD proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner and respondent were in a committed relationship for several years. Respondent adopted a child from Russia and the parties raised the child together for nine years until their relationship ended. On appeal, the court held that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-4-9.1(K) (1999) limited standing in a custody case to natural and adoptive parents and, as a result, denied petitioner standing to bring her custody claim. The court further held that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-11-5(A) (2008) of the Uniform Parentage Act, which presumed that a father was the natural father under certain circumstances, did not apply to women and, therefore, did not establish natural parenthood in petitioner sufficient to grant her standing. The court additionally held, however, that the equitable power of the courts mandated a consideration of the best interests of the child, and therefore, if the allegations in the petition were proven, the best interests of the child could accord petitioner standing to assert her claim for visitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed insofar as it held that &sect; 40-7-9.1(K) denied petitioner standing for visitation, and the case was remanded to determine the best interests of the child and whether petitioner had standing to seek visitation.

Because plaintiff did not present expert testimony to establish the standard of care, the appellate court reversed the compensatory damages and punitive damages awarded based on the negligent hiring claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of Socorro County, New Mexico, overturned portions of two regulations promulgated by appellant New Mexico State Engineer, N.M. Code R.19.25.13.27 (2004) and 19.25.13.30 (2004), because it found that they impermissibly expanded the scope of the State Engineer's statutory authority and violated due process protections. The State Engineer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court noted that the separation of powers issue was the nature and reach of the legislative authority which the State Engineer argued permitted him to adopt the Active Water Resource Management (AWRM) Regulations. The State Engineer argued that the Legislature redirected his power in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-2-9.1, such that although his exercise of the power under the AWRM regulations may be different in application, it was not different in kind. The appellate court found that the Legislature did not intend &sect; 72-2-9.1 to provide the State Engineer with the additional power of determining water right priorities as among water rights owners and to curtail water usage based upon such administrative determinations. The State Engineer was not authorized to make determinations beyond adjudication decrees and licenses necessary to carry out the AWRM regulations. The State Engineer could adopt rules for priority administration based on the existing authority to administer water allocations. Even if the Legislature had intended that the State Engineer adopt a regulation such as N.M. Code R. 19.25.13.27, it did not provide the statutory framework for the State Engineer to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed as to the limitation of N.M. Code R. 19.25.13.27 to court adjudication decrees and licenses issued by the State Engineer; the judgment was reversed as to the conclusion that subfile orders and offers of judgment filed in adjudication cases may be considered in the application of Rule 19.25.13.27.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of San Miguel County, New Mexico, dismissed the State of New Mexico's motion to revoke defendant's probation for failure to meet the time limits of N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested on a probation violation on September 11, 2007. The district attorney did not file a motion to revoke probation until November 19, 2007; in excess of the five-day requirement of N.M. R. Ann. 5-805(F). The initial hearing was not held until January 28, 2008, exceeding the thirty-day time limit from the filing of the motion to revoke probation of N.M. R. Ann. 5-805(G). The district court acted properly by dismissing the motion to revoke probation, because the time limits of Rule 5-805 had expired before the district court had the opportunity to hold the adjudicatory hearing. Rule 5-805 did not infringe upon the legislature's exclusive role in establishing the substantive law. The Supreme Court of New Mexico had the clear right to establish procedures to prevent delay in court proceedings. N.M. R. Ann. 5-805 provided the procedural framework to ensure the speedy resolution of the legislatively granted substantive rights. It did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. Because the district court's disposition was not contrary to law, the State had no right to appeal under N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of Bernalillo County, New Mexico, concluded that defendant failed to show that an unlicensed person's participation in metropolitan court prejudiced defendant and that the State had established that the roadblock was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that because the unlicensed person was neither a peace officer nor a governmental employee, he was not permitted to prosecute defendant. The appellate court found that because the metropolitan court was a magistrate court, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-8A-2 (1980), and because non-lawyers were permitted to practice law in magistrate courts, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 36-2-27 (1999), the Legislature had expressly granted nonlawyers the ability to practice law in metropolitan court. The unlicensed person was not barred by N.M. R. Ann. 7-108 from participating in the prosecution initiated and controlled by the State. The metropolitan court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the roadblock as it was free to rely on the police officer's testimony regarding the limits placed on the field officers' discretion. Defendant did not argue that the limits the officer placed on the field officers' discretion were insufficient, nor did he attack any other aspects of the roadblock.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was prosecuted for negligent child abuse, pleaded guilty, received a conditional discharge, and successfully completed probation. Defendant was denied two employment opportunities based on her criminal record and petitioned for an expungement order. The district court entered the order after finding that exceptional circumstances warranted expungement. The Court of Appeals of New Mexico reversed. The conditional discharge statute,&nbsp;N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-20-13, did not implicitly grant the district court the authority to order the expungement of defendant's criminal records upon her successful completion of probation. The district court could, however, exercise its inherent power to expunge arrest records in extraordinary circumstances. Because defendant had only suffered the loss of future employment prospects, a harm that was the natural consequence of her arrest, she failed to demonstrate the extraordinary circumstances necessary to justify expungement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court of Valencia County, New Mexico, convicted defendant of his third offense of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DWI), pursuant to a violation of City of Rio Rancho, N.M., Municipal Code, Rev. Ordinances ch. VI, art. VI &sect; 12.1 (2007) (Ordinance). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the city exceeded its authority by enacting the Ordinance because it unconstitutionally limited his right to a jury trial. He contended that by providing a lesser penalty than provided under the state DWI statutes, the Ordinance was void because it was inconsistent with state law. The appellate court noted that the parties did not dispute the fact that the Ordinance prohibited exactly the same acts as those prohibited by the state DWI statutes. The only substantive difference was the penalty imposed. The Ordinance was not inconsistent with the laws of New Mexico because it did not permit an act prohibited by the general law or vice versa. A home municipality was free to impose any penalty for DWI that complied with the restrictions defined in N.M. Const. art. X, &sect; 6D and N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-17-1(C)(2). Defendant was not entitled to a jury trial in district court. It was the intent of the Legislature to specifically permit municipalities to enact DWI ordinances. Defendant was not entitled to Miranda warnings prior to being advised and tested, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-8-107(B), as officer's questioning of defendant was not testimonial in nature.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the contract at issue did not pledge mill levy proceeds for anything other than the performance of a health care facilities contract for a hospital located in New Mexico. The Board did not exceed the authority granted to it by the Hospital Funding Act. The language of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4-48B-3(G) neither stated nor implied that the physical facilities needed to be in existence at the time the contract was executed or that, absent physical facilities, a contracting hospital did not exist. The contract provided for termination and N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4-48B-5(J)(2) allowed for this type of limitation.
