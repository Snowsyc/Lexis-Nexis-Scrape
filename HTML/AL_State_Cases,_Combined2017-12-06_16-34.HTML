The State argued that the trial court exceeded the scope of Ala. R. Crim. P. 20.3 by setting aside the jury's verdict for grounds other than the sufficiency of the evidence. The court found that the constitutionality of statute was an issue that should have been challenged in a pretrial motion pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 15.4. As the trial court's ruling did not address the sufficiency of the evidence to convict defendant, but rather the constitutionality of the statute, it exceeded the scope of Rule 20.3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to establishing a residence where a minor resides in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-26(c) of the Community Notification Act (CNA), Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-20 et seq., but he expressly reserved the right to appeal the decision of the Jefferson Circuit Court, Alabama, which denied his pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that &sect; 15-20-26(c)(3) and (4) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had been convicted of molesting a 10-year old niece while she was residing with him. He argued &sect; 15-20-26(c)(3) and (4) violated his rights to due process and equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV as they prohibited him from residing with his biological children. Although defendant had a fundamental right to parent his children, the court applied a strict scrutiny analysis and held that &sect; 15-20-26(c)(3) and (4) did not unconstitutionally infringe upon his due process or equal protection rights as they were narrowly tailored to serve the compelling state interest of protecting children. The CNA did not contain a blanket prohibition preventing sex offenders from residing with their minor children. Rather, defendant belonged to a limited subset of offenders who were treated equally under the CNA; offenders victimized a child under 12 years old or a minor who was living with the offender. There was no less restrictive alternative to protecting children from sex offenders under the Alabama Juvenile Justice Act, Ala. Code &sect; 12-15-101 et seq., as it was limited to only those children under a juvenile court's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a municipal court for failure to register a septic tank under Tuscaloosa Municipal Code, Ala., &sect; 13-51(3) and (16). He appealed to the Tuscaloosa Circuit Court, Alabama, which again convicted of him of failing to register a septic tank and ordered him to pay a fine. He sought review, claiming a city was without authority to enact &sect; 13-51 and it violated due process and equal protection principles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that in enacting &sect; 13-51(3), the city was engaging in a governmental function within its statutory police powers, and not a proprietary function as defendant argued. The legislature did not intend to preempt the entire field of wastewater regulation by providing a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of septic tanks by the Alabama Onsite Wastewater Board under Ala. Code &sect; 34-21A-1 et seq., and by the State Board of Health under Ala. Code &sect; 22-26-1 et seq. Ala. Code &sect; 34A-21A-10 provided the licensing requirements of the Onsite Wastewater Board did not apply to residential homeowners and Ala. Admin. Code r. 420-3-1-.104 provided that approval by the State Board of Health was not to be construed as approval by a municipality. The registration requirement under &sect; 13-51(3) was rationally related to protecting a lake within the city's jurisdiction from contaminants from leaking septic tanks and did not violate principles of due process or equal protection. The disclosure risks of &sect; 13-51 did not pose a substantial hazard of self-incrimination as the registration requirement itself did not require defendant to admit to anything inherently criminal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Colbert Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him of capital murder for the intentional murder of his victim by stabbing him during the course of a first-degree robbery in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant and his wife had been using illegal narcotics for several days, they called the victim and told him to come to their apartment so that he could be paid for drugs that they had previously obtained from him. Defendant then planned to rob and kill the victim, which he did with the help of his wife. Defendant was sentenced to death. During the penalty phase of the trial, the jury, by a vote of 8 to 4, recommended life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The trial court overrode the jury's recommendation, finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. The circuit court's order did not clearly state that it found the jury's recommendation to be a mitigating circumstance and did not contain written findings concerning what weight the jury recommendation was given. Thus, the court remanded the case to the trial court for it to amend its sentencing order to clarify its findings regarding the judicial override. The trial court was ordered to reweigh the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating circumstances and resentence defendant and state how it considered the jury's advisory verdict and the weight it was accorded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Blount Circuit Court (Alabama) of one count of unlawful transport of articles containing sounds transferred without the consent of the owner, a violation of Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction because the State failed to present evidence showing that the copyrighted material contained on the disks was transferred without the consent of owner in that a representative from the trade organizations who testified for the State at trial was not an &quot;owner&quot; under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-80 or one &quot;authorized to maintain custody and control over business records reflecting consent&quot; under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-81(a)(e). The court of criminal appeals disagreed. The representative testified that the disks were not made pursuant to industry standards in that they were &quot;burned&quot; onto a disk as opposed to being &quot;pressed&quot; into the disk. None of the disks were packaged in a manner consistent with industry practice, and no disk was accompanied by the artwork or information generally associated with typical commercial reproduction. The State also presented evidence indicating that defendant was involved with the buying and selling of the reproductions. The evidence gave rise to the inference that defendant was operating with the knowledge that his activities were taking place without the consent of the owners.</SPAN></P>

The court of criminal appeals disagreed. Although the State used two peremptory strikes to remove two of the three African-Americans remaining on the venire, that fact did not establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination. The record did not reflect, and defendant did not argue, that the two African-Americans struck by the State shared only the characteristic of race, that anything in the type or manner of the State's statements or questions during voir dire examination indicated an intent to discriminate against African-American jurors, that there was a lack of meaningful voir dire directed at African-American jurors, or that African-American jurors and Caucasian jurors were treated differently. With nothing more than an attenuated history of improper peremptory challenges, it could not be said that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant's Batson motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State of Alabama sought review of an order of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) dismissing an indictment of defendant and declaring unconstitutional that portion of former Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-22(a)(1) in the Community Notification Act (CNA), Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-20 et seq., that required an adult criminal sex offender to provide, prior to release from custody, the actual address at which he or she would reside or live upon release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, an adult criminal sex offender, was arrested on his scheduled prison release date and indicted for failing to meet the anticipated address reporting requirement of former Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-22(a)(1). The court held that the statute violated the guarantee to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and in Ala. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 6, and 22, because it resulted in an unreasonable and discriminatory classification based on wealth. The statute also was unconstitutional as applied to defendant under the Eighth Amendment and under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. The requirement in former &sect; 15-20-22(a)(1) that a sex offender provide an actual address at which he or she would reside punished defendant solely for his status of being homeless. The charge for violating the reporting provision of the CNA was a felony, and indigent offenders thus could eventually be sentenced as habitual felons to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole solely because they had no funds to secure a place to stay upon their release from prison. Thus, as applied to this defendant, &sect; 15-20-22(a)(1) constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court dismissing the indictment of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of capital murder for the intentional murder of one victim by shooting him in the course of a first-degree robbery, and for the intentional murder of the second victim by shooting him inside a vehicle. The trial court sentenced defendant to death following the jury's 8-4 advisory verdict of life imprisonment without parole. The appellate court affirmed the convictions and sentence. Because the investigator did not interrogate defendant until he had indicated that he understood his rights and chose to waive them, there was no constitutional violation of his right to counsel and his statement was properly admitted. Defendant also failed to make a prima facie showing of discrimination by the State in striking the jury and there was no plain error resulting from the admission into evidence of a wedding photograph and the identification by his widow of the victim in the photograph. There was also no showing, through the voir dire examination, of actual prejudice, nor was there any showing that the community was so saturated with pretrial publicity that defendant was prevented from receiving a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought review of the decision of the Shelby Circuit Court (Alabama), which granted, in part, the inmate's postconviction petition attacking his capital-murder conviction and sentence of death. The inmate filed a cross-appeal from the circuit court's partial denial of claims in his postconviction petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed the order that granted, in part, the inmate's postconviction petition attacking his capital-murder conviction and sentence of death. The inmate cross-appealed the partial denial of his claims in his postconviction petition. The supreme court affirmed the judgment granting Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 relief in part. The judgment was reversed insofar as it held that the inmate could not have been sentenced to death because his codefendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The inmate was denied the effective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase of his capital-murder trial because counsel failed to investigate and present mitigating evidence. Counsel's investigation was so inadequate that they failed to discover any mitigation evidence to present at the penalty phase, although the R. 32 evidentiary hearing clearly showed that there was a plethora of evidence that could have been presented on the inmate's behalf. The circuit court erred in finding that the inmate's death sentence was improper because it was constitutionally disproportionate and excessive to his codefendant's sentence of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court reversed the judgment insofar as it held that the inmate could not be sentenced to death merely because his codefendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The case was remanded to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with the opinion and the remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of four counts of capital murder and sentenced to death. Following the circuit court's denial of defendant's Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition, the appellate court dismissed the appeal. The Alabama Supreme Court reversed the dismissal of the appeal and remanded for the appellate court to consider the circuit court's denial of the Rule 32 petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the parties agreed that certain claims remained pending after the circuit court entered the orders of partial dismissal, so the appellate court remanded the cause for resolution of those pending claims. The court rejected defendant's remaining challenges to his conviction and sentence. The adoption of the State's proposed orders partially dismissing claims was not error and did not warrant reversal; the orders required an analysis of defendant's petition and the State's answer, along with the record from the trial and the direct appeal, and they were not based on the any alleged personal knowledge or observations garnered by the judge during the trial. Even if a cumulative-effect analysis were required by Alabama law, that factor would not have eliminated defendant's obligation to plead each claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in compliance with the directives of Ala. R. Crim. P. 32. Defendant's cursory summary of the allegations of the petition did not comport with Ala. R. Crim. P. 28(a)(10). Because the primary method of execution in Alabama was then lethal injection, Ala. Code &sect; 15-18-82(a), defendant's argument about electrocution was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the cause to the circuit court for resolution of those claims that the parties agreed had not been dismissed by the orders of partial dismissal, and it affirmed the remaining parts of the judgment of conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) convicting him, upon a jury's verdict, of four counts of capital murder, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2), (10), and overriding the jury's recommendation of life in prison and instead sentencing him to death on all four counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and another took the lives of three people during the course of a robbery. He was also convicted of an additional count of capital murder under &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(10) because two or more people were murdered pursuant to one course of conduct. Although the jury recommended life by a vote of 10-2, the trial court's override of the recommendation under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-47(d) did not violate Ala. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9, 15, or U.S. Const. amends. V, VI, VIII, or XIV. The judicial-override provision did not result in the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. The capital sentencing procedure ensured that the trial judge was given adequate information and sufficient guidance in deciding whether to accept the jury's recommendation, and Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-53 provided sufficient guidelines for an appellate determination of whether the trial judge's override was appropriate. Further, the trial court clearly set forth its reasons for overriding the recommendation, expressly stating that the jury's recommendation weighed heavily in favor of defendant. Finally, the trial court's consideration of additional facts in weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Lawrence Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him of capital murder committed during the course of an arson in violation of Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction of murder made capital because it was committed during the course of an arson and his sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. The appellate court affirmed, stating that considering defendant's age and his crime, his sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for capital murder was not categorically disproportionate. Defendant committed the worst crime recognized in Alabama, capital murder, and, solely because of his age, was not eligible for the harshest penalty. Further, assuming, without deciding, that the State failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that an expert was an expert in blood-spatter analysis, any error in allowing her testimony regarding what could have caused the blood spatter on defendant's shirt was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the testimony was cumulative. Even if the admission of defendant's statement was erroneous, the error was harmless because the statement, at most, helped to link him to the stolen cards; however, defendant's connection to the cards was also established by his formal statement to the investigator in which he admitted stealing the cards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of three counts of capital murder for murdering the victim during the course of a robbery, during the course of a burglary, and for causing the victim's death by firing a shot from outside a dwelling into a dwelling. The jury recommended life in prison, but the circuit court sentenced defendant to death. The appellate court affirmed, stating that the circuit court committed no error in failing to remove the challenged jurors for cause under Ala. Code &sect; 12-16-150. Further, the State articulated a facially race-neutral reason for removing another juror and defendant failed to rebut or show that the reason was merely pretextual. The circuit court did not err in failing to suppress defendant's statement to Texas law-enforcement personnel because the statements were voluntary. Defendant's convictions were appropriate based on his own admissions indicating that he was present when his codefendant fired the fatal shot, that defendant was ready to assist the codefendant if necessary, that defendant's participation in the events was significant, and that he supported the codefendant in his murder of the victim and covered up the murder.</SPAN></P>

After his motion for a new trial and/or reconsideration of sentence was denied, he appealed, but the circuit court's judgment was affirmed. The circuit court did not commit plain error in allowing a police department dispatcher to testify about two telephone calls that she received from the victim's uncle since the dispatcher's testimony that the uncle told her that the victims had possibly been killed was not offered to show the truth of the matter asserted under Ala. R. Evid. 801(c), but only to show why the officers went to the home and how they discovered the bodies. Defendant also failed to demonstrate specific, actual prejudice to his defense because of any delay and therefore, he failed to prove any speedy-trial violation. There was no indication that the delay actually hampered the defense. After reviewing the prosecutor's comments in context, they were simply permissible comments on defendant's guilt that were based on the evidence. Also, the prosecutor did not improperly encourage the jury to convict defendant based on reasons or information outside the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Further because the collage or montage evidence contained genital nudity, which amounted to child pornography, it was afforded no protection under U.S. Const. amend. I. The First Amendment did not protect pornography involving actual children. Additionally, the statutes under which defendant was convicted, Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13A-12-192(b), -197, did not violate the First Amendment. Finally, the collage or montage exhibits were properly admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from Covington Circuit Court, Alabama, where he was convicted, in part, of three counts of capital murder pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a) in connection with the death of one victim. Following the jury's recommendation, the circuit court sentenced defendant to death on the three capital-murder convictions. The murder took place as part of a crime spree following defendant's escape from a county jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant first contended that the State improperly split the single crime of escape into multiple counts in the indictment, which, he claimed, resulted in multiple convictions for the same conduct in violation of the prohibition against double jeopardy. Affirming, the court found no abuse of discretion in the circuit court's denial of the motion to sever on the ground that all the charged offenses were part of a continuous effort by defendant to elude capture, i.e., that the crimes were connected in their commission and/or they were all part of a common scheme or plan, pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 13.3(a)(2) and (3). Defendant's additional arguments were also rejected. The court found no merit in defendant's contention that the circuit court erred in denying his motion for a change of venue due to prejudicial pretrial publicity. As for the argument that his confession was not voluntarily rendered because it was induced by the coercive conditions of his confinement, the circuit court's finding on the conflicting evidence was not contrary to the great weight of the evidence or manifestly wrong.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate sought review of the decision of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which denied one of his postconviction petitions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. He currently appealed the denial of one of his petitions for postconviction relief, but the appellate court affirmed. The circuit court set forth in detail its reasons for making the credibility choices that it made in determining that the inmate had not established that there was newly discovered evidence providing a basis for postconviction relief; the circuit court did not exceed its discretion in denying the petition. The inmate argued that the circuit court erred in concluding that the DNA test results proved that an individual's confession was false. However, there was ample non-DNA evidence to support the finding that the individual's affidavit that he was the murderer was not credible and that, therefore, it did not constitute newly discovered evidence. Further, because the results of a rape kit were known to the inmate at the time of his trial and because the availability of the rape kit would not have altered the result of his trial or established his innocence, he failed to meet his burden of showing that those facts constituted newly discovered evidence under Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.1(e).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction entered by the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama) for capital murder for the intentional murder of the victim by the use of a deadly weapon while she was in a vehicle, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(17) and his resulting sentence of death. Defendant asserted numerous arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">None of defendant's allegations of suggestive techniques used by the police was supported by the record. Neither the cited discrepancies in the witnesses' descriptions nor the differences in the descriptions in their original statements and those in their testimony at trial discredited their identifications. As the indictment properly mentioned the prior convictions, the trial court's instructions to the jury, in which the judge read the indictment and charged as to the requisite proof of the elements of the charged offenses, were also proper. The prior convictions were admissible as the State had to prove there was a criminal proceeding involving the victim as a witness that precipitated the murder. As the prior offenses were properly charged in the indictment as the factual basis of an element of the offense, it was incumbent upon the State to prove them. Further, the convictions were relevant as they were also introduced to prove motive and intent. Because a rational basis existed for making the intentional killing of a victim who was inside a vehicle a capital offense, defendant's claim of unreasonableness was meritless. Moreover, the statute was not overly broad or too vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate sought review of an order from the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which denied his action filed under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Ala. Code &sect; 6-6-220 et seq., seeking a declaration that defendants, State of Alabama and various public officials (State), had improperly and unconstitutionally interpreted and applied Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(18).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate initially appealed to the Court of Civil Appeals of Alabama. That court transferred the appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court transferred the appeal back to that court, the Court of Civil Appeals then transferred the appeal to the court. Upon review, the court noted that the inmate's sole request for relief was a judgment declaring that the State had been unconstitutionally interpreting &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(18). The inmate's action was not a Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition challenging his conviction or sentence. A declaratory-judgment action was, by its nature, a civil action, not a postconviction writ in a criminal case. Therefore, the court had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal from a declaratory-judgment action under Ala. Const. art. VI, &sect; 141(a) and Ala. Code &sect; 12-3-9. Finally, the court determined that the matter had to be transferred back to the Court of Civil Appeals rather than the Supreme Court as the Supreme Court had previously deflected the matter to the Court of Civil Appeals under Ala. Code &sect; 12-1-4.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of murdering her 4-month-old son, an offense defined as capital by Ala.

Also, at the end of the last statement appellant stated she was not threatened or coerced. There was no abuse of discretion in allowing the prosecutor to use a baby doll as a demonstrative aid during appellant's cross-examination so she could demonstrate her version of the events leading to her son's death. Alabama's method of performing lethal injection was not cruel and unusual. The case was remanded for the circuit court to make specific findings of fact concerning each aggravating circumstance set out in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-49, and to make specific findings of facts consistent with the requirements of Ex parte Kyzer concerning the aggravating circumstances set out in &sect; 13A-5-49(8).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At his third trial, appellant was convicted of two counts of capital murder for the intentional killing of the victim during the course of a first-degree burglary, Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's specific arguments raised on appeal addressed conflicts in the evidence, which were properly weighed and evaluated by the trial court as the finder of fact. Therefore, the trial court did not err in determining appellant was not mentally retarded for Atkins purposes. The sentencing order addressed all that was required, although it did not list or find any nonstatutory mitigating circumstances. The jury was charged as to every statutory mitigating circumstance and charged that it could consider any aspect of appellant's character or record. The trial court was not required to recognize a nonstatutory mitigating circumstance where no evidence was presented at sentencing as to its existence, nor was any such nonstatutory mitigating circumstance argued by appellant as to any impact it might have in his sentencing. The circumstances of the victim's murder supported a finding that the murder occurred during a burglary and robbery and each aggravating circumstance should apply to appellant's sentencing. The death sentence was neither disproportionate nor excessive to the penalties imposed in similar cases, considering the circumstances surrounding the crime and appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Calhoun Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him of murder, a Class A felony, and sentenced him to 120 years in the State penitentiary pursuant to the Habitual Felony Offender Act, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-9(b)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the circuit court abused its discretion when it denied his request for a continuance to secure the testimony of an inmate, who defendant argued could have testified that he overheard an accomplice tell someone that the accomplice was responsible for the victim's death. The court of criminal appeals held that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request to delay the trial in order to transport the inmate from a correctional facility. Defendant failed to establish that the inmate's testimony would be admissible. He offered no explanation as to how the inmate's testimony fit within any exception to the hearsay rule. The statement was not offered against a party as required under Ala. R. Evid. 801(d)(2) but was offered in the defense. The court of criminal appeals concluded that defendant's sentence exceeded the limits set by statute. It read &sect; 13A-5-9(a)(3) in conjunction with Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-6(a)(1), which stated that sentences for a Class A felony could be for life or not more than 99 years or less than 10 years. Therefore, the only sentences available for defendant were either 99 years' imprisonment or life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of criminal appeals remanded the case to the circuit court with direction to resentence defendant in accordance with the terms set out in the opinion.</SPAN></P>

There was no evidence that the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of any passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor. The trial court's findings concerning the aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances were supported by the record. Further, the court independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating circumstances, and concurred with the trial court's conclusion that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, and death was the proper sentence in this case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the Colbert Circuit Court (Alabama), where he was convicted of capital murder pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(7) and was sentenced to death. The circuit judge held a separate sentencing hearing according to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-47 and found that defendant's murder of his wife was committed for pecuniary gain, an aggravating circumstance defined in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-49(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In his brief on appeal, defendant raised more than twenty issues in a cursory fashion. After addressing each of the arguments, the court, as required by Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-53, examined the propriety of defendant's conviction for capital murder--specifically, the murder of his wife for pecuniary gain--and his sentence of death. Affirming, the court determined that defendant's sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. The circuit court found as an aggravating circumstance, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-49(6), that the murder was committed for pecuniary gain. The only statutory mitigating circumstance was that defendant had no significant history of prior criminal activity. The circuit court found as nonstatutory mitigating circumstances that defendant had a difficult family history and had an antisocial disorder. After an independent weighing of the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating circumstances, the court stated that it was convinced, that death was the appropriate sentence for the crime and noted that a sentence of death had been imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murdering two people in the course of an arson, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(9). Defendant failed to meet his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that juror misconduct caused him prejudice. Further, defendant's several allegations that his attorneys were ineffective were without merit. The attorneys' performance was not deficient simply because they did not present cumulative evidence. Further, any alleged conflicts of interest did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance because they did not create actual conflicts of interest nor did they adversely affect the attorneys' representation. The doctrine of collateral estoppel did not bar review of whether or not defendant was mentally retarded. A review of defendant's trial testimony showed that he was clear and articulate on the stand, even during a vigorous cross-examination by the prosecutor. Defendant did not have significant subaverage intellectual functioning or significant or substantial deficits in adaptive behavior before turning 18 years old. Thus, he did not meet his burden of proving that he was mentally retarded and, thus, not eligible for the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also stated that &sect; 17-1-7(b) was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court found that the trial court should have permitted the state to present to the jury all the evidence it had to offer toward proving both the felony charges and the misdemeanor charges. The trial court made a pretrial determination as to the sufficiency of the evidence, and such a determination was not permitted by the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure or by Alabama caselaw.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the trial court did not err under Ala. R. Evid. 404(b) in allowing the State to introduce evidence that defendant had been convicted of capital murder in the killing of four other men because there were several similarities between the two offenses. The victims in both cases were young men involved with drugs, defendant telephoned the victims and lured them to a location of his choosing with the offer of making a drug deal and then shot the victims in the head after they arrived and took their property, the offenses occurred within a period a three days, and there was evidence that the same gun was used at both crime scenes. In light of the similarities between the two offenses, the two crimes were committed in the same novel and peculiar manner, and the evidence about the killing of the four men was thus admissible under the identity and plan or pattern exception to the general exclusionary rule. Further, because both offenses involved killings that facilitated robberies for drugs and/or money, the evidence about the prior killings was also admissible under the intent and motive exceptions to the general exclusionary rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of three counts of capital murder in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(18). The Jefferson Circuit Court, Alabama sentenced defendant to death. Defendant was also convicted of attempted murder, first-degree kidnapping, and first-degree robbery and was sentenced to serve consecutive terms of life in prison on those convictions. Defendant's motion for a new trial was denied by operation of law. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that Alabama's method of execution was unconstitutional. However, he did not raise this claim in the trial court. Rather, he raises it for the first time on appeal. Therefore, we review this argument for plain error pursuant to Ala. R. App. P. 45A. The appellate court found that the Alabama Supreme Court had concluded that Alabama's use of lethal injection as a method of execution did not violate the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Therefore, there was no error, plain or otherwise, in that regard. Defendant's second argument was that indicting him for, convicting him of, and sentencing him for three counts of capital murder violated double jeopardy principles. He based his contention on the fact that all three counts, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(1), Ala. Code&nbsp;&sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) and Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(18) were predicated on the same act. The appellate court found that each offense required proof of an element the other did not require.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of capital murder committed during the course of a first-degree robbery. Defendant was also convicted of first-degree arson under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-7-41 and first-degree theft of property under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-3(b). The Madison Circuit Court, Alabama sentenced defendant to death on the capital murder conviction, 15 years in prison on the arson conviction, and 10 years in prison on the theft conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's first argument was that the prosecution's opening statement in the penalty phase in which it stated to the jury that defendant had two prior robbery convictions but never proved such deprived defendant of his right to a fair sentencing hearing and his right to due process of law and protection from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The appellate court found that during its closing argument, the State referred to only two aggravating circumstances, and the trial court instructed the jury on only those two aggravating circumstances. Under those circumstances, any error in that regard was harmless and the jury would have returned the same recommendation even without the error in the prosecutor's opening argument. The trial court did not err when it excluded evidence about the bad circumstances of defendant's upbringing because much of the information that was included in the excluded documentation was not relevant and could have resulted in a confusion of the issues for the jury, and the information that was relevant was merely cumulative to testimony that had not been disputed by the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from Walker Circuit Court, Alabama, where she was sentenced to death upon convicted of capital murder, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(14), for intentionally murdering a witness in a criminal proceeding against defendant, where the murder stemmed from his role as a witness in a bigamy case against defendant. The Alabama Supreme Court reversed and remanded the court's prior decision reversing defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Raising a multitude of issues, defendant first argued that the trial court erred by failing to allow her to impeach the State's primary witness with evidence of his prior convictions for distributing harmful material to minors and further failing to allow her to admit evidence of these convictions during the penalty phase of her trial. Affirming the conviction and sentence, the court ruled that the accomplice's prior convictions did not constitute one of the statutorily enumerated mitigating circumstances in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-51. Moreover, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the prior convictions did not constitute a nonstatutory mitigating circumstance. The court also ruled that the evidence that defendant murdered the victim because he was going to testify in the bigamy proceedings against her both supported the jury's verdict and proved the aggravating circumstance. In defendant's capital murder case, where the jury clearly indicated that they were having difficulty understanding the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in deciding to send the written instructions back with the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of capital murder and the Mobile Circuit Court, Alabama sentenced him to death. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court reversed the death sentence and remanded to the appellate court which reversed the sentence and remanded to the trial court. On remand, the trial court sentenced defendant to death. The appellate court affirmed. Defendant filed a Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition and challenged his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-9.1 motion involved reopening an existing case, in which there had been a conviction and sentence, for possible resentencing. Logically, then, any order either granting or denying a request for reconsideration of a sentence would be appealable. The circuit court's ruling in the instant case would, in effect, extend the proceedings on defendant's direct appeal from his conviction and sentence. Therefore, the appellate court concluded that the circuit court's order constituted a final judgment or ruling that supported an appeal to the appellate court. By its plain language, Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.1(f) applied only in situations where the notice of appeal from a conviction and sentence or from a dismissal or denial of a Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition was untimely. It did not mention and did not have any application to petitions for writs of certiorari in the Alabama Supreme Court. Therefore, the circuit court erred in granting defendant permission to file an out-of-time application for a rehearing with the appellate court and a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Alabama Supreme Court if the appellate court denied his application for a rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court's order was reversed and the case was remanded for proceedings that were consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court held that defendant did not have standing to raise the argument that Ordinance 1478 interfered with the property rights associated with the bar in which she worked as she had no property interest in the bar. Ordinance 1478 did not conflict with the Alabama Clean Indoor Air Act, Ala. Code &sect; 22-15A-1 et seq. Ordinance 1478 did not include provisions that could not coexist with the Act or that would require the abrogation or abandonment of the Act. Both the ordinance and the Act were established for the same purpose and followed the same basic guidelines for enforcement and implementation; the penalty for violations of each were also similar. Ordinance 1478 merely added forums to the prohibition of smoking, which did not conflict with the subject or purpose of the state law. Under Ala. Code &sect; 22-15A-10, municipalities were not restricted from adopting and enforcing local laws, ordinances, or regulations that complied with at least the minimum applicable standards set forth in the Act. Ordinance 1478 did not run afoul of Ala. Const. &sect; 89 because it did not authorize the passing of any laws inconsistent with the laws of Alabama.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed a pretrial order by the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) that dismissed the indictment charging defendant with obstructing justice by using a false identity, a violation of Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a passenger in an automobile that was pulled over by the police.

The appellate court found that the trial court was clearly aware of the grounds of the State's objections to the dismissal of the indictment because the grounds were those stated by the trial court. Since there were no proper grounds to justify the dismissal of the indictment, the State's general objection to the dismissal was sufficient to preserve the matter. In addition, the indictment tracked the language of &sect; 13A-8-194, and was sufficient to place defendant on notice of the nature and cause of the charge against her.

After a third trial, he was convicted of capital murder in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) for killing the first store clerk during a robbery.

It then denied his Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 postconviction petition. The appellate court found that Carroll and Tomlin, which would have allowed the appellate court to give great weight to the jury's life sentence recommendation, did not apply retroactively to cases at the postconviction stage.

VIII. The appellate court disagreed. In Alabama, a person was deemed retarded if, before age 18, he manifested mental deficits and had an IQ of 70 or below. When he was 17, his IQ was 75; a pre-trial test placed his IQ at 72. The record established that he understood his Miranda rights and knowingly waived them. His statement that he did not &quot;want to answer no more questions right now&quot; did not clearly communicate a desire to cease all questioning. As police narrowly tailored their subsequent questions to clarify his ambiguous statement, his right to remain silent under U.S. Const. amend. V was not violated. He did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of Alabama's judicial-override provision, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-47(d), as the trial court followed the jury's recommendation. The sentence was not a product of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors. Pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-53(b)(2) and (3), the appellate court found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigators, and that the death sentence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant murdered three people during one act or course of conduct because, as he testified in the guilt phase, he was under stress for money he owed his drug supplier, and one victim had called his girlfriend a &quot;whore&quot; and a &quot;slut.&quot; As required by Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-53, the appeals court found the death sentence was proper and not disproportionate to the sentences imposed for other multiple homicides. The circuit court's conclusion that defendant was not mentally retarded was supported by the record. A forensic psychologist testified that defendant had an extensive work history that included working as a temporary construction worker. He said that defendant managed his money, had a bank account into which he tried to put money every pay day, had a common-law wife, drove a stick-shift car, and had put a diamond cluster ring on layaway and had been making payments. The psychologists's testimony consisted of testimony related to defendant's present mental functioning. A review of the voir dire examination of the prospective jurors showed no indication that the prosecutor exercised disparate treatment or that he focused on questioning black prospective jurors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to unlawfully breaking and entering a vehicle and second-degree property theft. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) adjudicated him guilty of the first crime, but reserved adjudication of guilt on the theft charge so the State could present witnesses as to the factual basis for the plea. As the State did not present witnesses at sentencing as to the theft charge, the trial court dismissed that charge. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In his plea colloquy, defendant admitted breaking a car window and taking $ 160 in cash from the car, but said that he did not take the CDs and the CD player police later found in his car. He claimed not to know how the CDs and CD player got into his car. The trial court reserved adjudication on the second degree theft of property charge, finding some question as to whether there was a factual basis for second or third degree theft of property. When the State failed to present testimony to establish a factual basis for second degree theft, the trial court dismissed that charge. The appellate court held that as the case involved a guilty plea rather than a trial, the trial court should not have dismissed the indictment based on lack of evidence to support the plea. By doing so, it encroached on the prosecutor's power to prosecute crimes conferred by Ala. Code &sect; 12-17-184, in violation of the separation of powers doctrine, Ala. Const. art. III, &sect; 43. It should have allowed the State to determine, in its discretion, whether to amend the charge to third-degree theft of property or to allow defendant to withdraw his plea and proceed to trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for proceedings that were consistent with the appellate court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also fined defendant as a subsequent offender pursuant to the Alabama Drug Demand Reduction Assessment Act and ordered him to pay an assessment to the Alabama Forensic Sciences Trust Fund. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that defendant was aware of the time and place for defendant's rescheduled trial and that defendant by his absence from the commencement of his trial had voluntarily waived under Ala.

On appeal, the court found that, although the trial court's order referenced facts that would support a finding that defendant voluntarily absented himself from jury selection and the trial of the case, the record did not contain evidence in support of those facts. Therefore, there was no affirmative evidence in the record indicating that defendant had notice of the time and place of the trial after it was rescheduled. Accordingly, the circuit court on remand was to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether defendant waived his right to be present at jury selection and at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a direct appeal affirmed a conviction for murder during the course of a robbery and the death sentence imposed, appellant inmate on death row appealed the decision of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) that denied his Ala. R. Crim. P. 20 (now Ala. R. Crim. P. 32) petition for postconviction relief attacking his conviction and sentence on grounds of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although the trial court adopted the State's proposed order denying relief, the inmate's due process rights were not violated because the circuit court's findings were not clearly erroneous. His right to an impartial jury was not violated because the juror misconduct claim was procedurally barred and due to be dismissed for that reason alone. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise a Batson or Powell challenge because those cases represented new law and were decided after defendant's trial. The inmate's claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel had to be dismissed because he failed to meet his burden of proof under Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.3 and 32.6(b). His argument did not show deficient performance and prejudice, nor did he offer evidence to show how counsel could have argued claims more adequately such that the result would have been different. Under Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2(a)(3), (a)(4) and (a)(5) the substantive ineffective assistance claims were procedurally barred because they could have been raised at trial or on appeal but were not, and many of the claims were addressed by the court on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Bibb Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him of capital murder in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40 and second-degree assault. The murder was made capital because defendant committed it (1) through the use of a deadly weapon while the victim was in a vehicle, (2) through the use of a deadly weapon fired from a vehicle, and (3) during the course of a first-degree robbery or an attempt thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that he was entitled to a jury trial on the issue of his competence to stand trial. The appellate court held that because the trial court found that there were not any grounds to doubt that defendant was competent to stand trial, defendant was not entitled to a jury trial on that issue. Under Ala. R. Crim. P. 11.6(a), the trial court had the authority to make a preliminary determination regarding whether there were reasonable grounds to doubt that defendant was competent to stand trial. The trial court properly admitted the victim's in-court identification into evidence. Even if the victim's pretrial identification was gained by impermissibly suggestive means, her trial testimony was clearly based on her independent recollection of defendant and the events on the night of the murder and assault. The trial court properly allowed evidence of defendant's prior bad acts. The evidence and the crimes were part of one continuous transaction. The jury could have reasonably concluded that the killing and robbery were part of a continuous chain of events, that defendant was an accomplice to the robbery, and that the robbery was intentional and not a mere afterthought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) convicted defendant of capital murder and attempted murder of four police officers, violations of Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13A-5-40(a)(5), (10), 13A-6-2, and 13A-4-2. The circuit court overrode a jury's recommendations and imposed the death sentence for the capital murder convictions and life in prison for the attempted murder conviction. Pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-53(a), the death sentence was automatically appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An instruction on voluntary intoxication or the lesser included offense of reckless manslaughter was not required because there was insufficient evidence from which a jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was unable to form the requisite intent to commit capital murder due to the effects of intoxication as defined in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-1-9(b). Defendant's rights under the Sixth Amendment and Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, were protected because an attachment under Ala. Code &sect; 12-21-182(a) did not have to issue to secure the presence of a missing witness who had not been subpoenaed under Ala. R. Crim. P. 17.5. A self-defense instruction was not warranted. The limited mandates of Ring were satisfied because by returning a guilty verdict as to the capital offense of the murder, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(10), the jury unanimously found at least one statutory aggravating circumstance, making defendant eligible for the death penalty. The sentencing order had to be clarified because the trial court did not make specific findings as to the nonstatutory mitigating circumstances, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-52, or state why it overrode the jury's recommendation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the convictions and remanded the case to amend the sentencing order to clarify the findings regarding the nonstatutory mitigating circumstances and judicial override of the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment without parole. On remand, the trial court was directed to reweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and resentence defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) found that a felony indictment charging defendant, a convicted sex offender, with failure to notify the sheriff's department of a change in her residence at least 30 days prior to her move, violated the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws. Thus, the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's order specifically found that because the offense with which defendant was indicted was a class A misdemeanor at the time the offense was committed, the State could not properly indict her for the offense as a class C felony. But, it did not dismiss the indictment in whole or in part. Thus, contrary to the State's assertion that the court's order was fatal to the prosecution, the order did nothing to alter the elements that the State was required to prove in showing a violation of Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-23. Second, the issue which was made the basis of the State's appeal was not one that could properly be the subject of a pretrial appeal by the State, pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 15.7. Thus, because the appeal did not fall into one of the other categories offering the State a limited right of appeal, pursuant to either Ala. Code &sect; 12-12-70 or Ala. Code &sect; 12-22-91, it had to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Baldwin Circuit Court (Alabama) convicting him of two counts of capital murder and one count of attempted murder, Ala.

While inside the house, he stole money from a wallet and a purse and took keys to a vehicle. The evidence was sufficient for attempted murder, as he dragged the wife around the house by the neck and struck her repeatedly, causing her to fall to the ground and hit her head several times and causing her to fear for her life. The trial court's instruction on the &quot;especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel&quot; aggravator (Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-49(8)) and the trial court's finding that aggravating circumstance were not erroneous. Defendant repeatedly struck and then strangled the victim before inflicting the fatal blows, the initial blows and the strangulation would have caused appreciable suffering, and the victim suffered extreme psychological trauma because he knew death was imminent and that he was unable to protect his wife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1996, in a second trial in the Morgan Circuit Court, Alabama, appellant was convicted of the capital offense of robbery-murder under Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of capital murder because he committed the murder during the course of a robbery. In imposing the death penalty, the trial court found the following aggravating circumstances: (1) appellant committed the capital offense while he was accomplice in the commission of a robbery; and (2) the offense was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel when compared to other capital offenses, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-49(8). At the same time, (1) appellant did not have a significant history of prior criminal activity; (2) he was an accomplice to the robbery-murder and did not personally shoot and kill the victim; and (3) he was relatively young that the time of the offense, Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13A-5-51(1), (4), and (7). Further, he was from an abusive home, he was likely raped as a young boy, and his drug and alcohol problems drove him to a life of petty crimes. Moreover, the jury recommended that he be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. In rejecting the jury's recommendation, the trial court properly weighed the aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances and correctly sentenced appellant to death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to five counts of capital murder. The matter was presented to a jury, which found defendant guilty and recommended that defendant be sentenced to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his Batson motion after the State used eight of its 40 peremptory strikes to remove black veniremembers. The prosecutor stated that he struck the challenged veniremembers based on their ambiguous answers to questions regarding the imposition of the death penalty or their opposition to the death penalty. The appellate court found that the State's reasons for its strikes were not pretextual, noting that the prosecutor struck both black and white veniremembers who indicated that they were unsure whether or not they favored the death penalty. The appellate court also found no merit in defendant's argument that the trial judge's failure to instruct him on the right to withdraw his guilty plea within 30 days of its entry voided the plea and thereby diminished the evidence presented to the jury to such a degree as to render their verdict improper because the withdrawal of a guilty plea was solely a matter within the discretion of a trial court. Finally, the appellate court upheld the imposition of the death penalty, noting, inter alia, that it had previously been held not to amount to cruel and usual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the summary denial of his petition for postconviction filed pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 by the Chambers Circuit Court (Alabama). In his petition, defendant attacked his May 2004 conviction for sodomy in the first degree and his resulting sentence of 40 years' imprisonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in summarily denying his petition without affording him an evidentiary hearing. The court, addressing each of defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, determined that the trial court properly summarily denied defendant's petition under Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.7(d). The court determined that nine of defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were single, conclusory sentences unsupported by any factual basis whatsoever. As a result, summary denial of those allegations was proper. Defendant was also found to have failed to plead any facts indicating that counsel's decision not to cross-examination the eight-year-old victim was not sound trial strategy, therefore, he failed to plead sufficient facts with respect to that claim satisfying the pleading requirements of Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.3 and Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.6(b). Overall, the court found that defendant's allegations were insufficient and that despite the reasons stated by the trial court, it was affirming the summary denial of defendant's petition.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(1), and sentenced him to death. Based on defendant's claim on appeal regarding a Batson challenge, the court remanded the matter to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on that issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and others badly beat and killed a victim. Defendant was convicted of capital murder, based on it having been committed during a kidnapping in the first degree or an attempt thereof. The trial court accepted the jury's recommendation of the death sentence. On appeal after a remand for an evidentiary hearing on the Batson challenge, the court concluded that there was no such violation under the plain error standard of Ala. R. App. P. 45A. The prosecutor's reasons for striking the jurors were race-neutral. The prosecutor's remarks did not constitute victim-impact evidence and evidence of the victim's good character during the guilt phase of the trial was not error. There was no error with respect to admission of witnesses' testimony, and the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. There was no prosecutorial misconduct, the jury instructions in the guilt and penalty phases were not erroneous, and the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating ones under Ala. Code &sect;&sect;&nbsp;13A-5-45 and 13A-5-49. There was no unconstitutionality with respect to the death penalty, and the sentence was not disproportionate in the circumstances under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-53.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of two counts of murder made capital because it occurred during the first degree kidnapping of the two victims, and of two counts of murder made capital because the same victims were killed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct. The Jefferson Circuit Court, Bessemer Division (Alabama), sentenced him to death for each count. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant beat one victim with an iron bar; the victims were bound and forced into the trunk of a car. Defendant and his accomplice doused the car with gasoline and kerosene and ignited it; the victims, who had been doused with gasoline, died in the fire. Defendant sought a continuance on grounds his mitigation expert could not complete his evaluation in time for the trial. The appellate court held that as defendant failed to show he expected the expert to adduce any valid mitigating circumstance, denial of the continuance motion was not an abuse of discretion. Defendant's claims that Alabama's statutory scheme allowing for judicial override of a jury's recommendation of life imprisonment without parole violated Ring v. Arizona, and that its death penalty violated the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, had been previously rejected. After the jury recommended life imprisonment without parole, the trial court properly ordered a presentence investigation report and made findings concerning aggravators and mitigators. Under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-53(b)(3), his death sentence was not disproportionate or excessive when compared to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his convictions in the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) for four counts of capital murder in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(5), (10) for his involvement in the shootings of four police officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeals court found that the evidence was insufficient to sustain defendant's conviction as an accomplice pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-2-23. The State established that defendant and a co-defendant had engaged in a hostile, profanity-laced argument with officers on the morning of the subject shootings, and that defendant threatened an officer. In addition, testimony of three witnesses and others who testified about drug sales and gun possession established that drug sales and weapons were part of the res gestae or the continuous transaction of events in defendant's capital murder case, and was not improperly admitted. However, although the trial court thoroughly addressed and made specific fact findings regarding the statutory aggravating circumstances and statutory mitigating circumstances, it did not make specific findings regarding the existence or nonexistence of nonstatutory mitigating circumstances offered pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-52. Thus, although it was clear that the trial court considered the evidence defendant offered as nonstatutory mitigation, it was not clear whether the trial court found any of the evidence to constitute nonstatutory mitigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The convictions were affirmed. The case was remanded to the trial court for it to amend its sentencing order to clarify its findings regarding the nonstatutory mitigating circumstances. If it found it necessary, the trial court could reweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and resentence defendant. The trial court's amended sentencing order was to be submitted to the court within 42 days.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate sought discovery of the officers' personnel files, his own county jail records, and records of the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR) concerning his family members. The appellate court noted that a petitioner for post-conviction relief could not use the discovery process to &quot;fish&quot; through official files or to investigate possible claims. To obtain discovery, the inmate had to allege facts that, if proved, would entitle him to relief. He sought the officers' personnel files to find evidence to support his claim his counsel was ineffective for failing to properly impeach them. But as he failed to allege how he was prejudiced by counsel's failure to cross-examine and impeach the officers, he failed to satisfy his burden under Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.3 and 32.6(b) and failed to establish &quot;good cause&quot; for the disclosure of that information. Information in his jail records that he sought would have been, in part, cumulative to other evidence that had been presented. The information he sought from the DHR records was confidential and was available by questioning his family members. Accordingly, he failed to show good cause for the discovery of those records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court granted the State's petition and issued a writ of mandamus directing the trial court to set aside its ruling allowing the inmate the requested discovery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury convicted defendant of murdering the victim during the course of a robbery and a burglary in the victim's home. On appeal, the court found that defendant's conviction and sentence were proper because (1) there was no indication that defense counsel suffered from any conflict, much less an actual conflict of interest; (2) the trial court did not deny defendant a fair and impartial trial by committing errors during jury selection; (3) the trial court did not err in allowing a police detective to testify about a statement defendant made to the police, in admitting photographs of the victim made during the autopsy and at the crime scene, or in admitting DNA evidence; (4) defendant was not denied a fair trial because of comments the prosecutor made during the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial; (5) the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion for an acquittal; (6) there was not a material variance between the indictment and the proof at trial that affected defendant's substantial rights; (7) the trial court did not err in instructing the jury during the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial; and (8) the imposition of the death penalty was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was convicted of two counts of identity theft (Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-192(a)), the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) sentenced him to 10 years' imprisonment for each conviction, to run consecutively. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A sheriff's office employee learned that someone had opened credit card accounts in his name at four stores. The State presented evidence that defendant's handwriting was on the credit applications for accounts at one store, that a phone call adding another name to one of the accounts was placed from a cell phone found in defendant's apartment, and that defendant had picked up mail at a mailbox listed as the address of the account holder. The appellate court held that as defendant failed to bring an alleged Brady violation to the trial court's attention until after his conviction, he waived any objection. His other arguments either failed to comply with Ala. R. App. P. 28(a)(10) or were meritless. However, the appellate court took notice, sua sponte, of what it deemed to be a double-jeopardy violation, as such a transgression implicated the jurisdiction of the trial court. Since both of the charges stemmed from the same theft of the employee's identity, and the two charges were merely based on alternative methods of proving that single theft, defendant's convictions and sentences for two counts of identity theft for a single theft violated double-jeopardy principles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded with instructions to the trial court to enter a new order that adjudged defendant guilty of the single offense of identity theft and sentenced him for that single offense. The appellate court pretermited discussion of defendant's remaining issue pending the trial court's return to its remand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 32, an inmate, who had been convicted of capital-murder and sentenced to death, filed a petition for postconviction relief raising numerous claims, including ineffective assistance of counsel. The State moved for summary dismissal as to a majority of the claims. The Lee Circuit Court (Alabama) granted the motion. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Among other things, the appellate court held that the fact that the circuit court adopted the State's proposed order did not, without more, support the inmate's claim that reversal was due. The inmate made numerous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, for which the inmate was required to identify specific acts or omissions of counsel that were alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment. The appellate court found summary dismissal of these claims proper because the inmate failed to plead sufficient facts supporting both prongs of the Strickland test, and merely asserted bare conclusions of deficient performance and prejudice. The appellate court did find, however, that the inmate pled sufficient facts to support the claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to conduct adequate mitigation investigation and failing to present mitigation evidence that counsel should have discovered. The appellate court further found that it was not plausible that the circuit court had personal knowledge of the facts underlying such claims and thus, the inmate should have been afforded an opportunity to present evidence in support thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was remanded for the circuit court to either conduct an evidentiary hearing or accept evidence in the form of affidavits, written interrogatories, or depositions regarding the inmate's allegations that trial counsel failed to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation and failed to adequately present mitigation evidence at the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of four counts of capital murder, attempted murder, robbery, and burglary. The jury unanimously recommended sentencing appellant to death for his capital-murder convictions. The Talladega Circuit Court, Alabama, accepted the jury's recommendation and sentenced appellant to death. In addition, the trial court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment for his other convictions. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant raised eight issues on appeal. Most were rejected, but the appellate court identified error with respect to appellant's convictions of burglary and capital murder during a robbery. Appellant's burglary conviction was vacated as violating double jeopardy principles because the burglary underlying appellant's conviction of capital murder during a burglary under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(4) was the same burglary that formed the basis for the separate indictment charging burglary under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-7-5. Although defendant's robbery conviction under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-41 did not require reversal on double jeopardy grounds, his conviction for capital murder during a robbery under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) was reversed because the trial court's jury instructions constituted an amendment to defendant's capital-murder-during-a-robbery indictment. The jury instructions changed the robbery from the robbery of the victim's father to the robbery of the victim and thus charged a new or different offense that was not contemplated by the original indictment, running afoul of Ala. R. Crim. P. 13.5. As such, the jury-instruction amendment constituted plain error under Ala. R. App. P. 45A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed appellant's convictions and death sentence for three counts of capital murder. The court likewise affirmed appellant's convictions and sentences for attempted murder and robbery. However, the court reversed the convictions for one count of capital murder and for burglary, and remanded the case to the trial court to vacate those convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of two counts of murder during the course of a robbery and a burglary, offenses defined as capital by Ala.

Code &sect;&nbsp;13A-5-55, an automatic appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After reviewing defendant's conviction and sentence for plain error, the appellate court found nothing worthy of reversal. Among other things, the appellate court found no speedy-trial violation where a majority of the delays during the four years defendant awaited trial were due to motions filed by defendant and defendant failed to assert the right until 10 months before trial. The appellate court also held that defendant was not entitled to hybrid representation. A sua sponte change of venue was not required merely because there was publicity surrounding defendant's case. Contrary to defendant's contention, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-54 was not violated where at least one of his attorney's met the statutory experience requirements. The appellate court further found no error in the denial of defendant's various challenges for cause, as any of the chosen jurors who initially indicated a potential bias were rehabilitated during voir dire. As for the alleged hearsay violations, the appellate court concluded that a majority of instances cited did not constitute hearsay and in the others, the testimony was merely cumulative of other lawfully admitted testimony and thus, any error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to unlawful possession of pentazocine and/or meprobamate. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Defendant's Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition challenging his conviction was summarily denied by the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-70 was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the claim was time-barred as it was not raised at trial and on appeal. Defendant was sentenced under the Alabama Habitual Offender Act, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-9. Because the sentences applicable to drug offenses and repeat drug offenses were provided within the Alabama Controlled Substances Act, Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-1 et seq., defendant had to be sentenced under its provisions. Defendant should not have been sentenced as a habitual offender. If defendant did not have any prior convictions for violations of the Alabama Controlled Substances Act, he should have been sentenced pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-70, rather than pursuant to the recidivist provisions in Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-76. Under Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-70, the proper range of punishment was not less than 2 nor more than 15 years in prison. If this section applied, defendant's sentence of 20 years in prison was excessive. The indictment did not allege that defendant had any prior convictions pursuant to the Alabama Controlled Substances Act. so defendant's argument might be meritorious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was remanded with instructions that the trial court make written findings as to whether defendant was sentenced pursuant to the Alabama Habitual Felony Offender Act or pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-76, whether he had any prior convictions for violations of the Alabama Controlled Substances Act, and whether any such prior convictions were used to enhance his sentence. If defendant was improperly sentenced, he was to be resentenced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate challenged the judgment of the Talladega Circuit Court (Alabama), which summarily denied appellant's Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition for postconviction relief. Appellant was an inmate on death row after his conviction for murder, during the course of a kidnapping, an offense defined as capital by Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(1). Appellant's capital-murder conviction and death sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's conviction arose from the kidnapping of a man, taking him to a ballpark, taping him to a bench, and burning him to death for failing to pay appellant and co-defendants $ 200 for cocaine the victim had purchased a few days prior. Appellant asserted on appeal that the trial court erred by adopting the State's proposed order denying his petition verbatim. The court found no error, holding that even when the trial court adopts a proposed order by the State in toto, appellant still had the burden of showing that the findings of fact and conclusions of law were clearly erroneous before an appellate court will reverse the order on the sole basis that the order was drafted by the State. The court set forth numerous reasons how appellant failed to show clear error. Specifically, the trial court did not err by not appointing counsel to appellant before denying the petition because the record affirmatively showed that at all times during the postconviction proceedings appellant was represented by counsel. Further, none of the ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised by appellant were found to have any merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in a municipal court of violating Montgomery, Ala. Ordinance No. 1-9, for making harassing communications in violation of Ala. Code &sect;&nbsp;13A-11-8(b). Defendant appealed. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charge. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complainant assisted defendant with a purchase he was making for his girlfriend. After the first encounter, defendant continued to send the complainant gifts and call the complainant at work, despite the complainant's repeated requests that defendant stop. Although defendant could challenge the constitutionality of Ala. Code &sect;&nbsp;13A-11-8(b)(1) based on a contention that it was overbroad, the appellate court held that defendant lacked standing to challenge the statute as being vague because defendant's acts, if true, clearly indicated that, if true, defendant's apparent intent was to harass, not alarm, the complainant. In upholding the constitutionality of &sect;&nbsp;13A-11-8(b)(1), the appellate court noted that the word &quot;alarm&quot; as used in the statute did not make it criminal to forecast a storm, predict political trends, or warn against epidemics of illness, as contended by defendant. When considering the word in the context of the entire section of the statute, it was obvious that the legislature intended the word &quot;alarm&quot; to only apply to situations when the speaker's words or actions caused fear of imminent danger, and that danger in some way found its impetus with the speaker.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because defendant's trial counsel was suspended from the practice of law, the court allowed her newly retained counsel the rare opportunity to file a brief on rehearing that raised new issues. As such, the court applied a plain error standard of review. Defendant raised numerous new issues, including that the State violated Batson by using peremptory strikes in a discriminatory manner and by discriminating against jurors based on gender. The court found that both white and black jurors were removed by peremptory strikes and that the State struck nine males and nine females. As such, there was no inference of purposeful discrimination drawn constituting plain error. The court found no error with regard to the admission of evidence or the comments made by the prosecutor, as well as the trial court's consideration of nonstatutory aggravating circumstances that the victim was adopted and abused. The court found that the trial court's sentencing order reflected that it found and considered one statutory aggravating circumstance, that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel when compared to other capital offenses, and that such consideration was within its province.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Houston Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted defendant of capital murder for the intentional murder of an elderly woman during the commission of a burglary in the first degree, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(4) (1975). Defendant was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction arose from his forced entry into the victim's apartment. He hog-tied the woman and gagged her so viciously, that her dentures were pushed to the back of her throat. Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred by failing to let the jury determine his competency to stand trial. The court found no error since defendant did not include a request for jury determination in his motion seeking a mental exam. The court further found no error with regard to the trial judge failing to recuse himself since the record showed that the trial judge was very patient and indulgent in dealing with defendant, who persistently spoke out offensively during the proceedings. The court also found no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in requiring defendant to be restrained in his chair during trial since it was clear that defendant was dangerous, violent, and restraints were necessary for the safety of the individuals present in the courtroom. The court further found that the death sentence was not excessive nor disproportionate, especially when the heinousness of the crime was considered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of the capital offense of burglary-murder for the killing of his former girlfriend, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(4), and sentenced to death. He filed an Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition, challenging his conviction and sentence, and he subsequently amended his petition. After the State responded, the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) conducted an evidentiary hearing and denied the petition. The instant appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Among other findings, appellant's ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim was precluded pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2(a)(2), (a)(4), because it was raised and addressed at trial and on direct appeal. Appellant's claim of incompetency to stand trial also failed, as although appellant alleged that he had several mental problems, he did not allege any specific facts in his petition to indicate that he did not have the ability to assist in his defense and that he was not able to consult with trial counsel to a reasonable degree of rational understanding of the facts of his case and the legal proceedings against him; therefore, he had not satisfied his burden of pleading and proof as to this claim pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.3 and 32.6(b). In addition, a clinical psychologist in a previous appeal had concluded that he was competent to stand trial. That appellate counsel did not argue that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury each day before it separated did not constitute ineffective assistance; as long as the court properly admonished the jury once pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 19.3(b), it was not error for the court not to so admonish the jury every day.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 32. The inmate had been convicted of capital murder during the course of a robbery, and he was sentenced to death pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was brutally stabbed and strangled. His vehicle was stopped after it was associated with two robberies. The inmate, who was in the backseat, was Mirandized and he confessed. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and he filed his PCR petition. He amended the petition and after an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied relief. On appeal, the court found that the inmate's claim as to ineffectiveness due to his counsel's lack of required experience under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-54 was procedurally barred, and a showing under Strickland was required. As the inmate's confession was deemed voluntary, there was no ineffectiveness as to the suppression issue, and a jury instruction thereon was deemed harmless error, which did not satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland. There was also no ineffectiveness in counsel's failure to object to other jury instructions, no inadequate investigation shown, and no failure to seek assistance of experts. Other claims were waived where there was insufficient support under Ala. R. App. P. 28. Counsel was effective during the penalty phase, there was no cumulative error, and many claims were procedurally barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant killed his parents during the course of a robbery or attempted robbery, which was deemed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct. He admitted to the actions, noting that he wanted to relieve them of the pain that he had continually caused them through his drug addictions and criminal history. Evidence included testimony regarding defendant's extensive psychological problems. The trial court accepted the jury's recommendation of the death sentence. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendant's statements were made to police voluntarily and after he was Mirandized and waived his rights. Denial of suppression of evidence seized from two residences and from his mother's vehicle was proper, as defendant lacked standing under U.S. Const. amend. IV to challenge searches of one residence and of the vehicle, and there was third party consent as to the other residence. There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions and the aggravated factors under Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13A-5-40 and 13A-5-49, and lack of a diminished capacity defense under Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) of unlawful manufacture of a controlled substance in the first degree, under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-218. She was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, and a $ 1,000 penalty was imposed, under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-281(a). She appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Material to make methamphetamine was found in defendant's truck. The appellate court held Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-218, barring &quot;clandestine laboratory operations,&quot; was not void for vagueness by not stating where the methamphetamine had to be made, as a definition of a &quot;clandestine laboratory operation&quot; was transporting materials, and, under Ala. Code &sect; 15-2-2, venue was where the crime occurred. Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-217(a)(2) said defendant had to possess precursor substances, but, under Ala. Code &sect; 1-1-2, the plural included the singular, so possessing one precursor substance was required. She did not have to operate or intend to operate a lab in the county where she was prosecuted, as a &quot;clandestine laboratory operation&quot; was transporting materials. Testimony about a business located within 200 feet of where an officer first saw defendant's truck showed a clandestine laboratory operation within 500 feet of a business. Her request for her criminal history did not seek Ala. R. Evid. 404(b) evidence, so her subsequent criminal act could be introduced without notice, especially as it was a subsequent act. A $ 1,000 penalty, under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-281(a), was erroneously imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was affirmed, but the matter was remanded for the trial court to set aside its imposition of a $ 1,000 fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Dale Circuit Court (Alabama), which acquitted him of one count of sodomy, but which convicted him as charged on two counts of sodomy and three counts of sexual abuse, and which sentenced him to 10 years' concurrent imprisonment for each sexual abuse convictions and to consecutive life imprisonment sentences for each sodomy conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court overruled defendant's objections to testimony regarding hearsay statements made by the children victims, but that ruling was conditioned on the three children testifying. When the children were determined to be incompetent to testify, however, defendant did not renew his objection, move to exclude the hearsay statements, or move for a mistrial. He did not raise the matter of their hearsay statements until his motion for a new trial, which was made after his convictions and which was denied. He raised the same arguments challenging the hearsay nature of the testimony on appeal, but the court found that he failed to preserve the issue for appellate review by failing to raise the objection again. Also, because the hearsay statements were admitted without a proper objection, they were legal evidence. Therefore, defendant's argument regarding the sufficiency of the evidence without those hearsay statements was moot. Finally, defendant failed to properly raise issues in his appellate brief to satisfy Ala. R. App. P. 28(a)(10) because he did not support them with authority or he did not raise the issues until his reply brief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of his conviction entered by the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) pursuant to a plea agreement for violating the Community Notification Act, Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-20 et seq., specifically, Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-26(c). Defendant reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motions to dismiss the indictment and to have &sect; 15-20-26(c) declared unconstitutional as well as the sufficiency of the factual basis for his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties' stipulation of facts indicated that defendant, an adult registered sex offender, allowed a friend and her two-year-old daughter to stay at his residence for four days. The friend stated that she had nowhere else to go and that defendant slept in his truck while she and her child slept inside the house. Defendant claimed that &sect; 15-20-26(c) was void for vagueness because it did not specifically define &quot;living accommodation.&quot; Upon review of other provisions of the Act, precedent, and dictionary definitions, the court held that the plain, ordinary meaning of that term applied and that &quot;living accommodation&quot; meant any overnight lodging, either temporary or permanent. Thus, &sect; 15-20-26(c) was not unconstitutionally vague. The indictment was properly amended under Ala. R. Crim. P. 13.5(a) to add an essential element, the phrase &quot;where a minor resides,&quot; because the indictment otherwise charged an offense and the record indicated that defendant was fully aware of the charge against him. Defendant's challenge to the factual basis of his guilty plea had no merit based on the facts stipulated to and the interpretation of &quot;living accommodation&quot; in &sect; 15-20-26(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Cullman Circuit Court (Alabama) of six counts of capital murder for murdering the victim and her children during the course of a robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeals court found, among other things, that the State's evidence was more than sufficient to convict defendant of capital murder. He confessed that he murdered the victims, he gave a detailed account of the injuries that he inflicted on each victim, and those details were corroborated by the wounds each victim sustained. When defendant was arrested he was in possession of a tool that was consistent with some of the injuries sustained by one of the victims. Counsel's performance was not ineffective, as counsel billed for approximately 210 hours related to the case, filed numerous and varied pretrial motions, and moved for a change of venue, which was granted. Counsel also filed a multitude of motions that were typically filed in capital cases, but had the Herculean task of representing a defendant who had confessed to murder. Defendant's sentence was appropriate under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-53(b)(3) as neither disproportionate nor excessive to the sentences imposed in other capital cases; he viciously stabbed and killed a mother and her two small children while they were in their home, then took money and other items from the home.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The capital-murder convictions and defendant's sentence of death were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Lee Circuit Court (Alabama) summarily dismissed defendant's petition for postconviction relief, filed pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 32, in which he challenged his February 2004 guilty-plea conviction for first-degree robbery and the resulting sentence of 21 years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed this order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that defendant's petition lacked merit and failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. Defendant alleged on appeal that this was error. His first challenge was that the reference to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-43 in the body of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-41 violated Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 45, which outlined the one-subject rule. However, this claim lacked merit, as both sections under chapter 13A fell within the exception for bills adopting a code. Second, defendant's claim that his indictment was void because it failed to allege the material element of intent also lacked merit, but claims regarding the involuntariness of his plea required remand as the trial court's order made no specific findings of fact regarding the merits of this claim. Given that defendant timely filed his petition under Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2(c), his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was not procedurally barred. Moreover, because this claim also involved his counsel's conduct as it related to the alleged errors during the plea proceeding, the court could not say that defendant failed to plead any facts which would entitle him to relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that trial counsel was ineffective for permitting the State to introduce evidence of his prior acts of abuse toward the victim, first claiming that evidence of his abusive relationship with the victim was inadmissible because it permitted jurors to infer his guilt based on his prior conduct toward her. The appeals court found that his prior acts of violence were admissible under the motive and intent exceptions to Ala. R. Evid. 404(b). The evidence against him was overwhelming, and the circuit court's failure sua sponte to instruct the jury on the use of the prior bad acts would not have prejudiced his substantial rights. Defendant failed to meet either prong of the Strickland test. There was no evidence indicating that the expert assistance he received at trial failed to meet the Ake standards, and the circuit court did not err in denying his request for funds to hire yet more experts for the postconviction proceedings. Defendant was not mentally retarded under the most liberal definition of mental retardation adopted by the Alabama Supreme Court in Perkins.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant went to a mall with the specific intent of finding a victim to rob. As the victim approached, defendant demanded his wallet. A struggle ensued, and the defendant struck the victim several times and shot him twice. The victim was dead when the police and paramedics arrived. Defendant later related all of the details of the crime to a friend, who had previously arranged for a body wire so that the police could hear defendant's confession. The appellate court held, inter alia, that even though a police officer was not a party to the conversation between defendant and the informant, because he monitored the conversation while it was occurring and testified that the audiotape was a reliable representation of the conversation, his testimony established a foundation for the admissibility of the audiotape under Ala. R. Evid. 901(a), (b)(5) without violating the Confrontation Clause. However, the trial court did not make specific written findings concerning the existence or nonexistence of each aggravating, mitigating, and nonstatutory mitigating circumstance enumerated in Ala.

He made a down payment on the tractor and arranged to pay the remainder of the purchase price when he picked the tractor up. Defendant paid with a check. He stopped payment on the check after returning home to North Carolina. When asked why, defendant told the seller he knew the tractor had a defect, he knew the seller would not give him his money back, and thus, he knew what he had to do. The court affirmed, holding that 1) jurisdiction in an Alabama trial court was proper because it could be inferred from the evidence that when defendant tendered the check for the balance due on the tractor, he had formed the intent to take the tractor and stop payment on the check; 2) the evidence supported a finding that the case involved a criminal theft of property rather than a prosecution for a civil debt; 3) the evidence supported a finding that the case involved a criminal theft rather than the collection of a civil debt; and 4) the evidence was sufficient for a jury to have inferred that defendant had a preexisting intent for the theft when he issued a check on which he could stop payment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) that denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus as an Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition for postconviction relief; defendant claimed, inter alia, that the indictment against him was void and his sentence was illegally imposed by the trial court rather than the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The incident giving rise to the rape charge was committed on June 18, 1979. Defendant claimed that because his crime occurred after May 16, 1978, his case was governed by Ala. Code tit. 13A and not former Ala. Code tit. 13. The appellate court reviewed the legislative history and determined that former Ala. Code tit. 13 was the law in effect at the time of the commission of the offense. Therefore, former Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13-1-130, 13-1-131 governed the prosecution and sentencing. Because neither Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 15-8-30 nor 15-8-31 required the time or place of the offense to be charged in the indictment, defendant's claim did not implicate the trial court's jurisdiction. Because Ala. Code &sect; 13-1-130 contained no provision for jury sentencing, the sentence was properly imposed by the trial court instead of the jury and, thus, was not illegal. Finally, because defendant's habeas corpus petition challenged the validity of his conviction and sentence, the circuit court's treatment of the petition as an Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for the capital murder of a woman during a burglary and sexual abuse. A jury recommended death, which was imposed and affirmed on direct appeal. Defendant's PCR petition was denied, On appeal, he challenged the standards of review used by the circuit court, the refusal to admit certain evidence at the PCR hearing, and the decision that his trial and appellate counsel were not ineffective. He raised other issues, but they were procedurally barred. The court found that the exclusion of evidence did not violate Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.9(a) because defendant sought to introduce affidavits for the first time in the PCR evidentiary hearing, he did not show that the witnesses were unavailable, and the affidavits contained hearsay evidence. As to the standard of review, a prior finding of no plain error on the direct review of death penalty cases provided by Ala. R. App. P. 45A precluded a finding of prejudice on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Finally, defendant did not show that counsel's decisions, including alleged failures to investigate and to present additional witnesses in mitigation, fell outside the presumption of reasonable trial strategy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeals court found that because defendant did not make the required showing of need, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his requests for expert assistance. The evidence supported the trial court's determination that defendant was not mentally retarded, as no testimony was presented to establish that any of his alleged deficits manifested themselves before he was 18, and he did not suffer from significant deficits in adaptive behavior. His allegation that the jury instruction on retardation was faulty was moot because a jury finding on retardation was not required. The trial court did not violate Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-44(a) by proceeding to trial with only one alternate juror, as the 12 jurors who were selected in defendant's case heard all of the evidence and deliberated as a group to decide his guilt and to recommend his sentence. No alternate jurors were needed or called into service. The death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-53, as the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel compared to other capital offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant confessed to stabbing his wife and son over 30 times each. At trial, the victim's father testified about defendant's prior assault on her and photographs of the victims were admitted into evidence. The appellate court held that defendant's statement was voluntary. Evidence of defendant's prior conviction was admissible under Ala. R. Evid. 404(b) to prove motive and intent. The photographs were admissible as relevant under Ala. R. Evid. 401, 402. The trial court correctly refused to charge the jury on the lesser-included offense of intentional murder as it pertained to the son because Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(15) did not recognize it as an offense. Defendant failed to establish the &quot;evidence of intoxication&quot; necessary to justify a lesser-included instruction on manslaughter under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-3-2(e)(1). No Ring violation was present because the trial court properly instructed the jury of its role under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-46. Although the jury was permitted to consider a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance, it was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was sentenced to death for beating to death her 28-month-old daughter.

The court found the grand jury proceedings were properly held secret, that presumed prejudice or pretrial publicity was not satisfied to warrant change of venue, that race-neutral reasons existed for removing each of the black jurors that were removed, and that legally sufficient circumstantial evidence of defendant's guilt supported presenting the issue of defendant's guilt to the jury. Finally, the court found that the child-murder provision under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(15) did not violate equal protection considerations regarding age and the Apprendi rule did not apply where the death penalty aggravator of killing a child under 14 was an element of the offense that the jury had already found.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted on two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-66. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of both charges. The Circuit Court of Madison County (Alabama) imposed 10-year concurrent sentences, and ordered defendant to pay a $ 2,500 fine for each count, $ 500 to the Crime Victims Compensation Fund for each count, court costs, and restitution. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the Child Sexual Abuse Victim Protection Act, Ala. Code &sect; 15-25-31 et seq., was unconstitutional because it violated his right to confrontation and that the trial court erred when it allowed the State to introduce hearsay statements from the victim. The appellate court noted that any limitation on defendant's right to cross-examine the victim was the result of defense counsel's decisions and not the result of any action by the trial court or the prosecutor. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred when it denied his motion in limine and permitted the forensic investigator and the forensic interviewer to testify as to the victim's out-of-court statements because the testimony contained more details of the assaults than the victim provided in her testimony. Among other things, the appellate court noted that the testimony was admissible pursuant to Ala. Code &sect;&sect;&nbsp;15-25-31, 15-25-32. Finally, the appellate court concluded that there was no error as to the trial court's grant of the State's objection to a defense exhibit, defendant's complete medical records, because the trial court previously ruled that only those pages previously disclosed were admissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Shelby Circuit Court (Alabama) of murder, and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed. The case was remanded for the circuit court to conduct an evidentiary hearing. The circuit court determined following the hearing that defendant was not mentally retarded, and that his trial attorneys did not render ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant raised additional issues concerning the remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant approached a man in a parked car. When defendant told the man that defendant was taking the car, the man, a law enforcement agent, pulled a gun. Defendant then shot and killed the man. Various psychologists testified as to the results of intelligence tests that were administered to defendant. Some of the psychologists testified that defendant tried to score low test scores in the tests, but functioned in the borderline range of intellectual ability. Additionally, defendant's appellate counsel testified as to counsel's shortcomings and personal problems in representing defendant. On appeal, the court found that, even under the broadest definition of mental retardation, defendant was not mentally retarded and that imposition of the death penalty in the case was not in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Additionally, defendant's ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims were precluded pursuant to the provisions of Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2(a). Finally, defendant did not satisfy his burden on his ineffectiveness of appellate counsel claim of showing that appellate counsel was deficient and that defendant was prejudiced by that performance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Madison Circuit Court (Alabama) of one count of capital murder. The murder was made capital because defendant committed it during the course of a robbery or an attempted robbery, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2). The jury recommended that he be sentenced to death. The trial court sentenced him to death. He filed two motions for a new trial, which the trial court denied, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant first challenged the testimony of a police latent print examiner. The appeals court found that because the case did not involve DNA evidence, the Daubert standard did not apply. Also, because print identification involved subjective observations and comparisons based on the expert's training, skill, or experience, it did not constitute scientific evidence; therefore, Frye did not apply. Rather, print identification constituted specialized knowledge that could be helpful to the jury in understanding or determining the facts. Therefore, Ala. R. Evid. 702 governed the admissibility of the examiner's testimony. Moreover, even if Daubert applied, the testimony was admissible. Defendant also alleged that the State improperly withheld witness statements based solely on speculative testimony by the victim's family members. However, he had not presented anything other than pure speculation to support his allegations. Defendant did not wear handcuffs and shackles throughout the trial but wore them going to and from the courtroom, and any jurors who saw him wearing handcuffs and shackles did so while he was going to and from the courtroom. He was not prejudiced by his appearance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Houston Circuit Court (Alabama), which, on resentencing following remand, again imposed a sentence of death on defendant after he was convicted of murder during a kidnapping in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, but his death sentence was reversed. The court remanded the case for a new sentencing hearing. The circuit court conducted such a hearing and again sentenced defendant to death. He appealed on a multitude of grounds. The court rejected defendant's challenge to the seating of the jury, finding that challenges for cause regarding prospective jurors were not improperly granted where jurors indicated they would recommend death only if the evidence met a higher standard of proof than required under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-46(e)(3). Moreover, there was no evidence that the State unconstitutionally used its peremptory challenges to remove African-Americans from the jury venire. Defendant had notice of the aggravating circumstance that would constitute the capital offense, and, since he had a second sentencing hearing, he had the added benefit of knowing precisely which aggravating circumstances the State would rely on. The aggravating factors were not required to be set out in the indictment or decided by special verdict forms and were sufficient to impose death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Talladega Circuit Court (Alabama), after a jury trial, convicted defendant of four counts of capital murder for murdering a victim during the course of each of four Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-49(4) aggravators of (1) a robbery, (2) a burglary, (3) a sodomy of the murder victim's wife, and (4) a rape of the murder victim's wife and, after the jury's 10 to 2 death sentence recommendation, sentenced him to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant visited the victims' home when the victims were preparing for a yard sale the day of the murders. That evening a neighbor called the victim's wife to tell her she saw a man looking through their window. Defendant was proven to have entered the victims' home, made the victim put his head between his wife's legs, shot the victim in the back of his head in front of his wife and child, and raped and sodomized the wife. The evidence convicting defendant included tapes of a &quot;911&quot; call, neighbors' testimony, the wife's testimony, teeth mark evidence (that could be physically inspected such that it was not subject to the stringent standards applied to scientific tests), and blood evidence from clothing defendant had abandoned to his mother. Ring was satisfied as the jury found the four aggravators to exist beyond a reasonable doubt. The mother's request that defendant live did not have to be considered to be a mitigator; there were no statutory or other mitigators. Defendant's intelligence quotient (IQ) tested 58 to 66, but the psychologist testified she thought he was malingering and probably had an IQ over 70; he was death sentence eligible under Ex Parte Perkins.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeals court affirmed the convictions and the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In response to the district attorney's petition for relief, the juvenile probationer argued that the State had a remedy at law in that it could appeal the ruling rendered by the circuit judge. However, the instant court disagreed as the State had only a limited right to appeal and that right did not apply herein. Hence, mandamus was the State's only remedy. Moreover, the State's filing of its motion for a sexual-offender risk assessment before the expiration of the probation period operated to toll said term. Based on the mandatory wording of Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-28, and on the clearly stated legislative intent, the judge had no authority to release the probationer from probation until he underwent a sexual-offender risk assessment. Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-28(a) also specifically provided that the treatment provider was to provide a risk assessment of the juvenile probationer 60 days before his projected release date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed an order ofthe Chambers Circuit Court (Alabama), which granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence of cocaine that police obtained after a traffic stop of an automobile defendant was driving.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant moved to suppress cocaine that was found on him after a traffic stop. An officer testified that he pulled over the car defendant was driving because the occupants were not wearing seat belts. The officer claimed he smelled alcohol, asked defendant to get out of the car, and noticed defendant was having problems talking due to something in his mouth. The cocaine was discovered in defendant's mouth. Defendant argued that the initial stop of his vehicle was illegal and that, if the stop was legal, the cocaine was found pursuant to an unconstitutional warrantless search. Suppression was granted and the State appealed. It argued that the stop was lawful due to the seat belt violations and that the request for defendant to open his mouth was not improper. The court held that, on the record before it, it could not determine the basis for the trial court's suppression of the cocaine. Therefore, it could not properly review the decision. The trial court made no factual findings. It could have decided the case on the officer's credibility regarding the initial stop. Also, there appeared to be an issue on whether defendant consented to open his mouth or was ordered to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the matter for clarification on the basis for suppression of the cocaine and for specific written findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding its determination of the validity of the initial stop of defendant's vehicle and the legality of the discovery and seizure of the cocaine in defendant's mouth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him for capital murder, committed during the rape of a 10-year-old, and which convicted him for first-degree rape and attempted murder of another girl. He was sentenced to death for the capital murder and life imprisonment for the remaining convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant on all charges related to attacks on two girls. It recommended death, which the trial court imposed. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in: (1) ordering counsel to call witnesses that defendant wanted, but who counsel believed were harmful; (2) not granting a continuance; (3) not severing capital murder charges from other charges; (4) not allowing counsel to withdraw; and (5) making the sentencing order. Defendant's insistence on calling the witnesses over counsel's objections invited any error, a continuance was not likely to produce a missing witness, severance was not mandatory given similarities in the crimes, and no conflict of interest was shown to justify withdrawal. The State conceded error in the sentencing order. Only facts related to the crime, and not defendant's lack of remorse after, could be considered for the heinous crime aggravator. The Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-47(d) directive for specific findings was not met where an aggravator that was not listed in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-49 was applied, findings on each statutory mitigator in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-51 were missing, and factors beyond Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-47(e) were considered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the cause so that the trial court could amend its sentencing order. The trial court was directed to make findings as to and consider only those aggravating factors set out by statute and was to address each of statutory mitigating factors. The court pretermitted its complete plain error review of the case and its review of the sentence pending the trial court's return to remand.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-5-40. The jury recommended that defendant be sentenced to death. The trial court accepted the jury's recommendation and sentenced defendant to death for his capital-murder convictions. The trial court summarily denied defendant's motion for a new trial without affording him an evidentiary hearing. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant worked as a handyman for the victims, a married couple. Defendant drove the husband to meet with a man for a sale of the victims' property. The husband received money, including $ 100 bills, from the buyer. Defendant drove the husband to his home and then borrowed the victims' car. The victims' bodies were later found in their home. The money the husband received was missing. The police found the victim's car and defendant at a motel. The police found money, including $ 100 bills, with defendant. DNA evidence linked defendant to the murders. On appeal, the court found that (1) because there was both probable cause and exigent circumstances, defendant's arrest was lawful, and the evidence obtained after the arrest and his statement were admissible; (2) defendant voluntarily consented to the search of the motel room and the car; (3) the seizure and subsequent testing of defendant's clothing was a proper incident to his arrest; (4) the affidavit submitted in support of the seizure order was not defective; and (5) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the State of Alabama's challenge for cause as to a prospective juror due to her death penalty concerns.</SPAN></P>

Third, after making a credibility choice against defendant on his motion to suppress, the trial court properly resolved a conflict against defendant. Fourth, statements from co-conspirators were not hearsay. And finally, defendant did not prove his entitlement to a mistrial, the State did not commit a Brady violation, gruesome photographs of the victim's badly burned body were properly admitted, the instructions given by the trial court were proper, defendant's double jeopardy rights were not violated, his other constitutional attacks were unsupported, and the propriety of the conviction and sentence, pursuant to Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A judge in the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) denied petitioner detainee's request for a writ of habeas corpus, in which he alleged that Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-196 was unconstitutional. The judge also denied the detainee's motion to reduce bail. The detainee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The detainee challenged the judgments entered against him, first contending that Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-196, which provided that venue for the offense of identity theft was proper in a county other than where the offense occurred, was unconstitutional because it conflicted with Ala. Const. art.  I, &sect; 6. The appeals court disagreed. The Alabama Legislature specifically designated that venue was proper either in the county where the crime took place or where the victim resided. Identity theft, by its definition under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-192, was a continuing offense that in most instances occurred in more than one county or even more than one state. Further, no provision within Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 limited venue in a criminal case to one county or even one state. Second, as the detainee admitted in his petition that he waived extradition, the legality of said extradition was no longer a proper subject of any legal attack. Finally, given the unique circumstances of the instant case, specifically, the fact that defendant had no ties to Alabama, the $ 100,000 bail set against him was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded for specific findings of fact, and the trial court submitted findings that the offense was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel when compared to other capital offenses, and denied defendant's motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that defendant's acts were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel when compared to other capital offenses. Despite the mitigating circumstances that defendant had no significant history of prior criminal activity, committed the offense while he was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional distress, and that his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired, the death sentence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate challenged the order of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which denied her Ala. R. Crim. P. R. 32 petition. The inmate had been convicted of murder made capital because it was committed for a pecuniary or other valuable consideration or pursuant to a contract or for hire, an offense made capital by Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(7) (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate first claimed on appeal that the circuit court erred in denying relief on her claim that the prosecution exercised peremptory strikes against black venire-members in violation of Batson. The court upheld the circuit court's ruling concluding that the inmate's presentation of only statistic information, and no facts, failed to support her claim that the principles of Batson had been violated that she failed to establish a prima facie showing of purposeful or intentional discrimination by the State in its exercise of peremptory strikes. The court concluded that most of the inmate's claims of ineffectiveness of counsel amounted to nothing more than a bare allegation, unsupported by any factual basis but that she did prove that her counsel was ineffective for failing to have presented mitigating evidence at sentencing. The court determined that had counsel conducted a reasonable investigation into possible mitigating evidence, the balance between the aggravating circumstance and the mitigating circumstances would have tipped further in favor of a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the circuit court's order as to sentencing and remanded the case to the circuit court for a new penalty-phase hearing before a jury and then an additional hearing before the trial judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of capital murder for killing an 87-year-old woman in her home during a first-degree burglary. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, finding that, because the jury convicted defendant of the capital offense of burglary-murder, the statutory aggravating circumstance was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Furthermore, the court found that, because the jury found the existence of one aggravating circumstance, defendant was exposed to or eligible for the death penalty. The court found also that the newspaper stories on the murder were factual and relatively objective and not accusatory, inflammatory, or sensational; therefore, they did not contain prejudicial information. Furthermore, the court found that defendant did not prove that the media attention inflamed or saturated the community so that there was an emotional tide against him; thus his case did not warrant a presumption of prejudice based on pretrial publicity. Lastly, the court found that the trial judge did not follow the sentencing procedures for death penalty cases outlined in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-47 and remanded for written findings of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction, but remanded the cause with instructions that the trial court enter specific written findings concerning the existence or nonexistence of each aggravating circumstance, each mitigating circumstance, and any additional mitigating circumstances offered, as mandated by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Baldwin Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him of killing his wife while she was in a motor vehicle, a murder defined as capital by Ala. Code &sect; 13A- 5-40(a)(17) (1975), and, upon the jury's recommendation, sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and his wife were separated. They had one child together and the wife had another child while defendant was serving a prison sentence in Florida. Defendant had learned that he was not the father of the second child and suspected that his wife was having an affair with his cousin. The wife went to defendant's father's house and asked defendant to come and talk with her. Defendant left the house with a butcher knife. While the two were in the car, the wife received a phone call from the cousin. Defendant became angry, pulled out the butcher knife, and stabbed his wife 32 times. Defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, finding that no heat-of-passion instruction was necessary because defendant did not catch his wife in the act of sexual intercourse. To the extent that Anderson v. State, 507 So. 2d 580 (Ala. Crim. App. 1987) held otherwise, the court overruled that case. The court then found that because the trial court erred in applying a non-statutory aggravating circumstance related to defendant's pattern of violence toward his wife, the cause had to be remanded for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction but reversed as to sentencing and remanded the cause to the trial court with instructions that it hold a new sentencing hearing before a duly empaneled jury and enter a new sentencing order after weighing the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of capital murder of a child less than 14 years of age, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(15), and sentenced to death, but the supreme court reversed. Once again, a jury found him guilty of capital murder as charged in the indictment, and recommended a death sentence. The Tuscaloosa Circuit Court (Alabama) accepted the jury's recommendation and sentenced defendant to death. From this conviction and sentence defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">There was no real dispute at trial that defendant's son was the victim of shaken impact syndrome--that he had been severely shaken and beaten. The only real issue was who had caused the son's injuries. The appeals court, among other rulings, found no error on the trial court's part in denying defendant's motion to suppress several statements made to police. There was no error, plain or otherwise, in the trial court's allowing a physician to testify in rebuttal, or in the denial of defendant's motions for a new trial. There was no error in the trial court's refusal to sua sponte declare a mistrial or remove a juror from the jury based on the prosecutor's comments. Defendant's contention that there was a cumulative prejudicial effect resulting from multiple improper arguments by the prosecutor was without merit. Finally, there was no evidence that the sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. The appeals court concurred in the trial court's judgment that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, and agreed that death was the appropriate sentence. The trial court's conclusions were supported.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Baldwin Circuit Court (Alabama) convicted defendant of three counts of capital murder and despite the jury's recommendation to sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of parole, the court sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the sentence imposed. The appeals court first held that his retardation was offered to establish a statutory mitigating circumstance. Second, while evidence raised an inference of mental retardation, contrary evidence also existed, and this conflict was better resolved by the trial court. The best course of action until the Legislature acted on the issue was under Ala. R. Crim. P. 32. Third, the trial court failed to state its reasons for giving the jury's recommendation of life in prison consideration, and that it considered that recommendation as a mitigating circumstance. It also found non-statutory mitigating circumstances existed, but failed to identify what they were. Thus, on remand, the trial court was to: (1) determine whether defendant was mentally retarded, (2) consider the jury's recommendation as a mitigating circumstance, (3) reweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and, if necessary, resentence defendant; (4) amend its sentencing order to reflect consideration of the jury's recommendation and the specific reasons it gave that recommendation consideration; and (5) identify the specific non-statutory mitigating circumstances found.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his conviction by the Tuscaloosa Circuit Court (Alabama), upon his guilty plea, for a violation of the Alabama Community Notification Act (CNA), Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the CNA's residency requirement constituted retroactive punishment proscribed by the Ex Post Facto Clause. The appellate court held that defendant did not support his claim that the residency requirement constituted a punitive measure, either as applied to him or on its face. In enacting the CNA, the Alabama legislature intended to create a civil scheme designed to protect the citizens of Alabama and their children. That the CNA was found in the Alabama Criminal Code was not dispositive of whether it was punitive. Defendant failed to show how the CNA rendered defendant or any other sex offender homeless. Defendant also failed to show that defendant or any other sex offender was affirmatively disabled or restrained by the CNA. The CNA had a rational, nonpunitive purpose of public safety and was not excessive with respect to that purpose. Defendant failed to show that the effects of the CNA negated the Alabama legislature's intention to protect the public, in particular children, from convicted sex offenders. Therefore, the CNA was nonpunitive, both on its face and in terms of its effects and did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.</SPAN></P>

The burden was on the next friend to clearly establish the propriety of his status and thereby justify the jurisdiction of the appellate court. The petition contained no explanation as to the next friend's relationship with the inmate, or as to why the inmate's attorney did not file the petition on his behalf. Nor was there a reference to the inmate's current age. Therefore, the petition, scant at best, totally failed to comply with the requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition pursuant to Ala.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time of defendant's arrest, officers seized $ 10,000 found at his home. This money was subject to a civil forfeiture proceeding. Under the plea agreement, defendant agreed to pay $ 5,000 to the State and the other $ 5,000 was to be paid to his counsel, if the charges were dismissed. The State argued that the trial court erred in finding an agreement and that if there was an agreement, it was never approved by the trial court. The court found that it could not review the State's objections for lack of approval because they were not raised below. The court upheld the trial court's finding that there was an agreement, but found that the agreement was unenforceable as against public policy. The State would not be allowed to forbear the prosecution of a suspected criminal in return for a payoff because of the public interest in prosecuting drug offenders. It was improper for the State to threaten a defendant in a civil forfeiture proceeding with criminal prosecution. Additionally, the agreement was unenforceable because the criminal court could not have ordered the civil court to accept the agreement between the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment dismissing the indictment and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of three counts of capital murder, seven counts of theft, and one count of receiving stolen property and recommended the imposition of the death penalty. The Baldwin Circuit Court (Alabama) conducted a separate hearing and considered additional evidence, then ordered that the death penalty be imposed for the capital-murder convictions. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was held in a hall closet for 24 hours and then shot in the back of the head. The appellate court held that defendant's double-jeopardy rights were violated because he was convicted of robbery-murder and also for the underlying thefts that constituted an element of the capital-murder charges. Thus, the theft convictions were in error. However, the remainder of defendant's convictions and sentences were upheld. The testimony about the victim's will that was elicited was properly admitted at trial because it was not hearsay. Further, the note the co-defendant wrote to his girlfriend was within the res gestae of the crime, and the trial court correctly admitted the note into evidence as a statement made in furtherance of a conspiracy. Next, defendant's motion to suppress evidence was properly denied because he did not have standing to object to the search of the vehicle and the seizure of the evidence from the vehicle as he did not own the vehicle. As to sentencing, the evidence established the aggravating circumstance that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel was fully supported by the record, as the victim suffered prolonged psychological torture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The cause was remanded with directions to vacate the theft convictions and sentences. The remaining convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-6-66(a)(3), and sentenced him, as an habitual felony offender, to 20 years in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeals court upheld defendant's conviction, despite his allegations that the testimony from the victim child was erroneously admitted. The child was available, subject to cross-examination, and her version of the facts was both corroborated and held to be sufficiently trustworthy. Further, the jury was free to afford the victim's out-of-court statements whatever weight that it deemed appropriate. Second, the filing of a notice of appeal did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to address defendant's timely filed post-trial motions. Third, defendant was not entitled to an acquittal, as his act of placing his finger inside of the victim's vagina, and placing her hand on his penis, constituted sufficient sexual contact to support a conviction. Fourth, because he did not object to the State's failure to provide him with a copy of the Ohio conviction prior to sentencing, he waived the issue. However, because said conviction was for a crime which if committed in Alabama would not have been a felony, the State failed to meet its burden to invoke the Habitual Felony Offender Act, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court erred in enhancing defendant's sentence based upon an Ohio conviction. Thus, the matter was remanded for resentencing. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. He filed an Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition, challenging his convictions, which the Tuscaloosa Circuit Court (Alabama) denied. The inmate appealed, raising several arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate argued the circuit court improperly denied his motions to amend his petition and the discovery agreements. The appeals court found the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motions to amend his petition, as the inmate caused the majority of the delays, and the court would not reward him for doing so. The circuit court did not err in dismissing several of the inmate's claims on the grounds that he did not sufficiently plead them, as they were precluded by Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.7(d). He also argued that his Rule 32 attorneys rendered ineffective assistance, but the claim was invalid as there was no requirement in Alabama that indigent petitioners be furnished counsel regarding post-conviction proceedings. He claimed that his trial and appellate attorneys were ineffective, but trial counsel considered, investigated, and presented evidence relating to his mental health, and the fact that counsel's efforts did not result in a sentence less than death did not make their performance deficient. As Ring claims were not applied retroactively to postconviction proceedings, his claim that Ring applied retroactively to his death sentence was meritless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment entered against her claiming error. However, the appeals court first held that her first claim was precluded because she could have raised it at trial and on appeal, but did not. Her second claim was precluded pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2(a)(4), because this claim was raised and addressed on direct appeal. As to claims 3 through 8, the appeals court agreed with the trial court that defendant failed to meet her burden of proving that her trial counsel's performance prejudiced her in any way. However, the failure of counsel to appear at the restitution hearing, as alleged in claim 3 constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Further, issues regarding the legality of the restitution order were not addressed because a new restitution hearing was ordered. Finally, because the legislative intent of the restitution statute was to compensate, and not to punish, the special damages that the victim was entitled to were limited to an amount which fully compensated the victim, and said damages were not to be punitive in nature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment denying the requested relief as to the non-jurisdictional claims was affirmed.

The State argued that the autopsy report and other associated evidence were admissible pursuant to the business-records exception to the rule excluding hearsay evidence. The appeals court held that admission of the report amounted to a constitutional violation, but that the error was harmless. The amount of evidence presented to support defendant's conviction, including his own testimony, was sufficient even without consideration of the autopsy report. Second, the demonstrative evidence presented by the State was not erroneously admitted, and the State did not fail to prove a proper chain of custody. Finally, because the jury found defendant guilty of manslaughter, the trial court did not err when it denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal as to the original murder charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, the owner of a construction company and two county commissioners, challenged the decision of the Marshall Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted them under Alabama's Code of Ethics, Ala. Code &sect; 136-25-1 et seq., specifically, for using an official position or office for personal gain, Ala. Code &sect; 36-25-5(a), and for offering things of value for the purpose of influencing official action, Ala. Code &sect; 36-25-7(a) and (b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence tended to establish that the commissioners would hire the construction company to do work in their districts, the company would overcharge the county, and then the commissioners would receive a share of the overcharge. Affirming in part, the court first held that the evidence presented by the State to corroborate the testimony of an accomplice witness was sufficient under Ala. Code &sect; 12-21-222, and thus, defendants were not entitled to a judgment of acquittal. Moreover, it was within the State's discretion to charge the owner with an ethics violation because the Legislature did not intend to limit the application of the Ethics Code to public officials and employees and the owner was convicted under a complicity theory pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-2-23. And, finally, the court held that, although the State was not required to make an election when it charged one of the commissioners for violations of both Ala. Code &sect; 36-25-5(a) and Ala. Code &sect; 36-25-7(b), because the actions were alleged in the indictment to be part of one ongoing scheme or plan, it was error to convict him of both offenses because that was exactly the situation proscribed by Ala. Code &sect; 13A-1-8(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the owners' convictions and sentences and one of the commissioner's conviction and sentence, but it remanded for the trial court to vacate one of the other commissioner's two convictions.</SPAN></P>

Virginia did not preclude imposition of the death sentence; (6) the sentencing order was remanded for compliance with Ala.

R. Crim. P. 32.2; (2) trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to pursue a Batson claim because Batson had not been extended to white defendants at the time of trial, and appellate counsel could not be deemed ineffective because the alleged error occurred on appeal to the state supreme court, where the inmate had no right to counsel, and thus, no right to effective assistance of counsel; (3) the inmate was not prejudiced by counsel's performance during sentencing because the aggravating circumstances far outweighed any mitigating circumstances, and, thus, death was the appropriate punishment; and (4) the trial court correctly determined that a sociologist's testimony was not mitigating evidence under Ala.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the decision of the Conecuh Circuit Court, which convicted him of two counts of capital murder under Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murdering the victims in the course of robbing them to secure funds to purchase crack-cocaine. Defendant raised numerous contentions on appeal, many of which were examined under the plain error doctrine of Ala. R. App. P. 45A.

Code &sect; 13A-5-54 was followed when the trial court determined that defense counsel was qualified; (6) the trial court was required to make findings explaining its sentence of death where the jury recommended life without parole; and (7) defendant's substantial rights were not injuriously affected by cumulative error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the dismissal of his petition for postconviction relief by the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the State did not prove every element of the capital offense and that, therefore, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to render a judgment and impose a sentence in his case. The appellate court held the claims were nonjurisdictional and were precluded because he could have raised them at trial and on appeal, but did not. Defendant further argued that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by allowing him to enter a guilty plea. Defendant did not specify which element or elements the State did not prove. Thus, his claim consisted of bare allegations and failed to satisfy his burden of pleading pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.3 and 32.6(b). The plea agreement was not necessarily void simply because defendant waived his right to pursue a direct appeal and postconviction relief. Finally, defendant argued that he did not voluntarily waive his right to pursue a direct appeal and postconviction relief. Specifically, he contended that the trial court and trial counsel did not properly explain to him those rights and the effects of waiving those rights. Neither the State nor the trial court refuted that claim. Thus, the matter had to be remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate appealed the judgment of the Etowah Circuit Court (Alabama) denying the inmate's petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 where the inmate had been convicted of robbery-murder in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) (1975) and had been sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A certificate of judgment was issued as to the inmate's conviction on February 23, 2001. On September 6, 2002, the inmate filed an Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 post-conviction petition. The trial court found that the inmate had not timely filed his petition within the one-year limitations period under Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2(c). In making this finding, the trial court applied the version of Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2 that had been amended on August 1, 2002, which had shortened the limitations period from two years to one year. The appellate court found that the amended version of Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2 was properly applied. Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2(c) was meant to apply retroactively to cases in which the appellate court issued a certificate of judgment before August 1, 2002, and cases in which the time to file an appeal lapsed before August 1, 2002. The Alabama Supreme Court issued an order that the two-year statute of limitations under former Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2 was to remain in effect until July 31, 2002. The inmate, therefore, could have filed his petition as late as July 31, 2002, but he failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review from a judgment of the Cherokee Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him of two counts of capital murder and one count of attempted murder. Appellant was sentenced to death for the capital murders, and to life imprisonment as a habitual felony offender for the attempted murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was seen by multiple witnesses shooting the driver of a van, then getting in and driving away. He fired shots at a police car in pursuit and was caught in the woods. On appeal from his convictions, the court initially noted that issues which were not preserved were reviewable under the plain error standard. There was no showing of a discriminatory purpose in appellant's capital indictment, the 20-year limit in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(13) was constitutional, and appellant lacked standing as to other constitutional challenges. Pretrial publicity did not prevent appellant's fair and impartial trial, there was no error in denying his pretrial requests to remove his appointed counsel, and there were no fair-cross-section or Batson violations to the jury venire. Evidentiary rulings were not reversible, a one-man showup was not impermissibly suggestive, and admission of photographs and a cap were relevant. There was probable cause for his arrest, dog-tracking evidence was admissible, and the evidence was sufficient to avoid acquittal. The prosecutor's comments did not require reversal, there were no Brady violations, and the death sentence was proportionate and not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate appealed from the denial by the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) of his motions for postconviction relief and to alter, amend, or vacate the denial of his postconviction motion, following the affirmance of his convictions and death sentences for capital murder and burglary-murder, and the denial by the Alabama Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court and of his petitions for certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued that the postconviction motion was untimely under Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2(c). The intermediate court held that the Alabama Supreme Court had amended Rule 32.2(c) to shorten the time-period for filing postconviction motions. In a later order, the Alabama Supreme Court provided an interpretation of the effective date of the amended rule, and had allowed the defendants affected by the change a reasonable time after the amendment to file a postconviction motion before the bar took effect. Because the inmate's motion was filed after that deadline, and because the applicable statute of limitations was the one that was in effect at the time an action was filed, Rule 32.2(c), as amended, applied to his motion. Thus the motion was untimely. The intermediate court held that it did not have the authority to grant him relief based on the amendment's violation of his rights to due process, to equal protection, to petition for habeas corpus review, and to not be exposed to ex post facto laws. Only the Alabama Supreme Court had rule-making authority, and the appellate court was bound by the Alabama Supreme Court's adoption of rules.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 15-12-21(d)'s scheme for paying defense counsel did not make counsel ineffective. No evidence showed counsel's conflict of interest for representing defendant's father against his mother or that counsel's adversarial relationship with the mother was deficient performance or prejudiced defendant. Counsel's failure to futilely seek to treat defendant as a youthful offender was not ineffective assistance. When the prosecutor recalled a witness, there was no misconduct to object to, as it was not shown the prosecutor discussed the witness's prior testimony with her or asked her to change it. Mental-health evidence presented on defendant's behalf was not deficient. Counsel was not ineffective by not seeking an instruction on felony murder as a lesser included offense due to diminished capacity, as Alabama did not observe diminished capacity. Counsel did not have to seek a &quot;no significant criminal history&quot; mitigator instruction, as the trial court so charged the jury. Waiving argument at sentencing before the court was not ineffective, as Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-47 did not allow more mitigation then.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate appealed the judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) denying the inmate's Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition for post-conviction relief, where defendant pled guilty to unlawful distribution of a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate pled guilty to the crime. The trial court sentenced him to a term of 20 years in prison. It split his sentence and ordered him to serve a term of three years in prison followed by five years on probation. The trial court also enhanced the inmate's sentence by five years, because the sale occurred within three miles of a school in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-250, and an additional five years, because the sale occurred within three miles of a public housing project in violation Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-270. Pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 15-18-8, the trial court was permitted to split the sentence if it was 20 years or less. The appellate court considered the enhancements under Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13A-12-250, -270 to be part of the aggregate sentence for the offense. As a result, the inmate's sentence was 30 years, not 20 years. Because the inmate's aggregate sentence was 30 years in prison, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to split his sentence. Where the State did not allege in the indictment the facts upon which the schoolyard and public housing project enhancements were based, this did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to impose the enhancements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was remanded to the trial court with instructions that the trial court was to set aside the split portion of the inmate's sentence. If the inmate moved to withdraw his guilty plea, the trial court was required to grant the motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) of four counts of capital murder and one count of robbery in the first degree. The jury recommended that defendant be sentenced to death for his capital-murder convictions. The trial court accepted the jury's recommendation and sentenced defendant to death. The trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment for his robbery conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a 17-year-old, entered the victim's home through a window at night, wearing a stocking mask, and threatened the husband with a knife. Defendant raped the victim, the wife. The husband left to get defendant money from an ATM machine. When he returned with the money, the victim sent the husband to a grocery store to cash a check. The husband told the store clerks what was happening. The police were notified. When the husband returned home, the police arrived, and entered the house with the husband. They found the wife's body, she had died from stab wounds, and saw defendant flee the house. Twenty minutes later, defendant was found hiding nearby. He had the victim's blood stains on his clothing. The knife and the mask were found nearby. Defendant told a jail instructor that he was the one who had raped and murdered the victim. On appeal, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, defendant's statement was admissible for impeachment, the trial court properly ruled on the evidentiary issues and the jury selection, and the death sentence was proper. However, the robbery conviction was encompassed in one of the capital-murder convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The capital-murder convictions and death sentence were affirmed. However, the case was remanded for the circuit court to vacate defendant's conviction for robbery in the first degree and his sentence for that conviction because that offense was encompassed in one of his capital-murder convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient had been charged with arson in the first degree.

After the motion was denied, the patient and the Department filed notice of appeal. In dismissing the appeal, the court determined that appellate jurisdiction only existed as provided by law. An appeal in a criminal case could have only been taken from a judgment of conviction. Moreover, a commitment proceeding following an acquittal was not a postconviction proceeding under Ala. Code &sect; 12-3-9. Under Ala. R. Crim. P. 25.8, the Department, among other persons, was permitted to file a motion seeking release of a patient. Further procedures were outlined in the Alabama Criminal Psychopath Release Restriction Act, Ala. Code &sect; 15-15-60 et seq. However, neither Ala. R. Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which sentenced him to 15 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to using a false identity to obstruct justice, a violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-194.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When defendant, who had several outstanding arrest warrants, was caught by police officers, he gave a false name and birth date. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's challenges to &sect; 13A-8-194. The court held that &sect; 13A-8-194 was not unconstitutionally vague because it adequately put ordinary people on notice of the conduct that was prohibited, and further it did not criminalize innocent behavior. Nor was &sect; 13A-8-194&nbsp;unconstitutionally overbroad. The statute prohibited the use of identification documents or the identifying information of another person or of a fictitious person for the purpose of avoiding summons, arrest, or prosecution, or to impede a criminal investigation. Therefore, it did not involve constitutionally protected speech. Thus, the overbreadth doctrine did not apply. After a thorough examination of other jurisdictions' laws, the court held that there was no violation of Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 45's single subject rule because the offense of using a false identity to obstruct justice was specifically listed in the title of 2001 Ala. Acts 2001-312 and that act dealt with only one subject. Finally, it was clear that defendant's conduct violated the statute.</SPAN></P>

P. 32 petition attacking his convictions for felony murder, first-degree robbery, first-degree burglary, and first-degree kidnapping. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on each conviction, the sentences to be served concurrently. The Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama) previously affirmed his convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury found defendant guilty of robbery, burglary, kidnapping, and, without naming the included felony, felony murder. The trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment for the felony-murder conviction and to life imprisonment on each of the underlying convictions, to run concurrently with the other convictions. The appellate court found defendant's contention that he was subjected to double jeopardy had merit. The record was clear that at least one of the felonies had to be included in the felony-murder conviction and thus could not stand. Moreover, the fact that the felony-murder sentence was to run concurrently to the other sentences did not make the error harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a decision from the Chambers Circuit Court (Alabama), which found him guilty of leaving the scene of an accident involving injuries or death without providing the information or assistance, as required under Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant struck a motorcycle rider while he was crossing some railroad tracks. Defendant left the scene of the accident, and he hid the vehicle involved in the accident. After the car was discovered, defendant contended that he hit the motorcycle because he did not see its brake lights. When defendant did not appear for his trial, it was conducted in absentia. Later, defendant challenged the verdict and the sentence imposed. In affirming, the court determined that defendant impliedly waived his right to presence under Ala. R. Crim. P. 9.1(b). The evidence showed that defendant had notice of the time and place of the trial. He was also informed of his right to be present. The court declined to find that defendant was only able to waive his rights after the trial had commenced. The court also noted that defendant failed to appear at his sentencing hearing. However, the court did not consider the issue because defendant did not include it in his appellate brief. The trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury that defendant had a right to leave the scene. There was no evidence to show that defendant was threatened at the time of the accident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Covington Circuit Court (Alabama) made a ruling in defendant's trial on a charge of first-degree sodomy that the State could not admit out-of-court statements made by the five-year-old victim because the statements were not sufficiently corroborated. The State then filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the appellate court in an attempt to seek review of that ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with first-degree sodomy. His case was called to trial. The State knew that it was going to try to introduce certain out-of-court statements made by the alleged five-year-old victim, but the State did not seek a pre-trial ruling on the admissibility of those statements, although it could have done so. Instead, during the middle of the trial, the State tried to get the statements admitted. The trial court excluded the statements after finding that they were not sufficiently corroborated. The State then filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the appellate court that would direct the trial court to set aside the order barring the admission of the statements. The jury in the trial was recessed pending the outcome of the mandamus petition. The appellate court found that the State had an adequate remedy at law which it chose not to exercise, that of obtaining a pretrial ruling on the admissibility of the statements, and which it could have appealed if the pretrial ruling was unfavorable. It then found that mandamus was not a substitute for an appeal and that it was not to be permitted where, as in the present case, a sufficient remedy at law existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was hired by the State as a consultant to study sites under consideration by state agencies for building warehouses. He recommended that the State purchase certain property, and the State paid him $ 25,000 for his services. A company of which he was half owner acquired an option to buy the same property, but he did not disclose this to the State. The appellate court found the indictment was sufficient. For defendant to have been a &quot;public servant&quot; for purposes of &sect; 13A-10-62, the compensation paid to him did not have to constitute more than 50 percent of his income; therefore, that fact was not an element of the offense and did not have to be charged in the indictment. The indictment did not have to set forth facts establishing a &quot;known potential conflicting interest.&quot; As &sect; 13A-10-62 defined the offense of failing to disclose a conflict of interest with sufficient definitiveness to provided fair warning of what conduct was prohibited and who fell within the scope of the statute, it was not void for vagueness. A jury instruction regarding the definition of &quot;substantial discretionary function&quot; was proper. The evidence had been sufficient to convict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Baldwin Circuit Court (Alabama).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of capital murder following the robbery and stabbing death of a gas station owner. The court reviewed most of his claims for plain error and affirmed the judgment. The trial court had not improperly expanded the heinous, atrocious, or cruel criteria when it stated that its finding that the murder was especially heinous was based in part on the victim's mental and physical handicap and that defendant was aware of that when he killed him. The procedure by which defendant was sentenced to death fully complied with the Ring decision of the United States Supreme Court. The existence of the aggravating circumstance that the capital offense was committed during a robbery was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Because only one aggravating circumstance had to exist to impose a death sentence, the jury's guilt-phase verdict alone exposed defendant to a range of punishment that included the death penalty. The trial court's finding of the additional aggravating circumstance that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel was a factor that only had application in the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, which was not a factual determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama), after a jury trial, convicted defendant of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(7) (1975) murder made capital because it was committed for pecuniary gain. Defendant killed his wife to collect about $ 377,000 of life insurance proceeds from a number of policies. The trial court overrode the jury's eight to four recommendation for life in prison and sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury found defendant killed his wife by staging a car wreck, and while she was still alive, intentionally burned her to death. Defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of the State's evidence, but because the death penalty was imposed, the appeals court reviewed the evidence to find it was sufficient to support the capital murder conviction. Defendant had told another inmate he killed his wife. The wife's friend's hearsay testimony that the wife said she thought defendant might kill her was admissible to show the wife's state of mind to refute defendant's statement that they had a good relationship. The appeals court restated chain of custody rules and determined the weakness of a link in the custody of defendant's clothing, containing petroleum residue, raised a credibility, not admissibility issue. The appeals court discussed Frye, Brady, suppression of his abandoned highway patrolman footlocker evidence, continuances, police opinion (as opposed to expert) testimony on the crime scene, and judicial bias issues in its primarily plain error review. The jury's finding the pecuniary gain aggravator satisfied Ring and permitted the trial court to impose death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeals court stated (1) the trial court's imposition of sentence after giving weight to the jury's recommendation was approved and did not violate Ring since the jury found one aggravator, so finding a second did not increase the sentence, and (2) the death sentence was constitutional, proportionate, and not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Baldwin Circuit Court (Alabama) of capital murder, attempted murder, first degree attempted kidnapping, first degree attempted rape, and first degree robbery, and was sentenced to death and eight consecutive sentences of life imprisonment without parole. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found competent. The appellate court held admitting crime circumstances at the competency trial was proper, and any error was invited. Consolidating similar noncapital and capital offenses was proper. Ala. R. Crim. P. 11.2(b)(1), precluding competency test results in the guilt phase, was not violated by telling the guilt phase jury it would only hear the case if another jury found defendant competent. Matching evidence and population-frequency-statistical evidence as to nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and mitochondrial DNA were admissible, without the known or potential rate of error. The State proved a corpus delicti independent of defendant's confessions, which were admissible. Defendant was not entitled to an abuse of a corpse lesser-included offense instruction. All mitigating evidence was considered. Defendant was not mentally retarded. A jury found aggravators allowing a death sentence arising from the offenses, beyond a reasonable doubt, and factors not so found involved prior convictions or weighing aggravators and mitigators and did not have to be found by a jury. Defendant's attempted kidnapping sentences exceeded the maximum and were void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's capital murder, attempted murder, attempted rape, and robbery convictions and sentences were affirmed, as was his attempted kidnapping conviction, but his attempted kidnapping sentences were reversed, and the matter was remanded for resentencing on those convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of two counts of capital murder; the murder was made capital because the defendant committed it while under sentence of life imprisonment, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(6), and because he had been convicted of murder within the 20 years preceding the capital offense, &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(13). The Escambia Circuit Court (Alabama) sentenced defendant to death; his motion for a new trial was overruled by operation of law. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and another inmate fatally stabbed the victim after he slapped defendant. The trial court did not allow a prison psychology expert to testify as to defendant's state of mind and the process of institutionalization. The appellate court approved, as such testimony would have been speculation; and even if it had been relevant to the self-defense issue, it was excludable under Miss. R. Evid. 403 due to the danger of confusing the issues or misleading the jury. The State was properly allowed to prove defendant's prior convictions, as they were elements of the offense, and were not introduced to prove his bad character. His conviction and sentence for capital murder were not disproportionate because his allegedly more culpable co-defendant was not charged with capital murder, since the co-defendant was not eligible for such prosecution. Improper testimony about defendant's admission of killing the victim was not grounds for a mistrial, as the judge struck it and gave a curative instruction, and the evidence was cumulative to defendant's other statements that were properly admitted. As defendant was not mentally retarded, executing him was not cruel or unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. He filed an Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition, challenging his conviction and sentence of death on grounds that he was mentally retarded and his counsel had been ineffective in not raising this issue. The Pike Circuit Court (Alabama) denied relief, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate claimed that his trial attorneys were ineffective because they did not develop and present evidence that he was retarded. The appellate court held that in light of the Atkins decision, the inmate was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine if he was retarded and whether his counsel had been ineffective. The circuit court erred by refusing to allow a psychologist to testify as an expert on the grounds that she was not licensed to practice psychology in Alabama and that practicing psychology without a license was a misdemeanor; Ala. R. Evid. 702, not the licensing statutes, governed the qualifications of expert witnesses. The circuit court erred in using a bifurcated approach to determine whether to allow the inmate to present expert psychological testimony, as the inmate did not merely make bare allegations, but produced an IQ in the borderline range of intellectual functioning, and a letter in which one of his attorneys recommended that they request an independent psychological evaluation for purposes of sentencing. Finally, the circuit court erred in finding that the inmate was not retarded, as it lacked sufficient information to make this finding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was remanded to the circuit court with instructions that it conduct an evidentiary hearing and make specific findings of fact as to the inmate's claims that he was mentally retarded and that his trial attorneys rendered ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was brutally beaten and stabbed to death by several people including defendant. The appellate court held that the jury instructions on intent and on accomplice liability, when considered together, were proper, and they were thorough and specific enough to ensure that a guilty verdict would not be returned unless the jury found that defendant had the specific intent to kill. Sufficient evidence was admitted to find defendant had the specific intent to kill. Thus, no plain error occurred with regard to the jury instruction. Further, there was no plain error as to the trial court's instructions on the &quot;especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel&quot; aggravating circumstance in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-49(8) (1975), as it effectively narrowed the scope of the aggravating circumstance and informed the jury that it applied only to those capital offenses that were &quot;unnecessarily torturous&quot; to the victim. The evidence overwhelmingly established that aggravating circumstance. However, the trial court did not make specific findings regarding the existence or nonexistence of the remainder of the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances, as required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The portion of the judgment which ordered the death sentence was remanded for resentencing. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his convictions, arguing that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional. Specifically, he contended that the statute was overbroad, and that it was a content-based restriction on his First Amendment right to free expression. The appeals court disagreed. The statute distinguished among the forms of expression being proscribed; it was not all nudity, but rather only nudity for entertainment purposes, that the Alabama Legislature sought to ban.  Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-200.11 (1975) was not neutral as to content because it explicitly permitted certain types of nude expression while restricting other types of nude expression based entirely on whether the expression is for entertainment purposes. The appeals court thus held that the State met its burden of proving that the state legislature's predominant motive in passing the statute was a concern about increased crime and other secondary effects. Section 200.11 restricted no more expression than was essential to accomplish the government's substantial interest in protecting public order and morality by combating the negative secondary effects of nude entertainment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's convictions for two murders had been affirmed and the case had been remanded for the trial court (Alabama) to correct deficiencies in its sentencing order twice. The trial court had complied with the appellate court's instructions to amend the sentencing orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that he should be resentenced, as he was borderline mentally retarded. The appellate court held defendant was not mentally retarded under Ala. Code &sect; 15-24-2 or under any State's statute that prohibited the execution of a mentally retarded person. Defendant's IQ tested above the significant sub-average range. Defendant functioned in society. There was no evidence that defendant had a history of mental retardation. The jury found that defendant committed two murders during the course of a robbery. Robbery was an aggravating circumstance that supported a death sentence. The trial court was left to decide under Apprendi and Ring whether defendant was under a sentence of imprisonment, as he was on probation for a prior assault conviction. The evidence supported the trial court's finding that the murders were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel as compared to other capital murders. The indictment was not required to list the aggravating circumstances the State intended to prove. The sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. The aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances in each case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Limestone Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him of two counts of capital murder, robbery, theft, burglary, and rape, and sentenced him to various terms of imprisonment, and to death based on a finding of four aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant murdered his victim during the course of a rape and robbery. His appeal on multiple issues required remand on several issues. However, the court found the following to lack merit: (1) a 46-month delay, although presumptively prejudicial, was not erroneous based on other factors, including that delays were all attributable to defendant; (2) there was no racial discrimination found in the method of selecting grand jury-forepersons; (3) there was no prosecutorial vindictiveness in a second indictment which contained additional charges; (4) removal of prospective jurors was proper where some had medical issues and others had been properly challenged for cause; (5) defendant's arrest was proper and his confession was voluntary; (6) photographs and DNA evidence were properly admitted; (7) there was no reversible prosecutor misconduct; and (8) jury instructions were proper. Remand was required due to double jeopardy issues on the lesser-included offenses and deficiencies in the death sentence order. Aggravating circumstances that were remanded included a prior conviction based on a nolo contendere plea and the need for further details as to the heinous nature of the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the matter in order to vacate defendant's convictions and sentences for robbery, theft, and rape. Remand was further required in order to correct deficiencies in the sentencing order with respect to several of the aggravating circumstances, including the prohibition against consideration of a prior conviction and arrests, and for further fact-finding as to the heinousness or cruelty of the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Calhoun Circuit Court (Alabama) that convicted him of reckless manslaughter pursuant to Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Various witnesses either saw defendant, aged 20, drinking or smelled alcohol on his breath. The appellate court held, inter alia, that a number of defendant's allegations were not preserved for appeal. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's application for youthful offender status. It properly limited defendant's character evidence to his general reputation in the community, and terminated the evidence when it became cumulative. Although Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191(b) treated those under 21 years of age differently than those over 21 years of age, the statute was not unconstitutional, since it was rationally related to the government purpose of prohibiting underage drinking and driving. There was no evidence that the trial court was biased or hostile. Defendant's sentences were within the statutory range, and the trial court explained its reasons for imposing them pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 26.8.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed an application for rehearing in an attempt to have the appellate court consider the effect of a recent United States Supreme Court case after he was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for killing two people, and his conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of killing two people during one course of conduct and sentenced to death. The appellate court affirmed. While defendant's application for rehearing was pending, the United States Supreme Court released its Ring decision which applied its Apprendi holding to death-penalty cases and stated that any fact that increased a defendant's punishment to death had to be presented to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant argued in a supplemental brief that because the fact findings necessary to support imposition of the death penalty in his case were never made by a jury, he had to be resentenced. He also argued that federal law should condemn imposition of the death penalty by a judge rather than a jury. The appellate court rejected both arguments and denied his application for rehearing. It found that the jury's verdict that he killed two people during one course of conduct necessarily meant the jury found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that at least one aggravating circumstance existed that supported a death sentence. It also found that the United States Constitution permitted a trial judge, acting alone, to impose a capital sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of second-degree rape after he had consensual sexual intercourse with his girlfriend, who was 15 years old at the time. After defendant was released from confinement, his girlfriend and his girlfriend's mother moved into his house. When police learned that defendant was living with his girlfriend, they charged him with violating Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-26(b) (1975) by establishing a residence within 1,000 feet of property on which his victim or any member of the victim's immediate family lived. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges and attached statements from his girlfriend and his girlfriend's mother to his motion which showed that defendant and his girlfriend were engaged to be married and that his girlfriend's mother had consented to the marriage. The appellate court held that (1) defendant had standing to challenge the statute on the basis of the argument that it unconstitutionally impinged on his right to marry; and (2) the statute was overbroad because it contained no exemption from its punitive provisions and no procedure by which a convicted sex offender could petition a court for an exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate alleged that he was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment because there was no intercom system in the prison and the guards were unable to hear him yell for help if he was injured.

The inmate's notice appeal indicated that he wished to appeal the ruling to the court of civil appeals, however, the notice of appeal completed by the circuit clerk's office indicated that the appeal was to the court of criminal appeals. The appellate court held that the inmate's manipulation of the system by mislabeling the petition to avoid paying a filing fee did not raise a claim that was cognizable in a habeas corpus petition but instead asked for injunctive and monetary relief. Thus, the case was transferred to the court of civil appeals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) which denied his petition for postconviction relief, filed pursuant to Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court denied defendant relief because it determined the petition was time-barred under Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2(c), and procedurally barred under Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2(a)(3). On appeal, defendant argued the trial court erred in summarily denying his petition. The appellate court advised defendant had until April 1, 1989, to timely file a petition for postconviction relief based on his claim the Alabama Constitution of 1901 was unconstitutional because it had been adopted to disenfranchise African-Americans. Because defendant failed to do so, the appellate court concluded that claim was barred by the two-year limitations period set out in Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2(c). In addition, the appellate court noted that Alabama courts recognized the admissibility of DNA testing since 1991. The appellate court determined that had defendant filed his petition within a reasonable time, his claim that he had only recently learned about DNA testing would have been credible and would have been considered on the merits. However, because defendant waited more than 10 years to file his petition, the appellate court concluded the trial court correctly determined the claim was time-barred.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested for driving under the influence the evening of the murders. The victims' bodies were later found with six bullets in them. A gun with six empty cartridges, one victim's prescription bottles, and other items belonging to that victim were discovered in defendant's vehicle. Two witnesses testified that defendant took measures while in jail to dispose of his clothing. An investigator told defendant he needed to work things out with God and pray. Later, defendant confessed to killing the victims in video and audio recordings in the presence of his wife and the investigator. On appeal, the court found that (1) the video confession and statement were properly admitted; (2) the investigator was not a counselor; (3) defendant was allowed to cross-examine witnesses; (4) the items found in the car were admissible; (5) the trial court did not permit hearsay evidence to be admitted; (6) a videotape and photographs of the crime scene were admissible; (7) the trial court did not improperly instruct the jury; (8) there was no double jeopardy; and (9) the evidence was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a change of venue for pre-trial publicity, nor did it err in trying defendant as an adult. Defendant did not show the trial court's trial security measures were an abuse of discretion. Defendant's accomplice could use a mannequin to show how two victims were killed. The State's peremptory challenges were not purposeful racial or gender discrimination. Each juror affirmatively said he or she could set aside feelings in favor of the death penalty. The exclusion of jurors unalterably opposed to the death penalty was proper. The prosecutor did not impermissibly bolster a prosecution witness's credibility, and the jury was instructed not to consider any such comment. The trial court's failure to charge the jury on the need for accomplice corroboration was harmless. But the trial court did not specify why it found the &quot;especially heinous, atrocious or cruel&quot; aggravating circumstance applicable. The trial court had to find if defendant's background and family history was mitigating evidence, and state what weight it gave this evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who underwent his fourth trial, appealed from his conviction and sentence by the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama) for murder, an offense punishable by death because two or more people were intentionally killed pursuant to one act or a series of acts. Defendant moved that the trial court accept the previously entered jury recommendation of 12-0 for life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant did not allege the prosecutor intentionally invited reversal at previous trials, and the record did not support such an allegation. The prosecution did not place defendant twice in jeopardy on the charge of murder-for-hire, and the trial court properly allowed the trial to proceed under the indictment that charged him with double murder. The publicity surrounding the case was extensive. However, most of it occurred during earlier trials which supported denying a change of venue. There was no indication that the method used by the trial court to question prospective jurors prejudiced defendant. Defendant was not prejudiced by the accommodations made for the sequestered jurors. There was no reason to remove any of the challenged jurors for cause. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Batson motion. Defendant's testimony from his first trial was proper to prove his state of mind. Both the old and the new death penalty statutes clearly embodied the principle that the judge was the final sentencing authority and could override the jury's recommendation. The death sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Calhoun Circuit Court (Alabama) of capital murder. Following a sentencing hearing, the jury unanimously recommended that a death sentence be imposed. The trial court held a separate hearing, determined that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, and sentenced defendant to death. Defendant moved for a new trial. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to aggravated stalking of his ex-wife. The next day, defendant, in his car, chased his ex-wife and her friend while they were riding in the friend's car. Defendant caused the friend to crash her car by colliding with it. Defendant approached the crashed car and shot and wounded the friend. He shot his ex-wife five times. She died from her wounds. Defendant pleaded guilty at his trial. On appeal, the court found that the case had to be remanded for resentencing because the trial court failed to meet the requirements of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-47(d) (1975) by not entering specific findings as to each aggravating circumstance, each statutory mitigating circumstance, and each nonstatutory mitigating circumstance, and failed to discuss the weight it accorded the jury's sentencing recommendation. Further, the trial court did not err by admitting evidence of the aggravated stalking conviction, permitting testimony about the victim's character, refusing to recuse itself, admitting photographs of the victim into evidence, denying defendant's motion challenging the racial makeup of the jury, and finding defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was affirmed; however, the case was remanded for amendment of the sentencing order so that the appellate court could review the findings concerning the existence or nonexistence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances upon resubmission.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the trial court determined that it did not have the authority to grant probation because the district attorney had not recommended probation. The trial court denied defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the district attorney abused his discretion in refusing to recommend probation because defendant rendered substantial assistance to law enforcement pursuant to Ala.

The appellate court found that a plea agreement existed, but that there was a dispute as to the terms and conditions of that agreement. Because the appellate court could not determine the terms of the plea agreement, it could not determine whether the State arbitrarily or unjustifiably breached the terms of the plea agreement. Thus, the appellate court could not review the merits of defendant's claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court remanded the case to the trial court with directions for the trial court to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the terms of the plea agreement.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) (1975). A jury, by eight to four vote, recommended a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole. The Lee Circuit Court (Alabama) sentenced him to death by electrocution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and a woman were restaurant co-workers. Her nude body was found by a road with defendant's work nametag next to it. A participant in the crime led police to where he had disposed of defendant's bloody clothes from the crime, made a plea-agreement for a life sentence, and testified against defendant that he gave him $ 2,500 from the restaurant robbery/murder. Defendant admitted planning the robbery, but denied being present at either the robbery or murder. His aunt testified that he had admitted the murder to her. DNA evidence connected him to the murder sight. The appellate court found no prejudice to defendant from the grand jury foreperson whose role was purely ministerial. Alabama's statutory compensation scheme for court-appointed lawyers was not unconstitutional. A detective was properly excluded from the sequestration rule. Juror selection was proper and many alleged errors were harmless given that defendant exercised his peremptory strikes over veniremembers in question anyway. Defendant's motions for funds for mitigation and electrocution experts were properly denied. There was no evidence the robbery and murder were separate crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Etowah Circuit Court (Alabama) of distributing controlled substances, and the trial court enhanced his sentence under Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13A-12-250, -270, because the distribution occurred within three miles of a school and a housing project. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Any fact which enhanced defendant's sentence beyond the statutory range for the crime he was convicted of had to be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The enhancement of defendant's sentence for committing his crime within a prescribed distance from a school and a housing project was only proved to the trial judge by a preponderance of the evidence. As a result, defendant's sentence had to be vacated. The error was not so structural as to require the vacation of defendant's conviction. There was no requirement that facts causing the possible enhancement of defendant's sentence be alleged in the indictment. The indictment's failure to include the facts did not rise to the level of a jurisdictional defect. The requirements of due process under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 did, however, require that defendant be provided notice of the intent to seek a sentencing enhancement at a reasonable time before the facts supporting that enhancement were submitted to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's sentence was vacated, and the matter was remanded for resentencing. Defendant's conviction was affirmed in a separate, unpublished, opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a motion for a change of venue, which the St. Clair Circuit Court, Alabama, granted to the Elmore County Circuit Court. A jury for the trial court found defendant guilty of capital murder for intentionally causing the death of a police officer while he was on duty and recommended that he be sentenced to death. The trial court accepted the jury's recommendation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A Federal Bureau of Investigation agent informed defendant of his Miranda rights. Defendant understood his rights and agreed to speak with the agent and an investigator for the Alabama Bureau of Investigation. Defendant knowingly and voluntarily signed a form waiving his rights. Thus, the appellate court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress his confession. The appellate court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of uncharged collateral robberies that occurred after defendant's escape from the county jail. Also, the trial court did not err in admitting the photographs of the victim's body into evidence because the photographs were used to corroborate the medical examiner's testimony. Additionally, the trial court properly weighed the mitigating and aggravating circumstances when determining defendant's sentence. Finally, the trial court compared defendant's sentence to sentences imposed in similar cases and found that defendant's sentence was not disproportionate or excessive. Thus, defendant's conviction and sentence of death were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A child in need of supervision petition was filed against the appellee student based on a charge of truancy for violating the compulsory school attendance law. On its own motion, before it conducted a hearing on the petition, the Morgan County Juvenile Court (Alabama) entered an order, finding that 1999 Ala. Acts 99-705 was unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued that the juvenile court erroneously concluded that 1999 Ala. Act 99-705 violated Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 45 (1901). The State specifically contended that Ala. Code &sect;16-28-16 (amended 2000) did not amend or extend Ala. Code &sect; 16-28-3. Section 16-28-3 specified which children were required by law to attend school. In contrast, &sect; 16-28-16 provided that, with certain listed exceptions, each child who was enrolled in a public school, whether or not that child was required by law to enroll, was subject to attendance and truancy provisions. Contrary to the juvenile court's finding, the amendment to &sect; 16-28-16, did not amend or extend the provisions of Ala. Code &sect;16-28-3. Furthermore, when it amended &sect; 16-28-16, the Alabama legislature complied with the requirements of Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 45, because it reenacted and published at length that entire section. The juvenile court erroneously concluded that the act violated the state constitution and erroneously dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court reversed the juvenile court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(18), which authorized the death penalty for an intentional murder committed by firing a weapon from a vehicle. The statute did not disproportionately or arbitrarily authorize the death penalty. The trial court did not have to state the weight given to the jury's sentencing recommendation. The only objectionable statement the prosecutor made was that told the jurors they were making a sentencing recommendation, and they should not let the defense &quot;put a guilt trip&quot; on them. The comment was not objected to at trial, and its allowance was not plain error. The prosecutor's other challenged comments were not improper. The jury instructions at sentencing, viewed as a whole, correctly stated the law. The trial court did not have to instruct the jury on mitigating circumstances not relied on at sentencing. While the trial court had to consider mitigating factors offered by defendant, it was not required to find that they were mitigating. The trial court's findings made in imposing the death sentence were supported by the record, and the sentence was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) of distribution of a controlled substance and trafficking in morphine. She was given a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole on the trafficking charge. Defendant's appeal was stayed when she filed an Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition challenging the mandatory sentence. The trial court denied the petition and the case was resubmitted for appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who testified she was addicted to drugs, sold prescription drugs to an undercover officer. When the officer asked her whether she could obtain any other substances, she obtained a bottle of liquid morphine from a neighbor. The appellate court first determined that the issue of whether the life sentence amounted to cruel and unusual punishment had been preserved for review because the appellate court had sanctioned the procedural sequence. The appellate court then found that it was required to apply a narrow proportionality analysis, which required an initial determination that the sentence was grossly disproportionate to the crime. Defendant's life sentence without parole was grossly disproportionate given that it was her first offense and that Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-231 was meant to punish &quot;drug barons&quot; who habitually dealt large quantities of drugs. As defendant was the only noncapital offender with no prior felony convictions who was serving a life sentence without parole in an Alabama prison, and she would have received a much more lenient sentence in many other jurisdictions, the mandatory sentence was unconstitutional as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The life sentence was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) entered a final judgment of conviction and sentence of death after a jury convicted defendant of the murder of a deputy sheriff while the deputy was on duty or because of the deputy's official or job-related act or performance, a capital offense pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(5). Defendant appealed his conviction and death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A deputy sheriff was moonlighting as a hotel security guard. He heard a disturbance and went to investigate suspected criminal activity. He was shot twice and died. Criminal defendant was soon taken into custody. Weeks later, while in prison, another inmate helped defendant make several calls. The calls were initially placed to a young woman who allowed her three-way calling mechanism to be used so inmates could speak with several different people. The daughter consented to having her mother listen in on the calls and the mother took notes. Defendant talked on the phone about shooting the deputy in the head. Defendant was convicted of murdering a law enforcement officer, a capital offense under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(5) and the case facts. After he was sentenced to death, the appellate court found the deputy was on duty, which was one way of showing the statute applied, as he was investigating criminal activity. It also found the mother was not illegally eavesdropping and her notes could be admitted as present sense impressions. It further found ineffective assistance of counsel was not shown, the evidence supported the conviction, and the death sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment was affirmed. State could &quot;death-qualify&quot; jury, jury selection was proper and State did not misuse peremptory strikes, arguments unsupported by the record could not be reviewed, evidence was properly admitted including evidence of telephone calls defendant made from jail, evidence supported defendant's conviction, State's closing argument was proper, ineffective assistance of counsel was not shown, and sentencing was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Morgan Circuit Court, Alabama, denying his petition for postconviction relief, filed pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 32, attacking his conviction for distributing cocaine. The conviction had been affirmed on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant filed a pro se brief in which he reasserted two of the claims raised in his Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 postconviction relief petition, namely (1) that the trial court was without jurisdiction to render judgment or to impose sentence because his conviction was obtained in violation of the prohibition against double jeopardy; and (2) he was unconstitutionally convicted of an offense not charged in the indictment. Appellant's double jeopardy claim was based on his contention that he could not be prosecuted criminally for an offense as to which he had been previously subjected to civil asset forfeiture. The reviewing court found no error harmful to appellant's substantial rights. The court concluded that appellant's double jeopardy claim was precluded by Rule 32 because it could have been raised at trial and on appeal, but was not. In addition, appellant's second claim was barred by Rule 32 because the claim, which involved the variance between the indictment and the trial court's oral charge to the jury, could have been, but was not, raised at trial and on direct appeal. A misdescription of an element of the offense did not affect the trial court's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment was affirmed. Appellant's collateral challenge to his drug conviction, based upon double jeopardy implications of an asset forfeiture action, could not be raised for the first time in his postconviction petition. The variance between the indictment and oral charge was a misdescription of the elements of the offense and thus did not implicate trial court's jurisdiction. Appellant's failure to object at trial to waived this claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. Ala. R. Crim. P. 32, providing for petitions for postconviction relief, provided, in Ala. R. Crim. P. 32.2(c), that a petition for postconviction relief on constitutional grounds or alleging failure to appeal within the prescribed time, had to be filed within two years after the issuance of the certificate of judgment. Defendant filed a petition for postconviction relief nearly three years after issuance of the certificate of judgment. The limitations provision was mandatory and jurisdictional, and there were no exceptions to its application. It was not a prohibited suspension of the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2244 because it was a procedural mechanism which the state had no obligation to provide and was subject to reasonable restriction. Defendant's attempt to couch his complaint as a jurisdictional issue not subject to any statute of limitations was without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's denial of defendant's petition for postconviction relief, because it was filed outside the two-year statute of limitations, was affirmed because there were no exceptions to that limitations period for defendant's constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the petition for writ of mandamus, and ordered the lower court to reinstate the indictment. Petitioner filed the petition 35 days after the lower court dismissed the charges against defendant; thus, the petition was filed within a presumptively reasonable time. Because defendant did not respond to the allegations in the petition, the court considered the allegations to be true. Defendant exerted unauthorized control over moneys that he received from an individual with whom defendant had contracted. The court found, however, that it was for a jury to decide whether defendant had the intent to deprive the individual of the moneys.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and an accomplice raped, robbed, and murdered a 15 year-old girl. Defendant appealed his convictions of capital murder during first degree rape and during first degree robbery, and his electrocution sentence. Defendant's conviction of another capital crime before sentencing was admissible at that hearing. There was no comment on defendant's failure to testify, nor did the prosecutor incorrectly state the jury's sentencing role. Defendant waived arraignment on a second indictment substituted for the original. Defendant was not entitled to challenge jury panel members for cause who knew the victim, after they stated they could be fair and impartial. Death by electrocution was not cruel or unusual. Defendant's custodial statements to police were either voluntary or spontaneous, and, therefore, admissible. Relevant victim photographs were admissible, even if they inflamed the jury. Defendant's accomplice's testimony was corroborated, as required by Ala. Code &sect; 12-22-222 (1975), by defendant's confession and crime scene evidence. The evidence was sufficient. Defendant's intent could be inferred from his use of a deadly weapon. The conviction and sentence were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant fatally shot three persons, and attempted to kill a fourth, in connection with a drug deal. He was convicted of the capital offense of murder under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(10), and the Houston Circuit Court (Alabama) sentenced him to death. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a drug dealer with a full scale IQ of 72, confessed to the shootings. At trial, he claimed he did not intend to kill the victims, but &quot;snapped&quot; because, inter alia, he smoked crack and drank alcohol and was under duress from another drug dealer. The appellate court held that each alleged error in the guilt and jury-sentencing phase was without merit or was harmless. The trial court's findings that the confession was voluntary and that defendant was competent to stand trial were supported by the record. Though the prosecutor improperly commented on his own credibility and, in effect, gave his personal opinion of defendant's guilt, this was not plain error. But the trial court erred by rejecting Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-51(6) (substantially impaired capacity) as a mitigating circumstance solely on its finding that defendant intended to kill the victims, as intent to kill and substantially impaired capacity were not mutually exclusive. While the trial court noted that there were &quot;some&quot; statutory mitigating circumstances, it addressed only &sect; 13A-5-51(6); its failure to make specific written findings as to the existence vel non of each mitigating circumstance required remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of conviction was affirmed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for that court's review and/or reconsideration of its sentence, and for its entry of a new sentencing order. The trial court was instructed not to exclude evidence regarding one of defendant's relatives to the extent it was probative of how defendant's life had been affected by his experiences with and deficiencies of his family members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction, in the Dallas Circuit Court (Alabama), of murder made capital because it was committed during the course of a robbery in the first degree, alleging numerous constitutional and procedural errors. The appellate court reviewed the defendant's sentence in accordance with Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-51 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury found defendant guilty of capital murder, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) (1975), for the death of a man which occurred in the course of a robbery. In a bifurcated trial, the jury recommended the death sentence. Pursuant to its review under Ala. R. App. P. 45A, the appellate court reviewed all of defendant's claimed errors, whether objected to or not at the trial level, including jury selection and alleged prosecutorial misconduct, and found no error that mandated reversal. Specifically, the appellate court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence found in defendant's bedroom because defendant's mother clearly had the authority to consent to the search of her home. The appellate court further held that the trial court neither abused its discretion in limiting cross-examination of the State's witness nor in refusing defendant's requested jury instructions on complicity. Last, under its direct review of death penalty sentences, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-51 (1975), the appellate court found that the sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Conviction affirmed. The trial court did not err in denying motion to suppress evidence found after defendant's mother consented to a search and defendant was arrested. After carefully reviewing the record, the appellate court concluded that the findings and conclusions of the trial court were amply supported by the evidence and that death was the appropriate sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sentenced to death filed a petition for postconviction relief, followed by a request for production, seeking materials maintained by the prison and state department of forensic sciences regarding executions since 1976, as well as prosecutor's records regarding defendant's criminal and drug-related offenses. The trial court granted the request for production, and the state sought review by way of mandamus. Good cause was the appropriate standard by which to judge postconviction discovery motions, but the movant had to allege facts which would entitle him to relief. Request for production from prison and forensic sciences department should not have been granted because it related to defendant's claim that death by electrocution was cruel and unusual punishment, which was procedurally barred because it could have been raised at trial or on appeal. A procedurally barred claim did not entitle a movant for discovery to relief. Defendant's claim that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to reasonably investigate his background established good cause for discovery because it presented the issue of possible mitigating evidence that could have been presented to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petition for mandamus was granted as to postconviction discovery order as it applied to state prison and department of forensic sciences because defendant did not have good cause for this request, as it related to a claim which was procedurally barred, but was denied as to prosecutor because defendant did have good cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged the judgment from the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), convicting and sentencing him for distribution of a controlled substance, trafficking in cocaine, and two counts of failure to affix tax stamps.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellant was charged with, and convicted of, distribution of a controlled substance, trafficking in cocaine, and two counts of failure to affix tax stamps. Appellant challenged the convictions. This appeal addressed both the trial on remand as to whether the actions of the prosecutor were meant to provoke a mistrial and the trial that resulted in the appellant's convictions. There was no evidence that the prosecutor intended to prejudice the appellant or to provoke a mistrial. As to the appellant's attack on his convictions, persons who traffic in mixtures of cocaine and marijuana were treated similarly; therefore equal protection of the laws was not violated. The appellant's requested instruction that, with regard to the trafficking case, the appellant must have had knowledge that the amount of cocaine being sold exceeded 28 grams, was not a correct statement of the law. The trial court properly denied the appellant's motion for a judgment of acquittal. The judgment of the trial court on remand, holding that the prosecutor's misconduct was not intended to provoke a mistrial, was affirmed. The appellant's convictions and sentences were likewise affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Convictions and sentences were affirmed, as well as judgment of the trial court that prosecutor's conduct was not intended to provoke a mistrial. Drug trafficking statute did not violate the equal protection clause, appellant's requested jury instruction was not a correct statement of the law, and evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the summary denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Escambia Circuit Court, Alabama, based upon his assertion that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in Montgomery Circuit Court of trafficking in cocaine and was sentenced as a habitual felony offender to life in prison without parole. Defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Escambia Circuit Court, claiming that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over him. Escambia Circuit Court summarily denied the petition. On appeal from the denial, the court noted that defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus should have been treated as an Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 petition because the claims made in the petition challenged his conviction. The court then held that the circuit court in which the petition was filed, Escambia, did not have jurisdiction to dispose of the petition, and reversed and remanded the case to that circuit court with directions to transfer the petition to the Montgomery Circuit Court, which could address defendant's issues, which were cognizable in a Rule 32 petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded the cause with directions that the circuit court transfer the petition to the circuit court of original jurisdiction, in which defendant was convicted, which would have had proper jurisdiction over what was not actually a habeas petition but rather an improperly labeled rule 32 petition.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied. There were numerous issues raised on appeal, including: venue, voir dire, the prosecution's closing arguments, jury instructions, Brady materials, discovery, victim and autopsy photographs, Miranda warnings, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evidence and chain of custody, expert testimony, due process, double jeopardy, and lesser-included offense instructions. The appellate court affirmed. Because it was a capital case and even though defendant did not timely object to many assignments of error, the court reviewed for, but found no plain error. To correct certain errors and omissions in the trial court's sentencing order, the case was remanded for new findings regarding each of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and to determine whether the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. No new resentencing hearing was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State appealed from the judgment of the Montgomery Juvenile Court (Alabama), which granted appellee's motion to suppress evidence seized from the appellee after an arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When asked by a police officer, appellee gave a false age. When asked for identification, appellee admitted to being 16. Appellee was arrested under Montgomery, Ala., Municipal Code &sect; 29-18 for making a false statement to police. During a search of appellee's purse, the officer discovered marijuana. Appellee was arrested and charged with second-degree possession of marijuana under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-214 (1975). Appellee moved to suppress the evidence discovered in her purse and the district court granted the motion on the ground that the city ordinance was unconstitutional. Appellant State appealed and judgment was reversed and remanded. The city ordinance was not inconsistent with the state law and the state law did not contain any exclusivity provisions. Furthermore, the city ordinance merely expanded upon the statute by providing that making any false statement in a matter within the jurisdiction of a city department or agency was an offense. Accordingly, the juvenile court improperly granted the appellee's motion to suppress. Appellee was lawfully arrested, and the warrantless search of her purse was a valid search incident to her arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment was reversed and remanded. The juvenile court improperly granted appellee's motion to suppress. The city ordinance was not inconsistent with state law because the state law did not contain any exclusivity provisions. Because the ordinance merely enlarged the provisions of the state law and did not prohibit an activity that the state law specifically allowed, it was not inconsistent with the state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his convictions and death sentence, entered by the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama), where he was convicted of two counts of capital murder because the killings occurred during a first-degree robbery, one count of capital murder because the killings involved the murder of two or more persons by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, and one count of capital murder as one victim was less than age 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was charged with four counts of capital murder for killing a man and his 11-year old son. Two counts of capital murder were charged because the killings occurred during a first-degree robbery, one capital murder count was lodged since the killings involved the murder of two or more persons by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, and one count of capital murder was because one of the victims was less than 14 years old. Appellant and four codefendants planned to steal some vehicles. A man and his 11-year old son with a vehicle were parked at a boat landing. Appellant and one other codefendant ordered the two victims into the victims' boat, drove them downstream, and shot them to death. A jury convicted appellant on all charges. It recommended a life imprisonment sentence. The trial court instead sentenced appellant to death. Appellant challenged his convictions and death sentence. The court affirmed. None of the allegations raised regarding jury issues, admission of evidence, prosecutorial misconduct, sufficiency of evidence, sentencing, and propriety of the death penalty warranted reversal of the convictions or death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgments and sentences affirmed because none of the multiple issues appellant raised on appeal demonstrated either plain error or a defect in the proceedings occurred in either the guilt or sentencing phases of his trial. The trial court's findings and conclusions were amply supported by the evidence. No evidence existed the sentence was the result of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor, and the death sentence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury unanimously recommended death for appellant's murder-rape conviction. The trial court subsequently sentenced appellant to death. The trial court did not give any instructions informing the jury as to the burdens of proof for the aggravating circumstances evidence. The jury's consideration of any aggravating circumstance, besides those established during the guilt/innocence phase was invalid because it was not guided by sufficient instruction, i.e., an instruction that the prosecution had to convince each juror beyond a reasonable doubt as to the existence of any aggravating circumstance. Also, as a matter of state law, appellant was entitled to appropriate instructions on mitigating circumstances. Taking all the instructional errors cumulatively, the appellate court was constrained to find that the jury was without sufficient guidance to make a proper determination of the presence or absence of any proposed aggravating circumstance or of any offered mitigating circumstance. Thus, the court remanded appellant's case for a sentencing hearing before a properly instructed jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Case remanded for resentencing; appellant was sentenced to death for his murder-rape conviction. Jury charge on aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not inform the jury regarding the proper burdens of proof.

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, and the sentences were to run concurrently. Because the maximum sentence for a Class C misdemeanor such as disorderly conduct was three months under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-7(a)(3), the case was remanded for resentencing on that charge. Appellant argued that she did not intend to cause &quot;public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm,&quot; that she did not use obscene language, and that a prima facie case was not proven. The State's witnesses provided sufficient evidence of those factors and her &quot;unreasonable noise&quot; to submit the case to the jury. Evidence appellant proffered concerning the reasons for her behavior at the police station were properly excluded as not relevant under Ala. R. Evid. 403. Her argument that the disorderly conduct statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 13A-11-7, violated U.S. Const. amend. I was not raised at trial and was therefore waived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's convictions were affirmed because she did not raise her free speech arguments at trial, the jury's holdings were credible, and the evidence defendant proffered concerning the reasons for her behavior at the police station was cumulative, hearsay, and did not establish a complete defense.

Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence, arguing he should not have been denied the opportunity to present an entrapment defense, the State did not prove the sales occurred within three miles of a school or housing project, and the enhancement violated his constitutional rights. The court found defendant was given multiple opportunities to present evidence that he was not disposed to committing the crime before being approached by police and failed to do so.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant felon shot and killed a gas station attendant during the course of a robbery, having planned the felony several weeks in advance. Appellant was convicted of the capital offense of murder during the course of a robbery pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) (1975) and sentenced to death. Appellant challenged both the conviction and the sentence, alleging 20 assignments of error. As required by Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-53, the court addressed the propriety of appellant's conviction and sentence to death by electrocution. The court affirmed appellant's conviction of capital murder and sentence to death. The grand jury had jurisdiction to issue the second indictment. Because appellant did not consent to the amended indictment, the proper procedure was followed in sending the case back to the grand jury to issue a new, second indictment. Appellant's challenges for cause of potential jurors were properly denied; the jurors demonstrated that they could adhere to the law as instructed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant filed an appeal from the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) which ordered his conviction and sentence for the capital offense of murder during a robbery and for intentional murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was indicted for three counts of capital murder, and later sentenced to death. On appeal, he raised several points of error. The court affirmed his conviction for capital murder. Upon review, the court found no error occurred in the admission of DNA evidence at trial, because the trial court considered the reliability and relevance of the evidence. The testimony of an agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who believed the offense was sexually motivated, was properly admitted under Ala. R. Evid. 702. The agent testified that he had specialized knowledge in crime scene analysis and victimology. Given the task before the jury, the probative value of the agent's testimony outweighed its prejudicial impact. Further, photographs of the victim's body were admissible to illustrate how the crime occurred; they were not unduly prejudicial. Appellant's Batson challenges were denied, because no inference was raised that the State engaged in purposeful racial discrimination in its use of peremptory challenges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed conviction for capital murder. No error occurred in the admission of contested evidence. Conviction for the lesser-included offense of intentional murder was vacated and the matter remanded so appellant's sentence for intentional murder conviction could be set aside.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged the Jefferson Circuit Court's (Alabama) judgment denying his motion to dismiss, finding him guilty of unlawful distribution of a controlled substance, sentencing him to life imprisonment as a habitual offender, and enhancing his sentence with two additional five-year terms, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-250, -270 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Undercover officer bought narcotics from appellant. Appellant's trial began over four and one-half years after his arrest. No motions for continuance or other delay was requested by State. Therefore, the delay should not weigh against State. Appellant failed to assert his right to a speedy trial for approximately three years and seven months. Because appellant was tried within 15 months of his first assertion of his right to a speedy trial, the delay should not have weighed heavily against State. Appellant failed to show that he suffered any actual prejudice from the delay. Therefore, the trial court properly denied appellant's motion to dismiss for failure to grant a speedy trial. Appellant's life imprisonment sentence and the two five-year enhancements were mandatory under Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13A-5-9(c)(2), 13A-12-250, 13A-12-270. Therefore, appellant's sentence was clearly within the statutory range, it was not unconstitutional, and the court would not overturn the sentence.</SPAN></P>

Appellant failed to show that delay in trial should be weigh against State and that he suffered prejudice from delay; therefore, denial of motion to dismiss for failure to grant a speedy trial was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction of capital murder and death sentence on grounds that he was denied: right to counsel, treatment as youthful offender, full mental examination, right to confront witnesses for non-presence at pretrial, motion to suppress statements in violation of Miranda rights, and motion for mistrial for jury tampering. He also claimed that there was improper removal of black jurors from venire, prosecutorial misconduct, and error for allowing evidence of collateral crimes. Defendant appealed death penalty sentence as improper because defendant was not shooter and court double counted charges. The court affirmed defendant's conviction because no plain error was found in guilt or sentencing proceedings before the jury. The court remanded as to sentencing, finding error because no prior conviction was found to negate existence of statutory mitigating circumstance of no significant prior criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, convicted of capital murder, appealed from a judgment of the Macon Circuit Court (Alabama), which sentenced him to death by electrocution because the murders occurred during the course of a robbery and involved the killing of two or more people during one act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, convicted of murder, raised several issues on appeal. The court affirmed both conviction and death sentence, holding that a search warrant technical errors did not result in constitutional violations, nor invalidate the search. Additionally, the affidavit supporting the search warrant was thorough; it established probable cause for police to believe the murder weapon was in appellant's apartment, thus, evidence was properly admitted. After reviewing the record, the court concluded that appellant's right to cross-examine the expert witness regarding his DNA testimony was not limited in any respect. Since the identity of the murderer was at issue, evidence of another shooting was admitted to establish appellant's connection to the murder weapon. The trial court properly instructed the jury that it did not need to unanimously find mitigating circumstances. The court independently weighed aggravating and mitigating circumstances, determining that the death sentence was appropriate for appellant's conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment affirmed. Technical error on the search warrant did not result in constitutional violations or invalidate police search. Since identity of the murderer was at issue, evidence of other shooting was admitted to establish appellant's connection to the murder weapon.</SPAN></P>
