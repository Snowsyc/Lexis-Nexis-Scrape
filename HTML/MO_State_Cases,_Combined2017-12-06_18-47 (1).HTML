The supreme court held that &sect; 632.498 (Supp. 2006) applied to the relator's case. Thus, the preliminary writ of mandamus previously issued was quashed. Under the amended statute, the State had the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the committed person's mental abnormality remained such that the person was not safe to be at large and if released was likely to engage in acts of sexual violence. Section 632.498 (Supp. 2006) did not look at past conduct. The retrial hearing to determine whether the relator could be released evaluated his current condition. The jury needed to determined if, at the time of retrial, the relator remained a SVP. Contrary to the relator's assertions, the amendments to &sect; 632.498 (Supp. 2006) were prospective in nature, not retrospective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 67.2555 (Supp. 2005) violated the special law prohibition in Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30). It did not address respondent Jackson County's various other constitutional challenges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court declared Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 67.2555 an unconstitutional special law and permanently enjoined its enforcement. The supreme court found that the presumption of constitutionality of the statute would not be rebutted because the population range in the statute (100,000) was a significant portion (14.3%) of the upper population limit in the statute (700,000). The population range was not sufficiently broad to invoke the exception. There were no counties similar in size to Jackson County. There was a rational reason for the classification as only three counties currently had a constitutional form of government, and there were already checks on executive spending in the other two counties. The statute was permitted by Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 18(b) as it prescribed that the county executive must competitively bid certain expenditures. The inclusion of the statute in HB 58 did not violate the single subject requirement and there was no finding that any provision in HB 58 violated the original purpose doctrine. The county could not bring a vagueness challenge as it was not a &quot;person&quot; under the due process clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, granted summary judgment in favor of respondents, government officials and others (state), on appellant Jefferson County Fire Protection Districts Association and its member fire protection districts' (fire districts) suit seeking a declaration that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 321.222 (Supp. 2005) violated the prohibition against special legislation under Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30). The fire districts appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 321.222 only applied to Jefferson County, the only county with a population between 198,000 and 199,2000. The population range in the statute (1200) was a tiny fraction (.6%) of the upper population limit in the statute of 199,2000. The only apparent reason the statute had a population range that represented only .6% of the upper population limit was to exclude all counties other than Jefferson. Thus, &sect; 321.222 was presumed to be a special law. The state did not offer substantial jurisdiction for eliminating the dual regulatory system in only Jefferson County and not other counties where the statute eliminated the need for the permit from the fire protection district and reduced the burden of duplicative permits on residential builders and home buyers. However, home buyers and residential builders in every county with a chapter 321 fire protection district were subject to dual regulation. The state did now show how Jefferson County's suburban/rural mix was significantly different from other counties. The state did not show substantial justification for the narrow population range in &sect; 321.222.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and judgment was entered in favor of the fire districts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for beating the six-year-old victim to death. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's Batson challenges to the State's peremptory strikes of an African-American male juror and an Asian female juror because defendant failed to show that the State's reasons for striking the jurors were pretextual and that the strikes were racially motivated. The State used each of its peremptory strikes to strike jurors without minor children, including white jurors who did not have children. It was logical for the State to believe that the African-American juror's work with the Division of Youth Services might make him more sympathetic to defendant, and the State was concerned that the Asian juror's occupation as a student caused her to lack sufficient life experiences he would prefer in jurors. The trial court did not err by not allowing defense counsel's questions during voir dire that asked jurors whether, knowing that first-degree murder was a coolly-reflected-upon, deliberated killing, they could consider a sentence of life in prison without probation or parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the State and a State Senator challenged a decision of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which held that the portion of Missouri Senate Bill 1014 (SB 1014) requiring presentation of certain forms of photographic identification (ID) to vote was unconstitutional in respondents' action to block enforcement of the law on the grounds that it interfered with the right to vote.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents claimed that the new law required voters - particularly those who were low-income and did not have driver's licenses - to spend money to obtain the necessary documents in order to obtain the requisite photo ID. The court affirmed, and held that SB 1014's ID requirement violated Missouri's equal protection clause, Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, and the guarantee of the right to vote under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 25, art. VIII, &sect; 2. In practical effect, the only documents that most Missourians would have that could meet the requirements were a Missouri driver's or non-driver's license or a United States passport. The record supported the trial court's determination that SB 1014's requirement placed a burden on the right of Missourians to vote. In light of the substantial burden that the ID requirement placed upon the right to vote, the statute was subject to strict scrutiny, and while Missouri's broad interests in preserving the integrity of the election process were compelling, the evidence demonstrated that the ID requirement was not &quot;necessary&quot; to accomplish this goal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Greene County (Missouri), which entered judgment in favor of respondent taxpayer in a dispute over the constitutionality of the Missouri Municipal Telecommunications Business License Simplification Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92.074 to 92.095 (Supp. 2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city contended that the taxpayer, a communications company, had not paid most of its gross receipt taxes due under Springfield, Mo., Code &sect; 20-146 (1981). During the pendency of city's collection suit, the Act was passed, which created a fixed category of cities that were exempt from the specific taxation restrictions placed on all other cities. The trial court upheld the Act as constitutional, and the city sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92.086.10 (Supp. 2005) violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&nbsp;40(30), which prohibited special laws. It based the exemption on an immutable, historical fact - whether a city had adopted and enforced its tax prior to January 15, 2005 - and substantial justification for failure to enact a general law in lieu of a special law was not shown. Because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92.092 (Supp. 2005) expressed the Missouri Legislature's intent that if any provision or part of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 92.074 to 92.089 was invalid, all of those sections of the Act were invalid, &sect;&sect; 92.074 to 92.089 were invalid in their entirety.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant cities sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which dismissed their action against respondent wireless provider seeking to enforce the application of their taxes to the wireless service the provider had supplied to its customers. The claims involved the Municipal Telecommunications Business License Tax Simplification Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;92.074 to 92.095 (Supp. 2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the cities was a third-class city and the other was a fourth-class city. The provider argued that the cities had no right to sue in their own names, but rather that under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 94.150 and 94.310 (2000) suit had to be brought in the name of the state for the use and benefit of the city collector. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in holding that &sect; 94.310 required fourth-class cities to bring suit in the name of the state. It contained no such requirement. While Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 94.150 did require third-class cities to sue for &quot;city taxes&quot; in the name of the state, failure to do so could be corrected by amendment and did not deprive the plaintiff of standing. Moreover, the license taxes sought by the cities were not &quot;city taxes&quot; as that term was used in &sect; 94.150, and so, the third-class city could sue in its own name. Accordingly, the court could reach the cities' constitutional challenges to the Act. Addressing the merits of the action, the court determined that, based on its holding in a companion case, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 92.074 to 92.089 (Supp. 2005) were invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The residents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents argued that enforcement of Megan's Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 589.400 to 589.425 (Supp. 2005), should be enjoined under Missouri's Constitution even if it did not violate comparable provisions of the United States equal protection, due process or ex post facto clauses. The supreme court noted that, because no provision of the federal constitution was comparable to Missouri's ban on laws retrospective in their operation, Mo. Const. art. 1, &sect;13, federal decisions provided no guide to the supreme court's interpretation of that clause. Megan's Law bore a rational relation to the legitimate state interest of the safety of children and was not violative of substantive due process principles. The distinction between sex offenders and those whose crimes did not involve such elements was rational given the higher risk of recidivism of such individuals and the nature of the crimes involved. Megan's Law did violate the constitutional bar on laws retrospective in operation where it required the residents to fulfill a new obligation and imposed a new duty to register and to maintain and update the registration regularly, based solely on their offenses prior to its enactment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to the registration requirements of Megan's Law as to those persons who were convicted or pled guilty prior to the law's January 1, 1995, effective date; all other provisions remained in effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged SVP chose not to testify at his civil commitment trial. The State declined to call him as a witness but used the fact that he did not testify against him. On appeal, the court determined that the trial court erred in permitting the State to argue an adverse inference from the alleged SVP's decision not to testify. The court rejected the State's argument that all procedures and evidentiary rules applicable to SVP proceedings were contained in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 632.492 and 632.495 (2000), without reference to the general civil commitment statutes or to the court's decisions and evidentiary rules. The State did identify a compelling State interest in obtaining the cooperation and testimony of alleged SVPs so as to enhance the reliability of the fact-finder's decisionmaking. The State, however, chose not to call the alleged SVP, instead arguing an adverse inference from his failure to testify. That did not further the compelling interest identified by the State and was not narrowly tailored to accomplish that purpose. Last, the court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the testimony of a licensed social worker.</SPAN></P>

The lienholder sought injunctive relief to prevent DOR from issuing abandoned home titles under the Act, claiming that its provisions violated respondents' due process rights and were unconstitutionally vague. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the lienholder, holding the Act was unconstitutional because it was confiscatory and violated the Due Process Clause and was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed. It ruled that &sect; 700.531 made it the specific obligation of DOR to notify both the homeowner and the lienholder of the alleged abandonment of the home and the landlord's application for title. Both parties were entitled to adequate notice. The court noted that DOR never attempted to rectify the due process inadequacies in the statute by issuing regulations requiring adequate notice or a pre-deprivation hearing for the homeowner. The homeowners were entitled to a hearing before their property interests were disturbed.</SPAN></P>

Defendants moved for dismissal on the basis of workers' compensation laws, including Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.120 (2000). The trial court overruled both motions, and the appellate court denied both writ applications. The court issued a preliminary writ of prohibition regarding the employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son was killed during a repair of the employer's electrical line. The parents claimed that the case was removed from the exclusive jurisdiction of the workers' compensation law because the supervisor did something extra beyond a breach of general supervision. The court noted that the law provided the exclusive remedy against employers for injuries covered by its provisions. The petition admitted that the son was an employee of the employer, that his duties included repairing the employer's electric lines, and that he was killed while repairing those lines. Thus, any rights against the employer arising directly from the son's death belonged within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission pursuant to the workers' compensation law. The court next decided that the issue of whether the case fell outside the scope of the workers' compensation law if the injury was the result of an intentional act by the employer was issue for the Commission, not the courts. Finally, the court rejected the parents' argument that the workers' compensation law violated Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 14, by precluding them from seeking relief against the employer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for beating the victim to death. On appeal, the court held that the motion court did not clearly err in denying defendant's postconviction motion based on his claim that he was mentally retarded, and therefore ineligible for the death penalty, because his claim was refuted by the record and therefore he was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue. Three highly qualified experts testified at trial that defendant was not retarded, and there was no evidence to the contrary. Counsel's selection of expert witnesses at trial was not a matter that defendant could not be successfully challenge in a Rule 29.15 proceeding, and defendant failed to show that he was retarded under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.030.6 (2000). Counsel was not ineffective for failing to investigate or challenge the actual time and reason that defendant moved out of a boardinghouse, which was next door to the victim's home, because it would be speculation for the witnesses to testify that defendant did not hold a grudge against the victim based on evidence that defendant's rent was paid through October, that he was not evicted in August, or that they helped him move out in October.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislator argued that the legislature violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 23 in passing Mo. H.B. 58.

The supreme court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115.348 applied equally to candidates in statewide elections. Both Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 115.013 and 115.019 did not affect statewide entities or activities. Section 115.348 was constitutionally invalid in that it exceeded the scope of H.B. 58's declared subject--legislation relating to political subdivisions. The provisions of the bill that specifically related to political subdivisions were not so dependent upon &sect; 115.348, prohibiting federal criminals from running for public office, that it could not be presumed the legislature would have passed the bill without it.

The juvenile officer proceeded with his case by calling the detective who had first investigated the allegations. He asked the detective what the alleged victim had told him during his investigation. The detective recounted the statements made to him by the alleged victim; however, the juvenile officer was not allowed to introduced the child's videotaped testimony. The juvenile officer argued that the ruling rejecting the videotaped testimony could be reviewed as an interlocutory appeal. Although that ruling could have been properly appealed under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.261 (2000) at an earlier stage of the proceedings, that was not the present case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city refused to approve the developer's subdivision plat application under Kansas City, Mo., Code of Ordinances &sect; 66-43. After a judgment in mandamus was entered and damages were awarded, the city sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the trial court did not exceed the scope of permissible review by using the de novo standard. First, the city failed to show that any prejudice resulted in the admission of evidence under this standard of review. Further, the parties were not allowed to create a record upon which a viable review could be had. Next, there was substantial evidence from which the trial court could have found that the developer complied with the local zoning subdivision ordinances. Also, the city denied the plat, despite being informed that there was no legal basis for that decision. Moreover, the city acted in a clearly irrational manner in the context of substantive due process because this was the only plat application that was denied, no reasons were given, and the developer was subjected to numerous delays.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a health services agency, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Boone County (Missouri), which determined that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 188.039 (2003) did not violate the Missouri Constitution. All of the agency's federal claims were reserved for adjudication in federal court. Section 188.039 created an informed consent requirement, including a 24-hour waiting period before elective abortions could be performed in Missouri.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency argued that the act was unconstitutional for vagueness. It also argued that the 24-hour waiting provision violated liberty and privacy rights under the Missouri Constitution. On appeal, the court rejected both arguments. It first determined that &sect; 188.039 imposed no duty regarding the extent of consultation between a physician and a patient seeking an abortion additional to that already required by common law, a duty that had been recognized under the law for almost 100 years. The statute was not vague because, aside from the 24-hour waiting requirement, &sect; 188.039 placed no further duty upon Missouri physicians than was already imposed at common law. The statute merely codified the physician's duty to obtain informed consent from a patient prior to an abortion and created criminal or disciplinary liability if the physician knowingly failed to fulfill that duty. The statute was also not void for vagueness. Finally, the court noted that a 24-hour waiting period, before terminating a pregnancy, did not violate the federal constitution. There was no reason to construe Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 10 more broadly than the due process guarantee in U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the parties' original 1999 parenting plan the father only had visitation rights with the children.

The parties and a guardian ad litem submitted a proposed judgment to the court indicating that they had agreed to joint physical and legal custody. The judgment was signed in July 2003. The mother subsequently filed her present motion pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 74.06 and alleged the trial court did not have jurisdiction to make its ruling as it did not hold an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;452.410 before issuing its judgment. The state supreme court affirmed and held that to the extent Missouri case law suggested a hearing was required by &sect;&nbsp;452.410 even where the court found that the stipulated facts were sufficient to allow it to determine that a change of circumstances had occurred and that a modification of custody was in the best interests of the children, those cases were incorrect and should no longer be followed.</SPAN></P>

Respondent, the Director of Revenue, disallowed the credit and assessed a deficiency. On appeal, the corporation argued that the AHC erred in denying it a credit for either the Missouri personal income tax paid by its shareholders on their the corporation income or the Missouri corporate income tax the corporation would have paid were it a C corporation. The court determined that the plain language of &sect; 148.140.3 gave the corporation tax credits against the credit institution tax for &quot;taxes paid.&quot; The corporation could not claim such a credit for taxes it did not pay. The corporation did not pay Missouri personal income tax, its shareholders did. The corporation, as an S corporation, did not pay Missouri corporate income tax. Because the corporation did not pay Missouri income tax, it could not claim Missouri income tax as a credit under &sect; 148.140.3.

The supreme court disagreed. The jury heard the ex-wife's testimony when the transcript was read during the third trial. They knew that she had lied under oath before and continued to change her allegations. The jury knew that she wrote love letters to the petitioner while he was in prison and after the alleged abuse. That was a reasonable item for the jury to consider in evaluating her testimony. The probative content of the letters beyond that, however, was minimal. The exclusion of the letters did not prejudice the petitioner because the letters simply showed how the ex-wife expressed her sexual desire and love for the petitioner. The content of the letters would not have mitigated the offense. Moreover, the value of the testimony would have been devalued by the sexual content included in the letters had they been admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted to planning with his accomplice the murder of the victim to gain access to the victim's bank account, abducting the victim, driving the victim to a secluded location, digging the victim's grave, being present when the victim was shot and killed, and using the victim's bank card to withdraw money. However, defendant contended that it was the accomplice who shot and killed the victim. The state supreme court found that (1) the disjunctive verdict directors were properly submitted as to whether it was defendant or his accomplice who shot the victim; (2) the disjunctive verdict directors for armed criminal action were proper, and it was unnecessary to use accomplice liability language; (3) the statutory aggravating circumstances under Mo. Rev.

The appellate court found that the Act did not require that the ten-percent amount be in existence before the action was filed. Given the fixed amount in his account and the inmate's monthly income, good cause existed to recover assets. The inmate's claim that due process required a post-deprivation hearing to provide an opportunity to show good cause did not exist. The claim was not raised at the first opportunity and was not preserved. The inmate's argument that the Act was unconstitutionally vague as to what assets should be considered to determine good cause was not raised at the first opportunity and was not preserved. The statutes were not vague. So long as good cause existed that sufficient assets were available, the court was to adjudicate the proper amount. There was no authority holding that a disability pension was a fundamental right or liberty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sheriff's deputies seized approximately 120 severely malnourished and emaciated horses from the owner's property. On appeal, the court first noted that whether the spoliation doctrine would apply in future criminal proceedings against the owner was a matter that would be determined by the circuit court hearing that case. It therefore rejected the owner's argument that the spoliation doctrine applied to warrant an extraordinary writ. The court then addressed the owner's contention that &sect; 578.018 was unconstitutionally vague and violated equal protection. The court determined that the statutory definitions of &quot;animal abuse&quot; and &quot;animal neglect&quot; in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 578.009 and 578.012 were not void for vagueness. Section 578.018 provided the circuit courts with sufficient guidance to avoid arbitrary and discriminatory application and was not void on that basis. The court next noted that the owner did not allege that &sect; 578.018 discriminated based upon a classification nor did he allege that the statute discriminated in its application. Section 578.018 applied to all persons equally without regard to classification and, therefore, did not violate the guarantee of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed, holding that while the company, like any purchaser, was free to have items shipped from out-of-state to any local Missouri jurisdiction, just as it was free to purchase items from any local taxing jurisdiction within the state, for commerce clause purposes the lower courts had to compare the use and sales tax charged by a single taxing jurisdiction to determine whether the use tax was compensatory. So long as, within each taxing jurisdiction, an item purchased from an out-of-state vendor would never be taxed at a higher tax than would be charged had the item been purchased from a vendor in that locality, there was no undue burden on interstate commerce. Because Missouri's use tax statutes required local use taxes to be limited to an amount that was compensatory for any local sales tax imposed, they were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court affirmed, stating that his allegation of prosecutorial misconduct was without merit. The State did violate Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 25.03 because it not conceal the whereabouts or statements of the inmate's cellmate or girlfriend such that his counsel was prevented from adequately investigating their statements and credibility. Further, the prosecution had no obligation to disclose evidence of which the defense was already aware and which the defense could acquire. Counsel was not ineffective for declining to investigate and introduce inadmissible evidence and counsel was also not ineffective for deciding not to introduce cumulative evidence and in not requesting a limiting instruction because it was a matter of trial strategy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner had one run-in with the law in which he pled guilty to stealing in 1991 and received a suspended sentence.

On appeal, the court held that the equitable powers of the courts to offer a remedy for expunging arrest records had been eliminated by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 610.126 (2000), which required that the six requirements of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 610.122 be satisfied for expungement. The court held that petitioner failed to meet three of the requirements under &sect; 610.122 because his arrest was not based on false information or in an absence of probable cause and he had received a suspended sentence. The court also held that &sect; 610.122 was not an unconstitutional ex post facto law because it dealt only with arrest records currently maintained and did not affect conduct previously committed, therefore &sect; 610.122 did not did not need to be construed as limited to post-enactment proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Louis City (Missouri), which convicted him of four counts of sexual misconduct involving a child by indecent exposure, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.083.1(1). The charges arose from the exposure of defendant's genitals to minor boys in a school restroom.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stood at a little further distance from the urinal than men usually do. Defendant accidentally turned around without zipping his pants zipper up to discipline some boys that were causing a disturbance in the restroom. The court first noted that it had jurisdiction because defendant challenged the validity of a state statute. The court determined that the guilty verdict on all four counts had to be reversed because the evidence adduced was insufficient to convict defendant of any of the charges. The court found that while there was no question that defendant knowingly exposed his genitals to persons under the age of 14, such action was often necessary in a men's restroom. The court found the evidence was insufficient to prove that defendant exposed his genitals in a manner that would have caused a reasonable adult to believe that such conduct was likely to cause affront or alarm to a child less than 14 years of age. In addition, the court determined that &sect; 566.083.1(1) was unconstitutional. The court noted that a person's right to use public restrooms was about as fundamental a right as one could imagine, the overbreadth doctrine extended to the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter with directions to enter judgment of acquittal on all counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Platte County, Missouri, convicted defendant of driving while intoxicated, driving while revoked, and following another vehicle too closely. The court had overruled defendant's motion to suppress and motion to declare Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.023&nbsp;unconstitutional. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's driving while intoxicated charge was enhanced to a felony under &sect; 577.023 based on two prior convictions, one for a state law violation and one for a municipal ordinance violation where the judge was a lawyer. Defendant argued that the disparate treatment applied to defendants with prior convictions before a lawyer judge violated the equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court disagreed. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.023's lawyer-judge classification related to a legitimate state interest, providing defendants with the protection of a judge fully trained in the law, and thus was constitutional under the rational basis test. Section 577.023 also did not violate a defendant's substantive due process rights by allowing a penalty enhancement based on a prior constitutional municipal conviction. The court found that the stop was constitutionally permissible as the trooper had a reasonable suspicion that defendant had committed at least one traffic violation after observing defendant following another vehicle by one car length and crossing the fog line on two occasions. There was also sufficient evidence to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist was the driver of a vehicle that struck another car in which the passenger was riding. A jury rendered a verdict in the passenger's favor, but the motorist sought to have the verdict reduced by the amount of insurance benefits the passenger received. The trial court refused to credit the judgment for the underinsured motorist (UIM) benefits the passenger received. The trial court also refused to eliminate prejudgment interest. On appeal, the court affirmed. The motorist did not cite any authority for using the collateral source rule to obtain a post-judgment credit against a verdict. Thus, the trial court not err in refusing to credit the verdict accordingly. The trial court did not err in awarding the passenger prejudgment interest under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 408.040.2 (2000). The phrase &quot;in tort actions&quot; was not intended to qualify when the offer was to be made, and thus it was immaterial that the passenger's offer was made before he filed an action against the motorist. The motorist waived other issues because they were not raised in the trial court. Plain error review under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 84.13(c) was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.498 (2000), of showing probable cause to believe that he was safe to be at large and would not reoffend upon release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that the burden of &sect; 632.498 required him to do the impossible: prove that he absolutely, with certainty, would be safe and would not reoffend if released. The Supreme Court of Missouri rejected his hyper-technical reading of the words &quot;is&quot; and &quot;will not.&quot; Section 632.498, read as a whole, did not require the inmate to prove that he was absolutely certain not to reoffend in order to be entitled to a second hearing. While the State's experts thought he was still an SVP, whether or not they, rather than the inmate's experts, were correct presented a triable issue of fact. The court held that the record unequivocally showed that the inmate had made an initial probable cause showing that he was no longer an SVP. His experts clearly offered sufficient evidence to meet the probable cause standard and raise a triable issue on the question whether he was more likely than not to engage in acts of sexual violence if released. It was incumbent upon the trial court not to have made credibility determinations or weighed and balanced that expert testimony with the evidence offered by the State, but rather to have set the matter for the further hearing required by &sect; 632.498.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the case was remanded for the further hearing before a judge or jury as fact finder to determine whether the inmate should continue to be confined as an SVP.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Missouri State Board, filed two complaints seeking to discipline appellant, a physician specializing in obstetrics and gynecology. The Administrative Hearing Commission concluded that there was cause for discipline under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 334.100.2(5) (2000). The board imposed discipline that included a ban from the practice of obstetrics. The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, affirmed the decision. The physician appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This disciplinary action arose from the physician's care of a pregnant woman. She delivered a stillborn child with the umbilical cord wrapped around its neck. To demonstrate that the physician has committed gross negligence, the board had to show that he engaged in a gross deviation from the standard of care. The commission's decision to discipline him under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 334.100.2 (2000) was not supported by substantial evidence. The doctor's sticky notes were properly excluded as medical record documentation because they contained hearsay. None of the expert witnesses testified that the physician was grossly negligent. The record negated a causal link between the physician's conduct and the harm to the baby. An expert believed the baby's death was caused by strangulation by the umbilical cord and that the physician was not negligent. The autopsy supported this position. The board did not prove that the physician was incompetent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Pemiscot County (Missouri), which convicted her of failing to cause her child to attend school &quot;regularly&quot; in violation of Missouri's compulsory school attendance law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.031 (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the phrase &quot;attend school regularly&quot; as used in &sect; 167.031.1 was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that it was inappropriate and premature for it to address the constitutional issue raised. Instead, the court noted that where a statute did not itself set forth a culpable mental state, then under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 562.021.3 (2000), the State was required to establish that the person acted knowingly or purposely. While defendant's child had missed 40 days of school over two semesters, all but 17 of those absences were noted on her record to have resulted from either illness or a doctor's appointment. No contrary evidence was presented that defendant did know that, despite the excused nature of most of her child's absences due to physical incapacity caused by her pregnancy, her absences could put her in violation of the compulsory attendance laws, or that she otherwise caused the excessive absences. Thus, the State had failed to establish that defendant acted purposely or knowingly in failing to cause her child to attend school regularly and therefore had failed to prove an essential element of the crime. Double jeopardy precluded retrial of defendant.</SPAN></P>

The trial court bifurcated her trial. After the jury was unable to agree on an appropriate sentence during the penalty phase, the trial court sentenced defendant to 20 years in prison. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in refusing to admit a photograph into evidence that allegedly demonstrated defendant's boyfriend's vantage point from the kitchen of their apartment while he watched defendant shaking the child in the living room. The court further found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow defense counsel to cross-examine a doctor who treated the victim and a doctor who conducted the autopsy about profile evidence: scientific studies and statistics concerning the propensities of different types of persons to abuse children. The clear inference from the evidence would have been that defendant's boyfriend was more likely to be responsible for the child's injuries than defendant. Finally, the court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 557.036.3 (Supp. 2003), which provided for a bifurcated trial, was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After Missouri's sex offender registration statutes,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 589.400 et seq. (2000), became effective, appellant pleaded guilty to a sexual assault. After he completed his probation, he ceased registering as a sex offender and filed a petition for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the registration statutes. The Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) denied relief. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the registration statute did not apply to him because he received a suspended imposition of sentence, and the statute was an invalid ex post facto law because it constituted a new penalty for a crime he had committed before the registration requirements were enacted. Because the statutes operated retrospectively in the instant case, the issue was whether the registration requirements constituted a punishment. Using the five factors for assessing whether a statute constituted a punishment under the Ex Post Facto Clause, the appellate court held that the statutes did not constitute an invalid ex post facto law. Inter alia, the statutes were distinguishable from traditional notions of punishment. Although the statutes might have deterred future crimes, the mere presence of a deterrent effect did not establish that registration constituted a punishment because any number of governmental programs could deter crime without imposing punishment. While offenders who committed a sex offense against a minor had to update their registration more frequently, that was reasonably related to reducing recidivism and more efficiently investigating crimes against minors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that the workers' compensation act did not provide immunity for fellow employees, that he pleaded facts constituting the &quot;something extra&quot; required to remove the case from the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission, and that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.120 (2000) was unconstitutional. The appellate court noted that the dismissal of the employee's first case was on grounds that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, which was appealable. The issue of subject matter jurisdiction was fully litigated, and the judgment barred asserting the same kind of jurisdiction over the claim in any other circuit court. The employee's second lawsuit in a different county did not allege a new claim. The employee could not circumvent the dismissal in the first case by altering his pleadings with the benefit of the appellate opinion. The employee was not barred from pursuing his claim in the proper forum, which was the Labor and Industrial Commission.</SPAN></P>

The group, a collective group of independent cab drivers, appealed the trial court's judgment, arguing that the statutes violated various constitutional rights, that the legislature did not have the authority to enact such statutes, and that the statutes improperly allowed members of the profession to sit on the regional taxicab commission. The appellate court initially noted that the group failed to identify any suspect classifications or fundamental interests, and the statutes were conceivably rationally related to regulating part of the public transportation system and improving the quality of the system. The appellate court held that the group failed to identify any constitutional limitation applicable to the legislature's actions in enacting the statutes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a bus driver and was discharging students on a two-lane road. Defendant missed the proper stop for a student, where her driveway intersected with the road at the crest of a hill, and stopped and discharged her on the south side of the hill. After discharging the student, a sports utility vehicle crested the hill, swerved to avoid the bus, rolled over and caught fire. A pick-up truck then crested the hill and ran into the back of the bus. Defendant claimed that &sect; 304.050.4 was vague and therefore, unconstitutional. Defendant also claimed the evidence was insufficient to convict him. The appellate court affirmed the conviction. The appellate court held that in determining the validity of the statute the court had to look at the facts of the case; there was nothing ambiguous about how to apply the &quot;plainly visible&quot; language when the evidence confirmed there was no visibility to other drivers until they crested the hill obstructing their view. All of the measurements established that the bus had stopped short of being visible at a distance of 300 feet to other drivers once their view became unobstructed; thus, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) ordered appellant, the division of family services, to remove and expunge respondent individuals' names from the central registry. The division appealed the trial court's judgment finding that the statutory scheme mandated by Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 210 was unconstitutional on its face. Also, the division appealed the trial court's decision assessing litigation costs against it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals were subject to an investigation by the division. As a result of the administrative investigation, they were included in the division's central registry, which identified perpetrators of either child abuse or neglect or both. Upon judicial review of the administrative action, the trial court concluded there was no credible or believable evidence to support the allegations of abuse or neglect. Upon the basis of its conclusion, the trial court properly ordered the division to remove and expunge the individuals' names from the central registry. Additionally, because a new enactment superseded the statute on which the individuals relied to define their rights, the appeal no longer represented an actual controversy, and the case was moot. Furthermore, once the trial court ordered the division to remove and expunge the individuals' names from the central registry, they received complete relief. Therefore, the trial court improperly ruled on the constitutional validity of ch. 210. Because no statutory authority allowing the individuals to recover litigation costs against the division was found, the trial court improperly awarded the individuals' costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the order requiring the division to remove the names of the individuals' from its central registry of perpetrators of child abuse. The supreme court vacated the determination regarding the constitutionality of the statute. Finally, that portion of the judgment assessing costs against the division was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Each of the photos was independently relevant and assisted the jurors in some respect to show the scene of the crime, the victims' identities, the nature and extent of the wounds, the condition and location of the bodies, or his mental state at the time of the murders. There was enough evidence to establish that defendant deliberated on the murders of the victims because a photograph created the inference that he removed the butcher knife from the kitchen and took it to the bedroom where he used it to kill them. The 911 call established that the mother attempted to call for help yet her call was disconnected while she screamed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose from events surrounding the death of a two-year-old, who had been placed in foster care. While performing emergency medical treatment, the rescue personnel discovered a series of small, round, bruises running parallel along the child's spine. This information was relayed to defendant, a nurse employed at the hospital. The child later died of abusive head trauma. Defendant admitted that she did not document the bruises in her medical report or call the child abuse hotline even though she was aware of the legal obligation to report abuse. Defendant was charged with failure to report child abuse under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.115.1 (2000), and failure to report child abuse to a physician under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.120 (2000). In a plurality opinion, the appellate court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 210.115 and 210.120 were not unconstitutionally vague. The phrase &quot;reasonable cause to suspect&quot; was found readily understandable by ordinary persons, and these were words of common understanding that spoke for themselves and provided fair notice of the required conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, mortgagee, appealed from the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which entered summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, mortgagors, for violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 443.130 (2000). The mortgagee appealed in part based on the alleged unconstitutionality of &sect; 443.130; thus, the instant court had exclusive appellate jurisdiction. Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagee asserted that the mortgagors' letter did not place it on notice that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 443.130 was being invoked. The instant court agreed. First, the mortgagors demanded an &quot;immediate release&quot; of the deed of trust, rather than allowing for 15 business days in which the mortgagee could respond as allowed under the statute. In addition, the mortgagors demanded that the mortgagee record the deed of release, which was another action not required by the statute. Finally, reading the mortgagors' letter as a whole, nothing placed the mortgagee on notice that the mortgagors were making a demand under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 443.130, whether directly, by reprinting, citing, or referencing, or otherwise. As the August 8, 2002, letter did not sufficiently track the statutory requirements of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 443.130, the judgment was reversed, and the mortgagee's remaining two points on appeal and the mortgagors' cross-appeal were not addressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, male candidate, was prevented from filing for election as a St. Louis County township committeewoman.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As previously noted, the candidate sought a declaration that all laws in Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 115 that exclude men and women from filing for, running for, or holding elected office based on their gender were unconstitutional. Except as to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115.607, the candidate failed to preserve any constitutional claim as to Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 115. With respect to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115.607, the candidate's claim that the statute violated his constitutional rights required that the office of political party committeewoman be a public office. It was not. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115.607 incorporated the parties' &quot;equal gender rules.&quot; The distinction between &quot;political party office&quot; and &quot;public office&quot; was relied on to resolve voting rights claims made by party members over delegate selection and party committee qualifications. Political parties' rights to govern themselves were protected by the First Amendment guarantee of free association. Further, the state's interest in promoting the associational rights of political parties was sufficient to overcome an equal protection challenge to the statute. The state demonstrated an exceedingly persuasive justification for the equal gender rules.</SPAN></P>

The evidence showed that defendant went voluntarily to the sheriff's office to answer questions. The police were not required to have probable cause when they interrogated defendant, because he was not under arrest or arrest-like restraints. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to quash the information, as the prosecution filed a Notice of Intent to Seek the Death Penalty and a Notice of Evidence in Aggravation and Supplemental Disclosure pursuant to Mo.

The secretary of state informed the governor that he would take appropriate action to place the measure on the ballot as soon as he received the joint resolution. The attorney general then sought relief in the courts to compel the secretary of state to act. After receiving the joint resolution, the secretary of state promptly delivered a copy of the resolution to the state auditor for the purpose of preparing a fiscal note and fiscal note summary, and to place the issue on the ballot. The supreme court held that the secretary of state had a duty to take such actions as were necessary, in an expedited manner, to prepare the resolution for submission to the people of Missouri at the August 3, 2004 election in accordance with the governor's proclamation, and that if any further relief was required, Mo.

Although the circuit court also terminated the parental rights of the father, only the mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that using &sect; 211.447.2(1) as a ground for termination was unconstitutional because it arbitrarily and capriciously deprived her of her liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of her children without due process of law. The court held that no constitutional issue existed because &sect; 211.447.2(1) was not a ground, but merely a trigger for the filing of the petition. The mother also claimed that the Division of Family Services (DFS) failed to prove the pleaded statutory grounds for termination. The court affirmed, holding that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the mother abandoned the children under &sect; 211.447.4(1)(a). For example, the evidence showed that the mother, without good cause, failed to schedule visits with her children, although DFS repeatedly contacted her for that purpose. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the mother abused or neglected her children under &sect; 211.447.4(2). The evidence showed that the mother failed to provide adequate shelter, personal cleanliness, and even basic education for the children despite DFS arrangements for the mother to participate in programs to address these issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the State and the Missouri Attorney General, sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which found in favor of plaintiff individuals and held that the Concealed-Carry Act (Act), Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 50.535, 571.030, and 571.094, was unconstitutional. The individuals cross-appealed the denial of their Hancock claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal came from a judgment of the circuit court declaring the recently enacted Act unconstitutional. The circuit court held that the Act violated Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, but specifically rejected the individuals' Hancock claim and all other claims, Mo. Const. art. X, &sect;&sect; 16 and 21. All parties appealed, and the court held that the Act was not unconstitutional under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. There was no constitutional prohibition against the wearing of concealed weapons; there was only a prohibition against invoking the right to keep and bear arms to justify the wearing of concealed weapons. Further, the court reversed the judgment dismissing the Hancock claims as it applied to five counties, but only to the extent that it constituted an unfunded mandate imposed on those counties. The judgment of the trial court dismissing the Hancock claims as applied to all other counties was affirmed because of lack of ripeness, and the trial court's injunction prohibiting enforcement of the Act in those counties was therefore dissolved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment finding that the Act was unconstitutional. The judgment dismissing the Hancock claims was reversed as it applied to five counties, and judgment was entered enjoining the State form enforcing the Act only to the extent that it constituted an unfunded mandate imposed on those counties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Audrain County (Missouri) terminated appellant mother's parental rights, based in part on Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.447.2(1) (2000) and based in part on evidence of neglect and other grounds under various provisions of &sect; 211.447.4. The mother appealed directly to the court invoking the court's exclusive jurisdiction where the constitutionality of a state statute was challenged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother asserted that &sect; 211.447.2(1), which required the filing of a petition for termination of parental rights when a child had been in foster care for at least 15 of the previous 22 months, was unconstitutional as it had been interpreted by Missouri courts. The main point of her argument was that the statute should not be construed so that 15 months in foster care was also grounds for termination of parental rights. The court stated that Missouri cases that had interpreted &sect; 211.447.2(1) to make 15 months in foster care custody a ground for termination should not be followed. However, the court held that a reading of &sect; 211.447 in its entirety showed that there was no constitutional issue. By considering the history and the circumstances of the enactment of &sect; 211.447.2, it was clear that the legislature did not intend &sect; 211.447.2(1) as a ground for termination, but rather solely as a trigger for filing a termination petition. Because the mother's parental rights were terminated on four statutory grounds in addition to &sect; 211.447.2(1), the court transferred the case to the lower appellate court to consider the mother's challenge to the sufficiency of those determinations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court resolved the issue by which the mother invoked the court's jurisdiction and transferred her appeal to the lower appellate court for resolution of the mother's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence for terminating her parental rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to confine the individual as a SVP. The circuit court found probable cause to believe that the individual might be a SVP, and, following a jury trial, he was committed to the DMH for control, care, and treatment as a SVP. The individual appealed, claiming due process and equal protection claims, but the court affirmed. He first asserted that he was denied equal protection, because being denied counsel during his end of confinement interview created differential treatment compared to other persons rendered dangerous by a mental disorder who were immediately entitled to counsel under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 632.300 to 632.325 (2000), but the court disagreed. The statutory scheme provided counsel in the same time frame as that of the SVP. Further, the court found that the statutory scheme was narrowly tailored to promote the compelling interest of protecting the public from that small percentage of offenders, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 632.495 and 632.498 (2000). The court concluded that there was no equal protection violation in association with the timing of the evaluation provided by the psychiatrist or psychologist pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.489 (2000).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a disabled student and a non-profit, public interest law center, challenged the constitutionality of a senate bill enacted, signed into law, and codified as Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 162.670, .675, .961, .962 (2002). The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, granted summary judgment in favor of respondents, the board of education and the department of elementary and secondary education. The student and the center sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the student and the center contended the laws in question, which pertained to the education of students with disabilities, were enacted in violation of the &quot;original purpose&quot; and &quot;clear title&quot; provisions of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 21, 23. The supreme court disagreed, finding that in the general sense, the original purpose was to address the educational placement of special education students, which was the very thing at issue in the bill's purpose: to reduce the scope of judicial review of decisions from administrative hearing panels concerning special education students. For these reasons, the later amendments to the bill addressing state policy for the educational placement of special education students were wholly consistent with the original purpose of the bill. Further the bill's title was not underinclusive as it referenced everything included in the bill; all four statutes affected pertained to the placement of students with disabilities. As such, the supreme court determined that the student and the center failed to carry their burden to demonstrate that the bill was unconstitutionally enacted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers sued for tax refunds, contending that a 1998 constitutional amendment dealing with school district tax rates was subject to the Hancock Amendment, Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 22(a), under which a district's maximum authorized levy was calculated. The Circuit Court of Morgan County (Missouri) dismissed the taxpayers' petition. They appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers' suit for tax refunds was based on their contention that the Hancock amendment (Hancock), in Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 22(a), obligated the school district to roll back its levy to less than $ 2.75 because the growth in the valuation of property in the district outpaced the general rate of inflation - an event that, the taxpayers argued, triggered a rollback under &sect; 22(a). The issue before the appellate court was whether Constitutional Amendment No. 2 (1998), which amended art. X, &sect; 11(b), authorized a school district to set a property tax levy of $ 2.75 without voter approval regardless of Hancock. The appellate court held that art. X, &sect; 11(b), as amended in 1998, authorized the school district to set its property tax levy rate at $ 2.75 or less, regardless of the calculation required by art. X, &sect; 22(a) of Hancock. Article X, &sect; 11(b) authorized school districts to maintain or set levies at the $ 2.75 rate by decision of the school board. Voters relinquished the right to vote on school district levy increases up to and including the rate of $ 2.75 when they amended art. X, &sect; 11(b) in 1998.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of assault in the second degree and was sentenced as a prior offender pursuant to Missouri's recidivism statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.016 (2000), because he had previously pleaded guilty to assault in a military court-martial. After the Court of Appeals, Western District (Missouri), affirmed the judgment from the Circuit Court of Carroll County (Missouri), the court granted a transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the holding in his case conflicted with a holding from the Court of Appeals, Eastern District that precluded using convictions from military courts to enhance a sentence under the recidivism statute. The court granted transfer to address the conflict. The court stated that under the plain language of &sect; 558.016.2, convictions could be considered felonies if they were either labeled as felonies or if persons convicted of them could be sentenced to death or imprisonment for a term in excess of one year. Military offenses were not classified as felonies or misdemeanors. Consequently, whether military court-martial convictions qualified as felonies depended on the sentence that could be imposed. The court held that because defendant was sentenced to confinement for 18 months, his court-martial conviction qualified as a felony conviction and was properly considered in sentencing him as a prior offender. Additionally, defendant's reliance on the other case was misplaced because his court-martial conviction was the result of a guilty plea he entered while he was represented by counsel and none of the potential due process issues raised in the other case were present.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the prosecutor did not make improper comments in his voir dire and his guilt phase closing argument.

VIII, as the due process guarantee did not apply to civil actions. The court also rejected the claim that the statute was unconstitutionally vague in violation of U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV. Lastly, the court addressed the amount of the penalty awarded. There were nine separate transmissions, each of which had a cover page and an accompanying form second page. The court held that such constituted only nine violations and, therefore, reduced the award to $ 4,500.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the court, which affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences and denied post-conviction relief. Defendant was convicted in Missouri of first-degree murder, and a judge determined that the death sentence should be imposed after the jury could not unanimously agree to a punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of first-degree murder, but could not agree on punishment during the penalty phase, voting 11 to 1 in favor of life imprisonment. The judge then undertook the 4-step process required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.030.4 (1994) for determining punishment and decided to impose a death sentence. The supreme court affirmed and denied post-conviction relief. Defendant contended that his constitutional rights were violated, as the judge rather than the jury made the factual determinations on which his eligibility for the death sentence was predicated. The supreme court agreed, recalled its mandate, and stated that, under &sect; 565.030, the only possible sentence was life imprisonment. The death sentenced imposed on defendant was not based on a jury finding of any fact, but rather was entirely based on the judge's findings. That process clearly violated the United States Supreme Court's requirement that the jury rather than the judge determine the facts on which the death penalty was based. The supreme court further held that the State was unable to meet its burden of showing that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court recalled its mandate, invalidated defendant's sentence of death, and resentenced him to life imprisonment without eligibility for probation, parole, or release, except by act of the governor.</SPAN></P>

The board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board argued that the case was moot, by maintaining the date by which Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 162.666.10 stated the school district &quot;shall&quot; certify the Students' Bill of Rights for vote approval, that the word &quot;shall&quot; demonstrated the legislature's mandate the Bill of Rights be certified, if ever, no later than March 15, 1999. The appellate court concluded that the selection of March 15, 1999, as the deadline for certification of the Students' Bill of Rights was not random. That was the date by which the general assembly intended the outcome of all of the matters addressed by Senate Bill 781 to be known. The word &quot;shall&quot; was intended to be mandatory. To comport with the statute, it was necessary that the Students' Bill of Rights be certified and placed on a ballot no later than March 15, 1999. Because the district declined to certify the Bill of Rights by that deadline, and because respondent citizen failed to compel it to do so, any judgment by a court with respect to the Students' Bill of Rights would have no practical effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the Wildwood, Mo., Ordinance &sect; 1005.080 exceeded the authority in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.410 (2000). The city argued that the statute gave it authority to required developers to post bonds in an amount that exceeded the estimated construction costs of improvements. The city also argued that the section did not preclude it from requiring developers to post a separate maintenance bond. The appellate court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.410 did not prevent the city from collecting subdivision bonds in an amount exceeding the estimated actual cost of construction. The statute provided the means by which a city could protect itself in the event it had to complete the subdivision improvements. The statute enabled the city to use a reasonable estimate so that the actual construction was provided for and secured in the event the actual construction costs were higher than the original estimate. The statute did not effect subdivision-related maintenance deposits collected by cities. Because the challenged ordinance was valid under both the original and amended versions of &sect; 89.410, there was no need to reach its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as the challenged provisions of the city ordinance were valid, and there was no conflict between the statute and the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A client was incarcerated in the Missouri prison system. The attorney helped the client win a judgment against a board of police commissioners. After the client was awarded a substantial amount of money, the State sought to recover under MIRA. The attorney argued that the State was unable to recover the amount owed under a contingency-fee agreement. After a judgment was entered in favor of the State, the attorney sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the State was permitted to seek reimbursement for the cost of incarceration under MIRA out of assets belonging to an inmate. Although the State's award had priority over liens under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.837.4 (2000), the court held that the resolution of the case turned on the definition of the word &quot;asset&quot; in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.827 (2000). Under &sect; 217.827, an asset was defined as property belonging to or due an offender. The existence of the judgment in favor of the client hinged on the fees and expenses incurred by the attorney. Therefore, the amount due to the client was the sum of the judgment, minus the attorney fees and expenses. As such, the State was only entitled to the amount remaining.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant revenue director challenged a decision from the Administrative Hearing Commission (Missouri), which determined that respondent taxpayer's cafeteria sales were not taxable under Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer owned and operated a cafeteria-style dining facility inside of its office buildings for the convenience of its employees. The cafeteria only served meals and drinks to employees and authorized visitors. The taxpayer did not pay sales tax on its purchases of food, drink, and other restaurant supplies. After paying sales tax on the meals and drinks, the taxpayer sought a refund. After the hearing commission ordered a refund, the director sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the sales were not taxable under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.020.1(6) (2000). There was a special relationship between the taxpayer and those to whom it served meals and drinks. The fact that the taxpayer served authorized guests on occasion did not invoke the taxing provisions of &sect; 144.020.1(6). Further, the evidence showed that the taxpayer did not invite the trade of the public. The services were not provided as a commercial enterprise. In addition, the court determined that the refund due was not offset by unpaid taxes due from the taxpayer. The three-year statute of limitations in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.220 passed when the taxpayer entered into a stipulation concerning an offset.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In support of his petition for habeas corpus, the prisoner argued that he was actually innocent of the inmate's murder. The prisoner's case presented a case of first impression on the issue of whether, and upon what showing, the prisoner, making a freestanding claim of actual innocence, was entitled to habeas corpus relief from his conviction and sentence. The supreme court found that, because the continued imprisonment and eventual execution of an innocent person was a manifest injustice, the prisoner could obtain relief from a judgment of conviction and sentence of death upon a clear and convincing showing of actual innocence that undermined confidence in the correctness of the judgment. In light of the resulting lack of any remaining direct evidence of the prisoner's guilt from the first trial, the court held that the prisoner already met the clear and convincing evidence standard, as confidence in the outcome of the first trial was sufficiently undermined by the recantation of all the key witnesses against the prisoner in the first trial to require setting aside the conviction and sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PSC filed proposed rules establishing asymmetrical pricing standards that prohibited certain transactions between public utilities and their affiliates.

The utilities contended that the PSC's promulgation of the rules failed to comply with the procedures set forth in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 386.250(6) (2000), but the court held that, in view of the evidentiary procedures provided at the three-day hearing, the PSC fully complied with the requirements. The utilities also contended that the PSC failed to comply with the publication requirements of Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 536, but the court stated that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.021.2(1) (2000) imposed no such obligation on an agency. The PSC was not engaged in an adjudication, but in rulemaking. Thus, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 393.140(5) (2000) was therefore irrelevant to the court's review of the rules. The court concluded that the PSC had authority to promulgate the rules and that the promulgation satisfied all relevant rulemaking procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner pleaded guilty to manufacturing a controlled substance and possessing a controlled substance. He was sentenced to a treatment program pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.362.2 (2000). He received conduct violations resulting in his discharge from a treatment program and his term of incarceration was no longer suspended. On appeal, the prisoner argued he was entitled to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.07(d) rather than by seeking habeas corpus relief, and that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.362 (2000) was invalid because it was unconstitutionally vague and in violation of the principle of separation of powers. The appellate court initially noted the prisoner abandoned his first argument on appeal. The appellate court held as to the constitutional claim, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.362 (2000) unambiguously provided that the sentence would be executed if the defendant failed to complete a treatment program, and only the judiciary, through the trial court, was involved in imposing a sentence having that consequence.</SPAN></P>

Before the Department answered all the pleadings, the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) granted a permanent injunction and found that various provisions of AMHTD were unconstitutional. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord of a mobile home park applied to the Department to have a mobile home declared abandoned and have the title transferred to the landlord under the abandoned manufactured home title disposition (AMHTD), Mo.

The Missouri Supreme Court found that: (1) the trial court erred in reaching constitutional issues before it allowed the Department to file an answer or show cause why an injunction should not issue as to the implementation of AMHTD as to homeowners and without permitting the department to put on evidence or conduct discovery on those issues, (2) it was premature to determine the validity of the provisions of AMHTD relating to secured parties because the provisions regarding homeowners were so inseparably connected to the provisions regarding secured parties that it could not have been presumed that the legislature would have adopted them in the absence of the provisions regarding homeowners, and (3) the trial court had not determined whether the creditor had standing to seek relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents sought visitation with the children after being denied visitation for some time. The trial court ordered minimal visitation, which the parents challenged. The court found no error. The trial court had jurisdiction to enter its judgment under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.402.1(3) (2000), which permitted a court to grant visitation when a grandparent was unreasonably denied visitation for a period exceeding 90 days. The trial court's finding that the visitation denial was unreasonable was supported by testimony that the grandparents were not allowed visits or telephone contact with the children for two years before the entry of the visitation order. The court noted that &sect; 452.402.1(3) required only that the 90-day period elapsed before a visitation order was entered, and to the extent that In re G.P.C., 28 S.W.3d 357 (Mo.

The appellate court initially noted Missouri child support enforcement scheme did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of judicial power, as the limitation of the authority of the administrative agency, together with the right of judicial review, saved the statute from a separation of powers argument. The appellate court held only a court could enforce administrative orders so that they had the effect of a judgment. The appellate court concluded Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 454.490 (2000), allowing an administrative agency to enter child support orders, did not place exclusively judicial powers in the hands of the executive branch or delegate a judicial power, but merely allowed a court to enforce the administrative decision.</SPAN></P>

The Missouri Supreme Court found that the treasurer did not have standing to bring suit against the judges to enforce delivery of the funds to the unclaimed property fund, as: (1) Mo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 15 (1986) explicitly limited the treasurer's authority to the receipt, investment, custody, and disbursement of state funds and funds received from the United States government, and did not permit the treasurer to collect or enforce delivery of funds; and (2) to the extent that Mo.

The trial court determined that the treasurer had no standing to seek the funds under the UDUPA. In affirming, the court determined that, because the treasurer was not aggrieved by the trial court's judgment, she had no standing to bring the appeal. The court had the duty to determine the issue of standing before reaching the merits of the case. The court noted that the treasurer lacked constitutional authority to enforce delivery of the funds under Mo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 15. To the extent that Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state attorney general filed a quo warranto action, asking the Circuit Court of Osage County, Missouri, to &quot;oust&quot; respondent Cole County circuit judges from continuing to exercise supervisory authority over receivership funds held in the registry of their courts and to instead pay the money in those funds over to the state treasurer. The suit was dismissed, and the attorney general appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the attorney general contended that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 531.010 (2000) authorized the filing of this quo warranto action. The supreme court determined that the attorney general's allegations that the judges were required by statute to report and turn the funds over to the treasurer after five years was not an appropriate subject for an action in quo warranto; quo warranto was only available to deal with usurpation of power not possessed. Prohibition or mandamus was the appropriate remedy here, as the basis of the allegations was that the judges improperly used powers granted to them. Nonetheless, even if an extraordinary writ was available, it could not be sought in a circuit court of concurrent jurisdiction. Insofar as the final sentence of &sect; 531.010 purported to give the trial court authority to issue a quo warranto against the judges, who presided in an adjoining county, the supreme court held it was in conflict with Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 4(1) and was void as an unconstitutional delegation to adjoining circuit courts of powers reserved to the supreme court and the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

The circumstances involved a 61-year-old man soliciting or requesting sexual conduct from a 13-year-old girl. The requested act, were it to occur, would have constituted the crime of first-degree sodomy. That solicitation or request was not just speech, but conduct that defendant, under the law, was presumed to know was likely to cause affront or alarm. As construed, the challenged section did not violate the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech. The trial established that the 13-year-old victim did in fact experience &quot;affront or alarm.&quot; Defendant was presumed to know that certain behavior was criminal. Specifically, that having oral sex with a person less than 14 years old was a felony-first-degree statutory sodomy. Defendant asked a 13-year-old girl to participate in the crime of statutory sodomy. Regardless of how the conduct was characterized, defendant was deemed under the law to know that such conduct was likely to cause affront and alarm.</SPAN></P>

Respondent incumbent sued, contesting appellant challenger's right to be on the ballot on the basis that the challenger did not meet the one-year residency requirement under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 478.320.6 (2000). The Circuit Court of Scotland County, Missouri, entered judgment for the incumbent, and the challenger appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal the challenger asserted that he met the statutory residency requirement because he had lived in the county in question the year prior to his going to college. The incumbent contended that the relevant period was the one year immediately prior to the election. Under the statute an associate circuit judge was required to have resided in the county for which he sought to be elected &quot;at least one year prior to the date&quot; of his election. The court construed the word &quot;prior&quot; as used in &sect; 478.320.6 to include the concept of immediacy, whether stated expressly or not. Thus the one year immediately prior to the election, and not an earlier year of residency, was the relevant period or residency under the statute. The challenger also asserted that, on the court's reading, the statute denied equal protection as between recent residents and those appointed by the governor to office, and infringed upon the rights of voters to participate in an election. The court turned aside both challenges, finding that the statute served a rational purpose and that the challenge based upon the voters' rights had previously been rejected under still valid case law precedent.</SPAN></P>

The owner argued that the section violated the Eighth Amendment of the federal Constitution and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, and the takings clauses of both constitutions. The state contended that the issues were not timely raised in the trial court. The appellate court found that each appellant asserted that the claim for punitive damages violated the federal and state constitutions in numerous respects. The specific claims raised on appeal were raised in the motion for new trial. Under &sect; 537.675, the state had no prosecutorial power and could not intervene. The state had no interest in the amount awarded as punitive damages until that amount was reduced to a final judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents argued that the trial court erred by granting the grandparents visitation rights because the grandparent visitation statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.402, was unconstitutional. The supreme court disagreed. The trial court did not err in ordering limited visitation. The parents had prevented the grandparents from visiting and otherwise associating with the grandchildren for over one year. The trial court specifically found that that constituted an unreasonable denial of visitation for over 90 days, and, further, that it was in the best interest of the minor children that the grandparents were awarded reasonable visitation of their minor grandchildren. The trial court crafted a visitation order that was very narrowly drawn to accomplish only a minimal intrusion on the parental rights of the parents, and which comported with the occasional, temporary visitation that came within the constitutional safe guards of the Due Process Clause. While the parents suggested that the trial judge should have made more detailed as to the reasons for its decision, the statute did not require that and the parents did not timely request such findings. Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator, a Missouri nonprofit corporation, maintained its registered agent and its principal place of business in St. Louis County. Relator moved to transfer venue, arguing that under the special nonprofit corporate venue statute venue in St. Louis City was improper. Respondent overruled relator's motion, reasoning by analogy that although Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 355.176.4 said that suits against nonprofit corporations shall be commenced only in certain venues, that limitation should not apply when a nonprofit corporation was sued together with an individual. In that case, as with for-profit corporations, venue would be governed by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 508.010(2). Thus, the issue for review was whether Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 355.176.4, or the general venue statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 508.010(2), governed venue when a nonprofit corporate defendant was joined with an individual or corporate for-profit defendant. The supreme court construed Mo. Rev.

The supreme court found that the trial court correctly dismissed the request for relief directly against the employer. Under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 213.111.1 (1994), a civil suit against the alleged discriminator had to be filed within two years of the discrimination or its discovery. Although none of the MHRA's governing provisions provided for review of the &quot;no probable cause&quot; decision, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 213.075.3 (1994) required the director and MCHR to follow set procedures in making the determination. Failure to follow proper procedures in the exercise of discretion was reviewable by mandamus under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150 (1994). The director was the person who had the duty to make the probable cause determination. On remand, the worker needed to set out the specific procedures not followed.</SPAN></P>

The wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife argued that her husband's death from suicide was the result of depression caused by his work injuries. The appellate court found that the claim for death benefits was barred by the 300-week requirement found in the definition of the term &quot;death&quot; in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.020.4 (2000). The statute was not a statute of limitations and did not create any right to collect death benefits under workers' compensation unless the death occurred within 300 weeks of the accident or the death was the result of an occupational disease. If no cause existed under the statute, the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.430 (2000) were not triggered and did not apply. The employee's job did not expose him to a risk of depression that was greater than that of the public generally. The 300-week requirement did not violate equal protection. Where death occurred at or near the time of an accident, the connection between the accident and the death was readily identifiable and evidence could be introduced to establish causation. As time passed, the connection could become unclear, as other factors could intervene and contribute to an employee's death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As originally introduced S.B. 894, 90th Gen. Assem., 1st Reg. Sess. (Mo. 2000) consisted of 15 pages, and its purpose was to repeal various Missouri Code Sections relating to property ownership and to enact in lieu thereof 13 new sections. However, before it was enacted into law, the bill grew to 90 pages and grew from 13 amendments to a single chapter of Missouri's statutes into 70 amendments to 15 chapters of Missouri's statutes. The association argued that the title to the bill violated the &quot;clear title&quot; provision of Mo. Const. art. III &sect; 23, in that the title &quot;relating to property ownership,&quot; as used in the bill, was fatally vague and could relate to every kind of property. The appellate court agreed, concluding the bill's title was so amorphous as to violate the clear title provisions. The title gave the reader no guidance as to the contents of the act. The phrase &quot;relating to property ownership&quot; was not a clear title for the legislation, as it could be held to describe the contents of the bill only by interpreting the phrase &quot;relating to property ownership&quot; so broadly that it obscured the contents of the act rendering the &quot;clear title&quot; mandate meaningless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Venue was changed to the Circuit Court of Cape Girardeau County (Missouri). Defendant was found competent to proceed and was convicted of two counts of first degree murder. As to the first murder, the Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.032.2(2), (3), (7) (2000), aggravators were found and he was sentenced to death. For the second murder he was sentenced to life without parole. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant assaulted his girlfriend and threatened to kill her, everyone who lived with her, their baby, and himself if she told. She told him that she told her parents. That day he got a gun, went to her house, and killed her parents. He used his baby as a human shield before surrendering. The supreme court found that defendant showed no prejudice by the venirepersons-selection process. The percentage of African-Americans among venirepersons was greater than the percentage in the county population; thus there was a fair cross-section. The trial judge properly dismissed venirepersons who gave contradictory responses about whether they could vote for the death penalty. The public defender's expert's billing statements were properly discoverable and admissible to show the expert's potential bias. Testimony by two officers that defendant, at the station after the crime, was solemn and quiet was not used as affirmative evidence of guilt. The prosecutor's written comment in his copy of a defense expert report which mentioned defendant's distrust of white people, that he &quot;liked white girls though,&quot; was not exceptionally clear proof that the death penalty was sought because of race.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved to dismiss the charge of abandonment of a corpse. The Circuit Court of Cape Girardeau County (Missouri) granted defendant's motion, declaring Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 194.425 (2000) unconstitutional and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant left his apartment at about 6:40 a.m., leaving behind the body of his deceased wife and his daughter age three. When defendant left the apartment, he went to his place of work. He returned about three to four hours later. Defendant argued Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 194.425 (2000), abandonment of a corpse, was void for vagueness. The court ruled that the statute provided fair notice of the conduct that was deemed to be a crime. The statute did not violate the due process clause and was not void for vagueness. The fact that defendant returned to the apartment some three to four hours later could negate the conclusion that he intended to abandon the body of his wife. The question of whether he was guilty of abandonment of a corpse was a factual question.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found the jury could infer defendant's deliberation from his continued assault on a non-resisting victim. The prosecutor's reference to defendant's criminal record, and misstatement that defendant was &quot;a convicted killer,&quot; were not plain error.  Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.030, describing trial procedure, did not create a separate first-degree murder category, and an indictment's lack of a statutory aggravator did not preclude the death penalty. The jury instruction defining &quot;depravity of mind&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. The prosecutor's strike of an African-American juror was not improper, and a police officer was not excusable for cause. Introduction, in the penalty phase, of defendant's prior convictions and child support record was proper. The trial court's grant of the State's motion in limine to preclude inquiry about willingness to visit defendant in prison was not error, nor was the issue preserved.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospitals contended that the amendment to the hospital lien law threatened to reduce the amounts that might otherwise be available to the hospitals to cover unpaid fees. The State argued that there was a relationship between professional licensing and the hospital lien law. The appellate court held that because the new Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 430.225(2000) did not fairly relate to, or have a natural connection with, professional licensing, the addition of &sect; 430.225 to H.B. 343 (Mo. 1999) created within the bill a second subject in violation of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 23. Since Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's murder conviction in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (Missouri), after which he was sentenced to death, was affirmed, and defendant's motion for post-conviction relief under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15 was denied by the trial court. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant murdered and robbed a couple. At the penalty phase, counsel's tendered non-statutory mitigation instructions were replaced by standard instructions. The last two paragraphs of those instructions were inadvertently omitted, and counsel did not object to the incomplete instructions. The supreme court held that the fact it previously found on direct appeal that this mistake was not plain error did not foreclose it being an error which so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial could not be relied on as having produced a just result. In this case, submitting faulty instructions on the critical mitigation issue was a sufficiently egregious error to deprive defendant of the effective assistance of counsel. Given the jurors' focus on mitigation, and their confusion about it when considering the death penalty, counsel's error resulted in the kind of prejudice requiring a new penalty phase trial due to counsel's ineffective assistance. Defendant's prior representation by a current assistant prosecutor did not require a new trial, and the 90-day time limit in the post-conviction relief Rule, Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15, was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed to the extent it denied defendant a new penalty phase trial. Otherwise, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the pre-deprivation statute of Mo. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 143.431.1(3), would have subjected them to the risk of a penalty. The dual filing option was neither a clear nor certain remedy. The subsidiary could not seek declaratory and injunctive relief because they were constitutionally inadequate because they taxpayer was not afforded a remedy to recover its payment of unlawful taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city denied the owners' zoning petition that would allow development of the owners' property for residences in accordance with a reclassification. After the owners won a judgment against the city in a lawsuit, the city then rezoned the property in accordance with the owners' request. The owners then filed another suit seeking damages for the city's failure to rezone the property initially. The claim for damages was that the initial refusal of rezoning constituted a temporary taking and inverse condemnation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 26, 28.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The felon challenged, inter alia, the validity of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.015.1. He contended that this parole eligibility statute was unconstitutionally vague because it was susceptible to different constructions as a result of the lack of the word &quot;minimum.&quot; The supreme court held that the fact that the trial court interpreted the statute contrary to the felon's view of how it should be interpreted did not make the statute unconstitutionally vague. The statute prescribed a punishment that could not be diminished by parole, probation, conditional release or suspended imposition or execution of sentence. Thus, the felon's argument that the parole eligibility restrictions contained in the statute did not relate to the punishment for the armed criminal conviction was overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This issue arose from the divorce of the mother and father and the appointment of the guardian over the children. The trial court held that Mo. Rev.

The mother alleged that the appellate court did not have jurisdiction because the circuit court's order did not dispose of all the claims in her petition for judicial review and for injunctive relief. The circuit court's failure to grant or deny the mother's claim for a permanent injunction was not a final judgment and therefore, not appealable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted relief to the driver after a hearing in which neither side produced evidence. The director, however, met her burden by introducing the administrative record showing the convictions. The driver had the burden of producing evidence that he was qualified for a driver's license, and the director had the burden of producing evidence that he was not. The burden of persuasion, as distinct from the burden of producing evidence, was at all times on the driver and never shifted. It was the driver's burden to prove that the facts on which the director relied in denying the license were not true or were legally insufficient to support the denial or suspension of the license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of one count of felony driving while intoxicated (DWI) and other charges after he was stopped and arrested in the town of Lakeview, Missouri. The arresting officer was a Lake Ozark, Missouri, police officer. The supreme court granted transfer under Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 10 following an opinion by the Circuit Court of Miller County, Missouri.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sole point on appeal was that the state presented no evidence that the arresting officer had authority to arrest within the town of Lakeview, and that the trial court therefore should not have allowed the officer to testify about his observations and arrest of defendant. Defendant cited the best evidence rule in his point. The supreme court noted that the best evidence rule applied only when the terms of a writing itself were disputed, not when a witness with personal knowledge testified about facts that also happened to be in a writing. The court also noted that defendant's trial objections and point were both premised on a motion to suppress evidence. The court held that: 1) the trial court in no way treated the objections made at trial as a motion to suppress, 2) in overruling the objections the trial court was not exercising its discretion to permit an untimely motion to suppress, and 3) defendant could not have been surprised that the officer would testify about where the arrest occurred and his observations thereof. The supreme court therefore concluded the point asserted on appeal was not preserved. The record also failed to establish any plain error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the supreme court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a continuance when it found that the defendant's principal attorney was capable and experienced, or did it abuse its discretion in refusing to admit irrelevant testimony that the victim died as a result of improper medical care. The trial court's error in finding sufficient foundation to admit a knife as the murder weapon was harmless error. Because defendant did not specifically request lesser-included-offense instructions, the trial court did not plainly err in not giving such instructions. Because defendant took more then a few steps to reach the victim, reasonable jurors could infer deliberation from all the circumstances. During the penalty phase, the trial court acted within its discretion and there was no prejudice. The death penalty was not disproportionate where defendant stabbed the victim after tailing him for blocks, presented no credible evidence of self-defense, showed no remorse for a racist murder, and where the evidence was compelling that defendant murdered the victim with deliberation.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat.  &sect; 162.601, enacted in the 1997-98 Missouri legislative session. The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, held subsections six and seven of &sect; 162.601 to be unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were composed of members of board of education (Board), three of which were seeking candidacy for an upcoming school board election. The Board sought declaratory relief alleging that vagueness in the language of Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 162.601 rendered the Board incapable of determining which subdistricts were to hold elections. Since &sect; 162.601 also required the Board members to reside in the subdistrict of their representation, the Board claimed that without knowing which subdistricts were electing members, it would be impossible to determine qualified candidates. The State contended the Board had the statutory authority to fill in these missing details. The court disagreed, finding that the circuit court properly found subsections six and seven of &sect; 162.601 to be unconstitutionally void for vagueness and properly applied the severance doctrine finding them not to be essential and inseparable from the remaining subsections. The delegation of authority to &quot;establish&quot; the subdistricts in &sect; 162.601(6) followed by the creation of the ward composition of those same subdistricts in &sect; 162.601(7) presented a contradiction that was not reconcilable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a fire protection district and others, asked voters to approve a 10 cent increase of per $ 100 of assessed valuation. The measure passed by 13 votes, but certain voters filed an election contest. While the contest was pending, appellants levied the tax increase. The trial court entered an order setting aside the election. It ordered a new election, and the voters failed to approve the tax increase. Thereafter, respondent filed suit to recover the excess payments. The trial court held in respondent's favor and awarded it attorney fees. Appellants challenged the judgment, arguing the trial court erred by finding they collected the tax increase in violation of Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 22(a), and awarding respondent attorney fees. The court held Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 115.595.2 (2000) allowed a political subdivision to act upon the results of an election before an election contest was decided. However, the court noted a political subdivision was not entitled to keep the collected funds after a court found the tax increase unconstitutional. The court reversed in part, holding the award of attorney fees was unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed in part, because while appellants had the right to treat the increase as having been approved while the election contest was pending, it did so at the risk of being unable to retain the funds after voters' approval was set aside. However, the trial court erred by awarding respondent attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was charged with felony trespass and an enhanced punishment was added under Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 557.035.2 (Supp. 1999), a hate crimes statute which provided enhanced penalties for specified crimes when certain motivational factors were proven. Respondent filed a motion to dismiss the enhanced penalty, arguing the &quot;State believes&quot; requirement was vague because no person was on notice as to what the State believed, and no person could ever have a fair warning as to what the State believed regarding the motive element of a crime. The trial court sustained the motion, holding the statute was unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court noted the presence of motivating factors, rather than the State's belief in the presence of those factors, was the element of the crime that was subject to the vagueness rule. The court held the &quot;State's belief&quot; provision was not an element of the crime. The court reversed, holding the State's belief as to respondent's motives was simply a procedural prerequisite to the filing of the charge and a mechanism designed to ensure the prosecutor's good faith in bringing the charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed, because what the State believed, as provided in the hate crimes statute, was not an element of the crime; therefore, the trial court erred by concluding a person reading the statute was left to speculate as to what the State might believe with regard to some person's conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Montgomery County (Missouri) found appellant was operating a public and common nuisance, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 311.740 (2000) by serving alcohol without a city liquor license, selling alcohol to intoxicated persons, and allowing certain acts of lewdness. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's application for a city liquor license was denied. Investigators saw appellant's employees exposing themselves in violation of liquor regulations, and appellant served alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons. Appellant alleged Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 311.740.1 (2000) was vague by referring to implements once used to manufacture liquor. That part of the statute did not apply to appellant, and the reference to places where liquor was sold did apply and was not vague. Appellant had no standing to challenge Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 311.750.1 (2000), allowing pre-hearing closure of alcohol retailers, as it was not applied to appellant. The city's authority, under Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 311.220.2 (2000), to license liquor retailers was not preempted by the state's authority, under Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 311.095.1 (2000) to issue a resort liquor license. The evidence sufficiently established appellant's employees' lewd behavior, in violation of Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 70-2.130(14)(B) and (D), and appellant's service of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 311.310 (2000), and without a local license, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 311.220 (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed because the applicable statute was not unconstitutionally vague, appellant had no standing to challenge a pre-hearing closure statute, the city's authority to license alcohol retailers had not been preempted, and the evidence sufficiently established more than one violation by appellee of applicable regulations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Texas County (Missouri) quashing two subpoenas requesting information concerning a criminal investigation of a member of respondents' congregation, holding the subpoenas violated their right to free exercise of religion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State was investigating allegations a member of a religious congregation sexually abused his stepdaughters. The State believed the suspect had admitted the crime to the church elders and issued subpoenas duces tecum to respondents, church elders, to produce any and all relevant materials, including personal knowledge, regarding the alleged crime. Respondents moved to quash the subpoenas, arguing they required them to disclose a privileged communication made to them in their capacity as ministers providing spiritual counseling, and compelled them to disclose information that violated their right to free exercise of religion. The trial court quashed the subpoenas and the State appealed. The court initially determined the State had a right to pursue an interlocutory appeal because the order had the substantive effect of suppressing evidence. The court then held Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 56.085 (2000) did not specifically authorize a general investigative subpoena of personal knowledge. The court affirmed, holding the State's subpoena ordering respondents to bring personal knowledge pertaining to the criminal investigation was outside the scope of an investigative subpoena duces tecum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed, because the State's subpoena ordering respondents to bring personal knowledge pertaining to the criminal investigation was outside the scope of an investigative subpoena duces tecum.

Laws 301-13 (bill) was enacted to require health insurers to cover, for a minimal copayment, cancer screenings. In their lawsuit, appellants alleged that the bill was unconstitutional. On appeal of the trial court's judgment, the instant court affirmed. The fact that the bill was amended during its passage through legislature to require health insurers and providers to give information on the advantages, disadvantages, and risks, including cancer, of breast implantation did not unlawfully change its original purpose. The bill's original purpose logically related to mandating pre-operation information about the risks of breast implantation, including cancer. Because health insurance, medical records, and standard information were incidents or means to heath services, the bill did not clearly have multiple subjects in violation of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 23. There was no &sect; 23 &quot;clear title&quot; violation due to the use of &quot;health services&quot; in the bill's title.</SPAN></P>

Because he was entitled to a limited declaratory judgment to this effect, the trial court's judgment was modified and such declaratory relief is granted. As modified, the trial court's judgment upholding the constitutionality of the statute was affirmed.

Defendant challenged trial court orders in each case to submit the matter to arbitration, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 226.095 (Supp. 1999). The statute superceded Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 435.465 (1994), which provided that arbitration agreements did not apply to governmental units. The legislature had agreed, on defendant's behalf, to arbitration by passing &sect; 226.095. Section 226.095 did not impermissibly delegate judicial power, because arbitration was a procedure apart from litigation. The state constitution did not prohibit the legislature from mandating or agreeing to arbitration and was within its power over defendant. Section 226.095 was not an unconstitutional &quot;special law&quot; which treated defendant differently from others similarly situated because defendant was the only entity of its kind. Section 226.095 was also not an unconstitutional regulation of the jurisdiction of the courts, as it involved arbitration, rather than a judicial proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial courts were affirmed because the challenged statute did not offend arbitration laws, since, by its passage, the legislature, on defendant's behalf, agreed to submit to arbitration, and the statute was not an unconstitutional delegation of judicial power or &quot;special law&quot; or otherwise beyond the authority of the state legislature. The writ of prohibition was quashed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was an independent marketer of generic, unbranded motor fuels. The attorney general invoked the Merchandising Practices Act (MPA), Mo. Rev.

The trial court entered judgment for defendants and plaintiff appealed. The appellate court concluded that the MPA and the Motor Fuel Marketing Act (MFMA), Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect;&sect; 416.600 - 416.640, operated separately, that the two statutes were not intended to overlap, and that the sale of motor fuel under the MFMA was not the kind of &quot;unfair practice&quot; encompassed by the MPA; thus, the attorney general had no authority to invoke the CID power conferred by the MPA. The instant court also held that the case was ripe for review; the state's attempted use of the CID power triggered a real and immediate controversy because use of the CID power was the first step toward the attempted enforcement of the MFMA against plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

MHTC contended the joint and several liability statute did not apply to the government unless specifically designated within the statute and challenged the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 537.067, the joint and several liability statute. The appellate court disagreed; the rule that the state be specifically named in the statute to be subject to tort liability was satisfied by express waiver of immunity in the limited class of torts in Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and armed criminal action for killing an acquaintance, who he shot seven times. He evaded capture for six months, during which he went on a crime spree, which included two more murders and multiple thefts of vehicles and weapons. He confessed to the first killing, but claimed the victim had threatened to kill him. The weapon was never recovered. He also confessed to the other murders. After hearing, he was found competent to stand trial despite his low I.Q. The jury was chosen from another county. Voir dire was conducted on the final venire members. In the penalty phase, the State submitted two statutory aggravating factors, a prior assault and depravity of mind. Defense experts testified defendant was borderline retarded, episodically psychotic, delusional, and brain damaged. Defendant did not attend this portion. The jury recommended death. The court affirmed, after independent death sentence review, finding no error or abuse of discretion in competency findings, jury selection, or evidentiary rulings. The verdict was supported by the evidence and the death sentence was not based on passion or prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. There was no error in competency determination or evidentiary rulings, despite defendant's low I.Q. scores. Choice to miss penalty phase testimony was understandable. There was no abuse of discretion in rulings on jury selection, change of venue, or in penalty phase. Death sentence was not imposed improperly, and was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

Inconsistent answers given by an African-American venirewoman were sufficient reasons for trial court to sustain strike for cause. After jury had been properly instructed, the trial court's decision not to answer a jury question about sentencing was not error. Defendant could not have raised question of racially tainted grand jury, because he had not challenged the validity of the statute permitting substitution of an information for an indictment at trial. It was not an abuse of discretion to overrule objections to prosecutor's argument that a troubled childhood did not dilute culpability, and his description of hardships suffered by the victims' families. State's references to the truthful testimony clause in co-perpetrator's plea bargain was not improper vouching. Trial court made essential findings that defendant's confession was voluntary and uncoerced, and its failure to elaborate the basis of that ruling with specificity was harmless error. The court concluded that the death sentences were proportionate as compared to similar cases. Convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Because appellant challenged the validity and constitutionality of the law, his appeal was transferred to the court. The court determined that the legislative intent of &sect; 589.400 was to require only persons coming into a county to register with the sheriff. Applying the rule of lenity, the court construed &sect; 589.400 not to require appellant to register because he had been a resident of Jackson County at all times since &sect; 589.400 became effective.

Appellant argued that due process required a refund of the full three years of taxes as provided by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.748 (Supp. 1992). The court held that the Due Process Clause required states to provide taxpayers with, not only a fair opportunity to challenge the accuracy and legal validity of their tax obligation, but also a clear and certain remedy for any erroneous or unlawful tax collection to ensure that the opportunity to contest the tax was a meaningful one. The court held that the clear and certain remedy provided by Mo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 144.190 was denied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant railway challenged the Circuit Court of Jackson County's (Missouri) $ 1.5 million judgment for respondent worker in his Federal Employer's Liability Act suit after his hand was injured when a chain broke while he was helping in track repair, he underwent eight surgeries, and appellant disqualified him from work and discontinued him from its wage continuation program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wash-out repair of train tracks was not within respondent's general duties, but appellant railway assigned him and his crew to do it and use crane chains which they had never done. A chain broke crushing respondent's fingers. After three years, many surgeries, some attempts at work, and failing appellant's field test, respondent was disqualified from working for appellant. Respondent sued under the Federal Employer's Liability Act and before his third trial was videotaped using his injured hand by appellant's investigator, and deposed without appellant's disclosure of the tapes. Use of that deposition, but not of the tapes was prohibited by the trial court. Respondent was awarded $ 1.5 million, which the court upheld. The jury could have inferred that appellant provided an unsafe work environment. Respondent's negligence in putting his hand under raised tracks did not completely bar his recovery. As respondent failed to show prejudice and thus unseasonable Mo. R. Civ. P. 56.01(e) disclosure of the tapes, the trial court's prohibition as to appellant had been error, however the error was harmless.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Trial court erred in prohibiting appellant's use of deposition of respondent taken before disclosure to him of video of him using his &quot;injured&quot; hand, because respondent had failed to show prejudice and thus unseasonable disclosure. However the error was harmless as the video itself had been admitted as evidence. Though inadmissible to show negligence per se, OSHA regulations admissibly showed a standard of care.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, the decedent's widow and children, brought a wrongful death action against defendant driver and respondent, the restaurant that served beer to defendant driver after he allegedly was obviously intoxicated. The relevant statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.053.3 (1994), only authorized a claim where the liquor licensee had been convicted or had received a suspended imposition of sentence for violating Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 311.310 (1994). The prosecuting attorney declined to charge respondent. Therefore, the trial court granted summary judgment for respondent. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and allowed appellants to pursue their remedy because a portion of the statute was unconstitutional. The court determined that &sect; 537.053.3 violated the &quot;open courts&quot; provision of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 14, by requiring a criminal conviction before a plaintiff could bring a civil action. The statute erected an arbitrary and unreasonable barrier to appellants' legally recognized remedy.</SPAN></P>

The court held the admission fees were a tax that did not violate interstate commerce. The admission fees were not payments for a special privilege, a special service, or a specific purpose. A substantial nexus existed with Missouri, appellants' were not subject to taxation by other states, there was no issue of unfair apportionment, and Missouri treated intrastate the same as interstate commerce. The reimbursements for services by the patrol were not beyond the sole purpose of the commission fund. The patrol reimbursements compensated for the full cost of gaming agents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, who were owners of real property in the Lebanon R-III and Morgan County R-II School Districts, brought suit to challenge the operating levies of appellees, the school districts and individual school board members, for the years 1994 through 1998. The circuit court granted summary judgments for appellees, the schools. The appellate court held that because the burden was on the appellees (the schools) to show as a matter of law that they were entitled to summary judgment, the judgments were to be reversed in part and the causes remanded. Appellees failed to prove that annual adjustments to the maximum authorized current levy were not required under Mo. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state of Missouri granted appellant a permit to erect a billboard along an interstate within appellee city. Thereafter, appellant applied to appellee for a permit to erect the billboard. Appellee denied the permit application because the billboard did not comply with its more restrictive regulations. Appellant filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that the bills that created and amended Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.288 (Supp. 1999), which allows cities and counties to more restrictively regulate billboards, were constitutionally invalid. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court affirmed. It held that appellant failed to demonstrate that billboards were &quot;clearly and undoubtedly&quot; not germane to transportation. Both the federal and Missouri state governments had recognized that the transportation system, specifically the interstate system and the primary highway system, was impacted by the effective control of outdoor advertising structures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; nothing prevented Missouri from increasing the level of restrictiveness, either at the state or the local level, of billboard regulation along federal highways. Billboard regulation was inextricably linked to highway transportation because the very function of billboards was to capture the attention of the travelling public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the validity of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 479.500, which authorized the establishment of a traffic court, the appointment of traffic judges, and procedures to be followed in the traffic court, and &sect; 302.535, which enabled the presiding judge of the circuit court to assign a traffic judge to hear cases pursuant to the provisions of &sect; 479.500. The court concluded that as construed and applied in the twenty-first judicial circuit, the statutes passed constitutional muster. However, the court concluded the appellants were not afforded an opportunity to challenge the commissioner's findings of facts in a meaningful manner. The presiding judge entered judgment based on the traffic court commissioner's findings the same or next day that the commissioner entered findings of facts. These short amounts of time were inadequate times in which to challenge the commissioner's findings in the circuit court before an article V judge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for attempted enticement of a child under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.151 because there were two charged actions - the showing of a pornographic film to a minor and a direct solicitation to the victim asking her whether she wanted to know what the actions occurring in the pornographic film felt like; there was action from defendant indicative of his purpose to entice or lure the victim into sexual conduct; [2]-The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit expert testimony on biasing factors for which there was no evidence in the case because such testimony would not have had any logical relevance to any issue to be decided by the jury and its legal relevance was also questionable as it would only have served to obfuscate and confuse the jury.</SPAN></P>

At the time of the invocations, movant's exposure to a criminal conviction had advanced beyond simply being arrested; actual evidence presented by the prosecutor that movant had refused to answer questions based upon the Fifth Amendment about the document he was alleged to have forged was a much greater direction of the jury's attention to the fact that movant exercised his right not to testify than what would have flowed from a prohibited reference made during voir dire.</SPAN></P>

Because the property owner was entitled to present a decision by the county board of equalization as its sole evidence of the fair market value of the property, and because the STC acted within its discretion in concluding that the board's determination was competent and persuasive evidence, the STC did not err in its valuation finding.</SPAN></P>
