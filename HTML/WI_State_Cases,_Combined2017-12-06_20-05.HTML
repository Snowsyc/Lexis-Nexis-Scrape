</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a one-car rollover accident. While speaking with defendant, the driver of the car, the police noticed a strong odor of intoxicants, that defendant's speech was slurred, his eyes appeared glassy, and that his face was flushed. Defendant agreed to submit to a preliminary breath test, which showed his blood alcohol level at .26 percent. At the hospital, defendant agreed to submit to an evidentiary chemical test of his blood, which revealed that he had a blood alcohol level of .10 percent. On appeal, defendant argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(4) (1999-2000) was unconstitutional, and therefore, the blood test was taken without valid consent or a search warrant. The instant court held that &sect; 343.305(4) was not unconstitutional, as a condition of obtaining a driver's license, a would-be motorist consented to submit to a chemical search for blood alcohol content if arrested for driving while intoxicated. Further, because the bodily intrusion the motorist was being asked to allow was a minimal one, the choice between retaining driving privileges and refusing to submit to an intoxication test was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that Wisconsin's implied consent law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305 (1999-2000), to the extent it punished him for refusing to submit to a chemical test, was unconstitutional, as it violated his right to refuse to consent to searches and seizures. Defendant also argued that the State's conditioning of the receipt of a driver's license on the relinquishment of the right to be free from searches and seizures violated his U.S. Const. amend. IV rights. The appellate court rejected defendant's claims. The court concluded that the implied consent law was not unconstitutionally coercive, as there was no constitutional right to operate a motor vehicle, and the State's conditioning of the receipt of a driver's license on consenting to chemical testing was a reasonable measure to combat the problem of drunk driving.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from a judgment of the circuit court for Jefferson County: WILLIAM F. HUE, Judge. Cir. Ct. No. 02-CV-51.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver appealed a judgment convicting him of operating a motor vehicle with a prohibited alcohol concentration, first offense. He claimed the Circuit Court for Jefferson County (Wisconsin) erred in denying his motion to suppress the results of a blood test, because the arresting officer: (1) lacked probable cause to arrest him; and (2) failed to honor his request for an alternative test for alcohol concentration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record established the points the officer relied on in determining that there was probable cause for an operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant (OMVWI) arrest, and, more importantly, the record supported the factual findings of the trial court. The appellate court concluded that, even if it had not considered the driver's refusal to submit to a preliminary breath test (PBT), probable cause existed to arrest him for OMVWI based on, inter alia: (1) his erratic driving, which caused an oncoming vehicle to slow or move over; (2) his &quot;red and glassy&quot; eyes and the strong odor of intoxicants; and (3) the presence of six out of six clues on the horizontal gaze nystagmus. The appellate court also concluded that the record supported the finding that the driver had not requested an alternative test. The driver testified that his discussion with the officer about a breath test took place at about the time he was read the informing the accused. That occurred before his transport to the hospital for the blood draw, and, thus, well before he submitted to the requested blood test. The driver could not recall making any further mention of a breath test thereafter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to forgery, and her probation was later revoked. The Circuit Court for Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, sentenced defendant to 18 months' imprisonment followed by 24 months of extended supervision. A condition of defendant's extended supervision required her to introduce any person she was &quot;dating&quot; to her supervising agent. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the report supporting the revocation of defendant's probation, defendant's supervising agent alleged that she had stolen and forged personal checks from her former and current boyfriends. The trial court determined that the condition was appropriate to protect the public from future crimes that defendant may be inclined to commit. Defendant argued that the ambiguity of the term &quot;dating&quot; rendered the condition unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court ruled that the statutory definition of &quot;dating relationship&quot; set out in Wis. Stat. &sect; 813.12(1)(ag) (1999-2000) provided an objective standard for enforcement, and provided defendant with adequate notice of when she must introduce to her agent any person with whom she was involved in an intimate social relationship. Defendant had fair and adequate notice that, not only did the statute differentiate between a romantic or intimate social relationship and a casual relationship or an ordinary fraternization, but common sense would also lead one to arrive at that distinction. When defendant was involved in something more than a platonic relationship with someone of the opposite sex, she must introduce that person to her agent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed the prison's disciplinary decision as defendant failed to prove that he had not lied about a staff member harassing him. The appellate court upheld the trial court's rulings. The appellate court noted that defendant's challenge that the time limit in Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.735(2) was too short was not a proper subject for review. Also, the instant court affirmed that defendant was not entitled to judicial relief before exhausting his administrative remedies. The appellate court also affirmed the trial court's affirmance of the prison's disciplinary sanction as defendant's First Amendment rights were not violated by a rule that punished prisoners for making false statements against prison staff members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney challenged the order of the Circuit Court for La Crosse County, Wisconsin, which imposed sanctions on him for filing what the circuit court deemed to be a frivolous suppression motion in a drunk driving case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney's client was stopped in the early morning hours for operating his motorcycle at 45 miles per hour in a 30 mile-per-hour zone. After the stop, the officer detected an odor of alcohol on the client's breath, and the client admitted to drinking some beer. The officer then detained the client for field sobriety testing. In his suppression motion, the attorney argued that the officers lacked reasonable suspicion to detain his client and administer sobriety tests. The circuit court found that the motion was without a good faith basis in either fact or law. On appeal, the attorney contended that the relevant statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 802.05(1) (1999-2000), did not apply in criminal cases. The court did not reach that question, determining instead that the attorney had a good faith basis to bring a suppression motion, even if &sect; 802.05(1) applied. The State did not locate any case upholding a temporary detention with the same circumstances presented by the arrest of the attorney's client. The court held, therefore, that the attorney could reasonably have argued that similar cases, though relevant, were distinguishable and should not control the outcome in his client's case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the order imposing sanctions on counsel, concluding that, while even a weak odor of intoxicants on a driver's breath, combined with a speeding violation at bar time, constituted reasonable suspicion, it was not frivolous to argue otherwise.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 343.305(10) (1999-2000) on the ground that she refused to submit to a chemical test of her breath following her arrest for driving under the influence of an intoxicant in violation of Wis.

The motorist contended on appeal that &sect; 343.305(2) was unconstitutional because &sect; 343.305(2) forced an operator of an automobile to choose between abandoning his or her Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures and suffering the sanction of lost driving privileges. The court reviewed the matter de novo. The court held that &sect; 343.305(2) was constitutional. The court decided that an operator's consent to a chemical test under &sect; 343.305(2) was not involuntary for Fourth Amendment purposes solely because the operator had to choose between submission to the test and loss of driving privileges. The court determined that the motorist conceded the point on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the Circuit Court for Iowa County (Wisconsin) for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.163(1)(a) (1999-2000). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's argument was that the implied consent statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305, was unconstitutional because it forced him to choose between abandoning his U.S. Const. amend. IV protection against unreasonable searches and seizures and suffering the sanction of lost driving privileges. The trial court concluded the statute was not unconstitutional. The issue properly framed was whether the U.S. Const. amend. IV intrusion authorized by the statute was reasonable. The appellate court concluded that it was. No one was forced to operate a motor vehicle on the roads of Wisconsin; thus, conditioning that privilege on giving consent to the chemical tests as prescribed in the statute was not coercive. The tests authorized by statute were safe, relatively painless, and commonplace, and they may be given only when there was probable cause to believe the person was violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1) or similar statutes. Finally, the appellate court found that the State had a compelling interest in keeping intoxicated drivers off the roads.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 980 (1999-2000). The Circuit Court for Eau Claire County, Wisconsin, granted the petition and entered an order committing the inmate. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.37(8)(b) (1999-2000) disqualified the State's expert witnesses at his commitment hearing because they were associated with certain mental health facilities. He also argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.61 (1999-2000), patients rights, applied to prisoners' initial Wis. Stat. ch. 980 (1999-2000) proceedings. The appeals court held the inmate's arguments failed for two reasons. First, ch. 980 specifically directed the state's health department to have close connections with the experts who conduct mental health evaluations. The legislature did not intend the evaluators would have no connection with state institutions as would be required if Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.37(8)(b) applied. Second, the right to examination by experts who were not associated with the department was not included in the list of enumerated patients' rights under Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.61. The appeals court also held that failure to apply Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.37(8)(b) to sexual predators did not violate their due process rights, as there was no constitutional right to a court-appointed independent evaluator. Finally, the State presented sufficient evidence that the inmate was highly likely to reoffend.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the cause was remanded for a trial to determine whether the inmate was within 90 days of release or discharge when this action was commenced.</SPAN></P>

Looking to other cases that had already decided the issue, the appellate court determined that the pressure employed by the statute to obtain a motorist's consent was not unreasonable and did not violate Fourth Amendment protections. Because the bodily intrusion the driver was asked to allow was a minimal one, the choice between retaining driving privileges and refusing to submit to an intoxication test was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent office of the commissioner of insurance determined that appellant motor vehicle association must cease and desist from marketing and servicing its pre-paid traffic ticket program in Wisconsin until it obtained a certificate of authority pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 601.04(2), 610.11 (1999-2000). The Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, affirmed, and the association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the association contended, inter alia, that its program was a service provided to its members, not insurance, and that it was not doing an insurance business in Wisconsin. The appellate court concluded that the commissioner's decision that the program was insurance was a reasonable interpretation and application of that term as used in Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 610.11, 601.04(2) (1999-2000) in that there was no dispute that the association agreed to reimburse subscribers for loss in the form of traffic fines and forfeitures in exchange for monthly payments. Further, the commissioner had the statutory authority to regulate an entity that met the requirements of &quot;doing an insurance business,&quot; as defined in Wis. Stat. &sect; 618.02(2) (1999-2000), even if no Wisconsin resident was an insured. The commissioner had a rational basis for not exempting the association's program from the applicable statutory requirements.  Wis. Stat. &sect; 600.03(25) (1999-2000) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the association; the definition of &quot;insurance&quot; applied by the commissioner did not implicate the association's First Amendment rights, and the doctrine of overbreadth had no application.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for La Crosse County, Wisconsin, granted the competitor summary judgment, finding that the store had violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 100.30 (1999-2000) of the Wisconsin Unfair Sales Act. The store appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the store challenged the trial court's grant of summary judgment. The appellate court concluded that the competitor was entitled as a matter of law to a judgment that the store violated the Act by selling motor vehicle fuel below the statutory cost with the effect of injuring the competitor. Whether the store was a wholesaler or retailer under the Act was irrelevant as, either way, the proper terminal for computing the &quot;average posted terminal price&quot; was the terminal closest to the store's gas station. The store was a competitor with respect to diesel fuel because both parties offered that fuel for sale to vehicles in the same geographic area. Wis. Stat. &sect; 100.30(3) (1999-2000) prohibited sales below statutory cost with either the proscribed intent or the proscribed effect. It was undisputed that the store did not fall within the exception in Wis. Stat. &sect; 100.30(6)(a)7 (1999-2000) for meeting a competitor's price. The Act was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the store and did not offend due process by prohibiting certain conduct or by its effect, regardless of the seller's intent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant club challenged a decision from the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which granted summary judgment in favor of respondent village in a declaratory action challenging the village's act of rezoning and conveying property as contrary to village ordinances and state laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The club contended that the village rezoned and conveyed property to an organization in violation of certain ordinances and statutes. It brought a declaratory action to determine the validity of the conveyance. The trial court determined that the club did not have standing to pursue the action; therefore, it granted the village's motion for summary judgment. The club contended that it had standing as a taxpayer and a property owner to challenge the action. In affirming, the court determined that the club was unable to maintain a declaratory judgment action under Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.04 unless a justiciable controversy existed. The club was required to have a personal stake in the outcome. Moreover, it must have been directly affected by the issues in the controversy. This was measured by whether the club would have sustained some pecuniary loss or substantial injury to its interests. The club failed to present any evidence to suggest that it was adversely affected, financially or otherwise, by the village's actions. The club's disagreement with the legislative decisions of the village was insufficient to confer standing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Walworth County (Wisconsin) denied defendant's motion to suppress the blood alcohol concentration evidence, and defendant pled no contest to operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. The informing the accused form was read to him, and he consented to a blood alcohol test. Prior to trial, he moved to suppress the blood alcohol test evidence, contending, inter alia, that any implied consent to have blood taken from him was a coerced consent by operation of the penalty structure of the implied consent statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(2) (1999-2000), and was thereby constitutionally invalid. On appeal, defendant maintained that the state-sponsored coercion in the implied consent statute of either taking a blood alcohol test or losing one's license exerted a psychological toll on motorists at the time the motorists were asked to take the blood alcohol test, overbearing their will, and compelling them to consent to taking a test. The appellate court held that the time of consent to the test was when a driver's license was obtained and not when defendant was arrested; thus, there was no psychological pressure on him when he obtained his license. Also, even if the coercive event took place at the time the informing the accused form was read, it was an entirely reasonable form of coercion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendants contended their actions did not constitute disorderly conduct under the language of the ordinance. The appellate court ruled that defendants' conduct was not constitutionally protected and that their actions constituted disorderly conduct under the ordinance. The loud abusive language used by defendant, husband, was overheard by others, occurring after he had been drinking, in a public place, and in the presence of the police and others. Considering these circumstances, the trial court did not err by finding his actions were of a type tending to cause or provoke a disturbance. Furthermore, the actions of defendant, wife, tended to cause or provoke a disturbance as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim reported to police that he and his girlfriend, and their four children, parked their car at a grocery store and the girlfriend went inside for a short time. While the girlfriend was in the store, the victim recognized defendant from the neighborhood and exited the car to say hello to him. Eventually, the greeting turned into a confrontation with defendant, defendant's brother and about seven other men. The appellate court ruled that since defendant's conduct endangered three victims, three charges and multiple punishments were constitutionally sound. Also, a jury acting reasonably could have found defendant's threat to &quot;take it up on his own&quot; to infer that defendant was intimidating the victim with a threat of force and the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for intimidation of a victim with threat of force or violence, Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.45(3) (1999-2000). Furthermore, the First Amendment simply did not protect speech or acts which threatened harm to a victim of crime, which were done with the purpose of thwarting prosecution of a crime. Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.45(3) (1999-2000) did not chill protected speech and was not constitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 782.09 (1999-2000). The appellate court found that: (1) a writ of habeas corpus was not available to appellant because he failed to raise the issues on direct appeal and he failed to provide a valid reason to excuse his failure to raise the issues on appeal or to show that the remedy of appeal was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention, and (2) the issue of damages under the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 782.09 (1999-2000) was deemed abandoned because appellant failed to develop any argument to support his claim.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court revoked defendant's privileges after it concluded he had no basis to refuse to consent to a chemical test of his blood alcohol content. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the implied consent law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305 (1999-2000), arguing its provision mandating revocation for an improper refusal to submit to testing punished him for exercising his Fourth Amendment right to refuse to consent to searches and seizures. The appellate court ruled that Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305 (1999-2000) did not punish defendant for exercising his constitutional rights. Defendant was not coerced into consenting to submit to chemical testing or unfairly punished for withdrawing that consent. The State was not punishing defendant for exercising his constitutional right, and any punishment he suffered arose because he revoked his consent to be tested.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer posed as a 13-year-old boy on the internet and discussed erotic wrestling in a chat room with defendant. At defendant's suggestion, they agreed to meet at a restaurant before going to a hotel to engage in erotic wrestling. Defendant then packed his wrestling bag and drove to meet the boy, and was arrested. On appeal, defendant argued Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.07 was unconstitutional because it violated free speech, the evidence was insufficient for conviction, he was essentially convicted of attempting to attempt, the trial court erroneously admitted other acts evidence, and that the trial court erroneously exercised its sentencing discretion. The appellate court initially resolved defendant's first three arguments by noting the First Amendment did not protect child enticements, whether initiated over the internet or otherwise, and lack of an actual child victim did not render a child enticement charge non-existent. The appellate court held the other acts evidence was properly admitted to negate defendant's potential innocent explanation for his conduct. The appellate court concluded the trial court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 980 (1999-2000), was released on supervision to a community corrections program halfway house. Petitioner Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services sought to revoke his supervised release. The Circuit Court for Rock County, Wisconsin, revoked his supervised release to the community and committed him indefinitely to the Wisconsin Resource Center. Respondent appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a hearing, the circuit court found that the safety of the public required respondent's commitment to a secure facility. On appeal, respondent contended that one of the rules of his supervised release was unconstitutionally vague, that the petition provided insufficient notice of the allegations against him, and that the circuit court did not adequately consider alternatives to revoking his supervised release. The court found that respondent's challenge to a rule that required him to avoid all conduct not in the best interest of the public's welfare or his own rehabilitation failed, as his behavior plainly fell within the rule's scope, since an ordinary person would have been cognizant that obtaining a prescription for a sexual-performance enhancing drug was not in the public's or in respondent's best interest. The court also held that the petition afforded respondent adequate notice, and, in any event, that respondent did not alleged prejudice. Lastly, the court held that upon a finding that the safety of others required revocation, Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.06(2)(d) (1997-98) removed any discretion from the circuit court to consider alternatives to revocation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to homicide by use of a motor vehicle with a prohibited alcohol concentration in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.09(1)(b) (1997-98). The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) sentenced defendant under truth-in-sentencing to 21 years of incarceration followed by nine years of extended supervision. Defendant appealed and alleged the sentencing court committed a number of errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving drunk when he struck the car in which the victim was riding. The collision killed the victim. Defendant alleged that the sentencing court erred by (1) not stating with great specificity the reason for the sentence that was imposed, (2) considering the victim's good character, and comparing his character to the victim's character, and (3) by imposing a sentence that was too harsh based on his age and background. The appellate court held that while courts are required to state the reasons for imposing a particular sentence, they are not required to state with specificity why they are imposing one set of years as opposed to another. The court noted that as victim impact statements were permitted at sentencing hearings, it was a logical corollary that the victim's character be considered as well. Further, it was unreasonable for the court not to consider both the victim and defendant's character when presented with evidence of both. Finally, given defendant's juvenile history, his unwillingness to deal with his addictions, and his blood alcohol level at the time of the accident, the sentence was not so excessive and unusual to shock public sentiment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to suppress evidence that was seized from his vehicle when he was stopped because a police officer believed he was the suspect in a domestic abuse incident. The Circuit Court for Rock County, Wisconsin, granted defendant's motion to suppress on the grounds that the officer who stopped defendant did not have reasonable grounds for an investigative detention. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four days before stopping defendant, the officer had responded to a domestic abuse call. The girlfriend described her boyfriend as a black male in his 20's and stated that he was driving a dark blue Chevrolet Euro 90's model with a red pinstripe and tinted windows. The officer observed defendant driving a similar car near the girlfriend's house. Defendant was pulled over and identified himself as someone other than the suspect, but did not have any identification on him. Defendant was subsequently searched and the police asked if they could search his car. Defendant allegedly consented and cocaine was found in the trunk. The appellate court held the officer had sufficient facts to provide reasonable suspicion that defendant was the suspect in the domestic abuse incident as the car was sufficiently similar to that described by the girlfriend, was within a few blocks of the incident, and he met the general description of the suspect. The time between the complaint and the stop was not so great as to render the stop unconstitutional. However, as the facts surrounding the search of the car were unclear, the matter needed to be remanded to determine if the police had consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting the motion to suppress was reversed and the matter was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff individual was injured at a fireworks show and sued defendants, a lake club and a fireworks company, for negligence. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) entered judgment against the lake club for 50 percent of the individual's damages award and against the fireworks company for 19 percent. The individual appealed, contending that the circuit court erred in concluding defendants were not jointly and severally liable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual argued that because she was free of any negligence, the 1995 amendment to the comparative negligence statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.045(1) (1999-2000), modifying joint and several liability, did not apply. The individual also maintained that statutes in derogation of the common law had to be strictly construed so as not to alter the common law unless such legislative intent was clear beyond a reasonable doubt, and because the amendment to Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.045 could not be construed to alter the common law, her undisputed lack of any contributory negligence carried her beyond the statute's grasp. The appellate court disagreed, holding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.045(1) (1999-2000) was clear on its face. Only a tortfeasor found to be 51percent or more causally negligent could be jointly and severally liable for a plaintiff's total damages. Here, therefore, based on the jury's apportionment of negligence, the circuit court correctly concluded that neither the lake club nor the fireworks company could be held jointly or severally liable for the individual's damages, and properly entered judgment against them for their respective 50 percent and 19 percent portions of the award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that he was denied due process of law, as he was not personally served with a raze order, and because the notice provision of the raze order statute,&nbsp;Wis.

I, &sect;9; and the trial court erred in granting summary judgment, as mitigation remained a material factual issue. The appellate court found that the city complied with the statute exactly as it was written. The city attempted personal service at the owner's residence five times. The city published the raze order, posted it on his property, and recorded it with the county register of deeds. The city's posting the raze order on the owner's building presented the owner with the opportunity to seek the statutory remedy of Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.0413(h) (1999-2000). The owner was not denied the right to do so. The owner waived any arguments about mitigation, as he did not bring his assertions of error to the trial court's attention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Calumet County (Wisconsin) denied defendant's motion challenging the constitutionality of the statutory provisions establishing the prohibited alcohol concentration for a fourth offense of operating a motor vehicle with a prohibited alcohol concentration and entered a judgment of conviction upon his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant's motion was pending, he entered a guilty plea to the charge of operating a motor vehicle with a prohibited alcohol concentration of .02 percent. Because defendant pled guilty to the charge, the appellate court did not address the substantive issues he raised on appeal. Also, defendant's equal protection argument did not go to the very power of the State to require him to appear in court to answer the charges brought against him. Defendant's equal protection argument was limited to a complaint about a legislatively created classification of prohibited alcohol concentration and not the power of the State to require him to answer drunk driving charges in court. Additionally, in order to have standing to challenge a statute as unconstitutional, defendant had to show that the statute injured him and that he was within the zone intended to be protected by the constitutional guarantee. The appellate court concluded that defendant could not show that he was injured by the constitutional infirmities he alleged as his blood alcohol concentration of .113 percent was sufficient to establish a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(b) (1999-2000) even for a first time offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile sold marijuana while in school. Her case was referred to an intake worker, who then referred the case to the district attorney with a recommendation that the district attorney file a delinquency petition and enter into a consent decree. The district attorney filed a delinquency petition, but determined a consent decree was inappropriate. The circuit court granted the juvenile's motion to dismiss the petition and referred the case back to the intake worker for deferred prosecution. The juvenile then entered into a deferred prosecution agreement. Thereafter, the district attorney attempted to unilaterally terminate the deferred prosecution agreement by filing a second delinquency petition containing the same charge and factual allegations as the first petition. Once more, the circuit court granted the juvenile's motion to dismiss and referred the case for deferred prosecution. The State appealed. The court of appeals held that pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 938.21(7) (1999-2000), the circuit court was permitted to order the dismissal and refer the matter for deferred prosecution without the consent of the district attorney, and that the statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injunction ordered defendant to refrain from harassing the victim or having any contact with the victim's events.

The case was brought in the county where the injunction was issued rather than where defendant violated the injunction. The appellate court found that: (1) defendant was barred from collaterally attacking the underlying injunction; (2) the complaint was sufficient, as it contained the facts necessary to allow a reasonable person to conclude that defendant violated the harassment injunction; (3) venue was improper in Iowa County, Wisconsin, as defendant did not engage in acts in Iowa County, Wisconsin, that were requisite to the commission of the offense; and (4) the proper remedy for trial of a criminal case in an improper venue was reversal of the conviction and transfer to the proper venue.</SPAN></P>

On review, defendant argued that his motion to suppress evidence should have been granted because the ordinance under which he was stopped, Monroe, Wis., Ordinance 9-4-20(B), was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court disagreed, finding that not all unnecessary and annoying noise was prohibited; the ordinance only regulated noise created by squealing tires, excessive acceleration of engine or by emitting unnecessary and loud muffler noises. The officer stopped defendant for excessive acceleration. The appellate court concluded that the circumstances were set out with sufficient specificity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a municipal community development authority (condemnor), petitioned the Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, for a writ of assistance under Wis. Stat. &sect; 32.05(8) (1999-2000) to oust defendant, an owner and operator of a restaurant, from premises that had been condemned.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner asserted the circuit court erred in granting the writ because &quot;a comparable replacement property&quot; was not &quot;made available&quot; to it as required by &sect; 32.05(8) in that the cost to purchase and remodel the only property identified by the condemnor which met the owner's criteria far exceeded the amount the owner would receive from the condemnor. It was uncontested that the owner had not waived its right to receive relocation benefits, and was a &quot;displaced person&quot; within the meaning of Wis. Stat. &sect; 32.19(2)(e) (1999-2000), and that the condemnor had deposited with the circuit court the maximum business replacement payment allowable under &sect; 32.19(4) for owner-occupied business premises. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 32.05(8) (1999-2000) granted a condemnee no rights beyond those authorized under the relocation assistance statutes, and that by identifying potential replacement properties, obtaining renovation cost estimates, tendering the maximum replacement payment, and offering reimbursement for other statutorily authorized relocation expenses, the condemnor had &quot;made available&quot; a comparable replacement property to the extent required by the relocation assistance law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not accept responsibility for his crime or try to get treatment. The appellate court found that the original two convictions for enticement were multiplicitous, reversed one, but then concluded that it had to vacate all the sentences imposed and remand. The trial court ordered an updated presentence report, for which defendant did not cooperate. At resentencing, defendant addressed the trial court, acknowledged responsibility, and apologized. His prison behavior was found to have been good. The appellate court found that the trial court affirmatively stated on the record the grounds for increasing the sentence on the assault conviction, and that the grounds were based on objective, identifiable factual information derived from events occurring after the original sentencing that warranted an increase in sentence. Thus defendant was not denied due process. The trial court could reasonably decide that defendant's positive conduct did not overcome his need for sex-offender treatment, and that longer incarceration was needed given his failure for four years to seek treatment. The trial court did not disbelieve defendant's tardy expression of remorse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to quash two search warrants and to suppress the evidence obtained. The Circuit Court for Marquette County (Wisconsin) denied the motions, and after a jury trial, convicted defendant of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and without the required tax stamps. Defendant appealed and sought a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A proven confidential informant (CI) told federal drug agents that defendant was a large-scale trafficker using Wisconsin property to conceal narcotics, and had a white semi-trailer with a hidden roof compartment for drugs. The CI gave the agents a phone number connected to a specific property. About six months later, Wisconsin police noticed such a semi on the property with tracks in the snow less than two weeks old, and based on all this information, got a search warrant. They made search; found the compartment, firearms, and drugs; learned from witnesses of activity at another property of defendant's; based on all this, got a second warrant; and discovered 32 marijuana bricks there. The appellate court found that the facts alleged in the warrants sufficiently showed that the CI provided reliable, non-stale information. The facts had been specific and the six-month lag, though a close call, was not too long given the long-term nature of drug trafficking.  Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 139.87-139.96 (1997-98), the drug tax stamp law, was constitutional. The two convictions did not constitute double jeopardy. Different fingerprints on the bricks were not inconsistent with defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer requested a search warrant based upon information he received from a confidential informant. The informant voluntarily offered information regarding drug activity witnessed at a party at defendant's house. The trial judge granted the application and issued a search warrant. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court should have granted his motion to suppress evidence derived from what he contended was an illegally executed search warrant. The appellate court held that the informant's affidavit provided a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed, and the judge had sufficient facts to believe that drugs would be found in the house. The veracity and basis of knowledge of the informant were established, because the informant had provided truthful and accurate information in the past, and the information was based on first-hand observations and conversations from the party. Further, the information established probable cause, because there was a close chronological proximity between the informant's observations and a subsequent party, and it was a reasonable inference that there would be drugs at the subsequent party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with four counts of possession of cocaine, a controlled substance. She pled guilty to two of the charges. The trial court sentenced her to prison, followed by probation and a driver's license suspension. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in giving defendant her sentence. The trial court properly addressed the gravity of the offense and the need to protect the community from drug trafficking. The trial court correctly found good reason to place defendant in a structured environment, given the fact that she failed to avail herself of community-based treatment services. After taking into account the gravity of the offense and defendant's criminal history, the court found no basis for defendant's claim that the sentence was excessive. Because there was nothing to indicate that defendant would have been treated differently by the trial court had she been male, defendant's equal protection argument failed. The conditions of probation did not violate defendant's right to privacy and free association because the conditions were related to her rehabilitation and the protection of the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the original placement order, the parties' minor children were seven and five years of age. They were 17 and 14 when the trial court modified the placement order from a 64/36 percent distribution of time to a 50/50 percent distribution of time, reflecting an increase of placement with the father of 50 days per year. On appeal, the wife contended inter alia that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that there was a substantial change in circumstances. The court disagreed, finding that the substantial increase in the ages of the children, and the substantial deterioration in the parent's attitudes towards each other, supported the circuit court's finding. The court also held that substantial evidence supported the circuit court's decision to vacate its previous child support order in view of the change of placement. And, because the wife failed to timely file a reply brief, the court summarily granted, without reaching the merits, the husband's contention on appeal that the trial court erred when it denied his request for costs, and that it erred when it failed to retroactively modify its previous support order.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. A meaningful treating relationship between a therapist and patient was built on confidence, trust, and confidentiality. In such a relationship, the patient was extremely vulnerable. When the therapist sexually abused that relationship, it was understandable that the patient might have experienced uncertainty, guilt, embarrassment, or shame. As a result, the patient might have delayed in reporting the matter or might never have reported it. The victim saw defendant numerous times in a treatment setting and indicated that he did not realize at first the sexual nature of defendant's contact with him. When the victim realized the gravity of the situation, he found himself too embarrassed and ashamed to reveal it. Even assuming that that the victim's age and intelligence rendered him able to report the incidents, the nature and circumstances surrounding the events represent the most compelling factor in explaining the victim's delay in reporting the matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Early one morning, a police officer arrested defendant for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, first offense. The officer read defendant information from the implied consent form taken from Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 343.305. Thereafter, defendant submitted to the drawing of a blood sample. The blood test revealed an alcohol concentration in excess of the legal limit. Defendant moved to suppress evidence. He argued his consent through the implied consent law was coerced. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant was then found guilty. After judgment was entered against him, the appellate court found there was no improper coercion or police conduct, and, thus, defendant's consent was voluntarily given. The appellate court first noted that under Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 343.305, drivers were deemed to have consented to the testing of their blood for alcohol concentration, and if a driver refused to submit to a lawful request for testing, his or her driving privileges could be revoked. It, therefore, concluded that the officer did not use coercion in truthfully informing defendant that his driving privileges could be revoked for refusing to submit to the testing.</SPAN></P>

He first contended the draw of his blood was unconstitutional under the U.S. Const. amend. IV because the State could have made a breath test available instead. The appellate court concluded the blood draw did not violate the Fourth Amendment. His second contention was that the testing of his blood for alcohol was a search under the Fourth Amendment and was a separate search from the drawing of his blood. Defendant went on to argue that the separate search violated the Fourth Amendment because it is a warrantless search that was not justified by exigent circumstances and was without consent. The appellate court held, based on precedent, that the seizure of defendant's blood was permitted under the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. The appellate court further held the analysis of his legally seized blood was not a separate search for Fourth Amendment purposes, and since his blood was legally seized, the blood analysis was lawful whether he consented or not.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. It was apparent that the statement did not affect the verdict. Defendant told an uninterested witness that she was alone. Defendant was found in the driver's seat shortly after the engine stopped running. She asked for gasoline so she could drive to town. There was no evidence to corroborate her testimony that someone else was driving. Police officers responding to the call did not observe anyone walking for help in the vicinity of the incident. Defendant failed to produce the alleged driver's name until almost eight weeks after her arrest, and she explained at trial the delay was because she barely knew him. The alleged driver testified that he was not the driver, and that he did not even know defendant at the time of her arrest. There was no reasonable probability that suppressing the statement would have led to a different result in the case. Therefore, counsel was not ineffective for failing to move for suppression.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. When an officer was faced with an objection to a blood draw based on a fear of needles, even when supported by a prior incident, the officer had very little basis for evaluating the reasonableness of that objection. How was the officer to know whether the objection was based on a genuine and intense fear, or on a very common preference not to have one's skin pierced with a needle, or on a desire not to permit the gathering of evidence of intoxication. If, however, the person objecting also offered to take an alternative test, the officer at least had an objective basis for eliminating the possibility that the person's refusal was based on a desire to prevent gathering evidence of intoxication. Therefore, defendant's objection was not reasonable, and the trial court did not err by denying her motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with failure to comply with an officer's attempt to take a person into custody, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.415(2) (1999-2000). Defendant filed a pre-trial motion asking the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) to find &sect; 946.415&nbsp;unconstitutional on its face, which it did. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's wife reported to police that he had threatened her with a large knife. She locked herself in the bathroom. When the police arrived at the home, defendant came out and confronted them. At gunpoint, they ordered him to place his hands over his head and lie on the ground. He refused, told them to shoot him, then retreated into the home. His wife was able to escape and advised police that he had a gun and planned on using it. The appellate court found that the trial court erred when it found &sect; 946.415&nbsp;unconstitutional. Statutes were presumed constitutional. Punishing people for interfering with the police attempting to exercise lawful authority and deterring people from engaging in that interference provided a sufficient rational basis for the statute's enactment. The statute did not infringe on the Fourth Amendment since a person remaining in a house would not violate it if police could not lawfully order the person out. The statute did not implicate free speech or expression and the First Amendment. A phrase in the statute, &quot;lawful arrest,&quot; was not impermissibly vague in all of its possible applications.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in sentencing him as a third time OWI offender instead of as a second offender because his waiver of counsel in the prior case was not voluntary. The court of appeals agreed. When a prima facie showing was made that a prior conviction involved a violation of the right to counsel, the State had to overcome the presumption against waiver of counsel and prove that the defendant knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived the right to counsel in the prior proceeding. The State did not do so, both because the last minute filing of defendant's motion and supporting documents did not allow the State to obtain additional items from the record of the 1993 conviction (which was in a different county), and because the trial court did not give the State the opportunity to respond to the motion before ruling. The State did not argue that defendant's motion was properly denied as untimely, and thus the record indicated that the 1993 conviction was constitutionally suspect. Therefore, the trial court erred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, third offense.

Following defendant's guilty plea, the State sought forfeiture of defendant's vehicle, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.65(6) (1997-98). However, because the vehicle used in the commission of the offense was no longer titled to defendant, the State sought forfeiture of defendant's 1957 Triumph automobile. The Triumph was seized, the State commenced a forfeiture action, pursuant to &sect; 346.65(6), and the circuit court granted the State's forfeiture motion. The order was stayed pending appeal. On appeal, defendant contended that &sect; 346.65(6), as applied to the 1957 Triumph, was unconstitutional as violative of the Double Jeopardy Clause of United States Constitution, as well as Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court agreed, finding that &sect; 346.65(6) was unconstitutionally applied to defendant, as there was not an adequate nexus between the motor vehicle seized and the underlying offense to justify a forfeiture as a civil remedial sanction.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the complaint stated a claim for which relief could be granted, as it identified a justiciable controversy, whether the vacant land was properly designated as &quot;blighted.&quot; The complaint identified parties with adverse interests, alleged that the parties seeking relief had an identifiable interest, and the controversy was ripe for determination. The injuries identified included: the inability of the parties to use and enjoy their residences by decreasing the green space that was used for recreation and aesthetic enjoyment; an increase in potential safety hazards resulting from the removal of the right-of-way while driving to and from the residences; and obstruction of the view of the lakefront.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver argued he was a sovereign free man who lived in the country by free choice. With respect to the public highways of the country, he had not entered into any contract whereby he had given up his rights as a sovereign free man in exchange for a license and therefore continued to enjoy his rights without interference of police power. The driver also argued he had a right to confront his accuser, who must be a human being, not a corporate body such as the county. The court ruled that the driver had a privilege, but not a right to drive a motor vehicle upon a public highway. To exercise that privilege the driver had to satisfy the licensing requirements of the state, which were not done. Furthermore, when the county prosecuted traffic code violations, it was really the citizens of the county who were the complainants.</SPAN></P>

Because defendant had been convicted previously of another child sexual assault, the circuit court sentenced him to life in prison without parole, as required by Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal defendant asserted a facial substantive due process challenge to &sect; 939.62(2m)(b)2, (c), which required a defendant to be sentenced to life in prison without parole upon a second conviction for a &quot;serious child sex offense.&quot; Under a rationally related test the court found a legislative purpose of protecting children from sexual assault to be a legitimate government interest, and that the lack of legislative findings that sex offenders have high recidivism rates was not fatal, as the legislature could rationally conclude that an individual who had committed two sexual assaults against a child was likely to do so again and unlikely to be rehabilitated. Having found the &quot;two-strikes&quot; provisions constitutional as applied to defendant, the court it did not determine whether a rational basis existed with respect to all of the crimes classified as &quot;serious child sex offenses&quot; under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.62(2m)(a)1m. The court also rejected defendant's equal protection argument, finding that a rational basis existed for imposing &quot;two strike&quot; sentencing on defendants convicted of child sexual assault while providing &quot;three strikes&quot; for defendants convicted of Class A serious felonies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a co-defendant were separately indicted on charges of first degree sexual assault on a child arising from the same episode. Defendant turned himself in, but the co-defendant fled and had not been apprehended at the time defendant filed his motion for substitution of the trial judge. The trial court denied the motion on the ground that Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.20(6) (1999-2000), which governed such requests, required that all defendant's join in the request. Defendant argued that, because the co-defendant was not available to join the request, the court should have treated the two cases as separate and allowed the request. The appellate court held that, although the result might be unfair, the plain language of the statute required that all defendants join the request, even where the defendants were separately indicted. It was not the function of the court to correct an unfair result, only to interpret the statute as it was written, and as long as the result was not unconstitutional, the statute must be interpreted as written.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by failing to dismiss the case, because &sect; 343.44(2g)(c) denied her equal protection of the law. She argued that the statute resulted in her being treated differently from other similarly situated individuals and that there was no rational basis for the inequity. The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant was similarly situated to those who had two prior fine-related OARs and were then charged with a third offense, where the revocation arose out of an operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI) conviction. Defendant did not demonstrate that other individuals who were actually similarly situated were treated differently. The rational basis for the statutory scheme was to punish repeat offenders with progressive harshness to deter future violations. Another overarching basis was to deter alcohol-related offenses and impose more severe punishment for operating after a revocation resulting from an OWI conviction. Because defendant was treated the same as similarly situated individuals, the trial court did not err by denying her motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The officer testified that he personally viewed the sites before issuing the citations. At one site, he observed rusted trailers with some of the doors cracked, at least one trailer without tires, and some without license plates. The only change in the sites from the time he issued the citations until the time of trial was the change in seasons. Further, he testified that since 1996, the number of vehicles had increased. At the other site, the officer testified that before issuing the citations he observed a couple of pickups, a wrecker, a flatbed with steel on it, a jeep, and a couple of cars from an accident. On the date of trial he observed some trucks and some cars there. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal issue on appeal entailed whether Wis. Admin. Code ch. Comm 83 complied with the statutory requirement that all applicable state regulations ensured compliance with Wisconsin's groundwater protection standards, as established by the Department of Natural Resources under Wis. Stat. ch. 160. The court's task, therefore, was to determine whether Wis. Admin. Code ch. Comm 83 contradicted either the language of Wis. Stat. ch. 160 or the legislature's intent in enacting ch. 160. The court examined sundry provisions of ch. 160, with which appellants claimed Wis. Admin. Code ch. Comm 83 failed to comply. The court found no requirement that the statutory standards be incorporated into the text of an agency rule. In looking to the legislature's intent, the court found that express textual incorporation of, or reference to, the numerical standards was not a requirement of Wis. Stat. ch. 160, so long as the rules in question achieved the required results. The court additionally found that Wis. Admin. Code &sect; 83.24 neither conflicted with the express language of Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possessing a controlled substance in the Circuit Court for Iowa County (Wisconsin). Defendant appealed contending that police violated her right against unreasonable searches and seizures when they conducted a canine sniff on her car, entered it, and searched her purse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police executed a search warrant at a duplex. A police officer then checked cars located in that area with a dog trained in detecting the odor of contraband. The dog alerted on defendant's car twice. The officer opened the car door and put the dog inside. When the dog alerted on a purse that was sitting on the driver's seat, the officer took the purse, opened it, and found marijuana inside. Both the car and the purse belonged to defendant. The appellate court examined United States Supreme Court precedent and concluded that current law did not classify canine sniffs as searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Thus, the officer was not required to have probable cause or reasonable suspicion before walking a dog around defendant's vehicle for the purpose of detecting drugs. As to the requirement of probable cause to conduct the search, an automobile and containers therein could be searched without a warrant so long as there is probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime would be found inside. Accordingly, once the dog sniff indicated that defendant's vehicle contained a controlled substance, the officer had probable cause to search both the car and the purse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the circuit court denying defendant's motion to suppress was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The warrantless blood sample was proper, because the blood was drawn to obtain evidence of intoxication from the defendant, who was lawfully arrested for a drunk-driving related crime, there was clear indication that the blood draw would produce evidence of intoxication, the method used was reasonable, and the defendant presented no reasonable objection to the blood draw.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by the State with a statutory forfeiture offense, rather than a misdemeanor, and convicted, after a six-person jury trial, of speeding in excess of 65 miles per hour. Defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction entered in the Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal defendant argued that: (1) the prosecutor was both obligated to respond to his discovery request, and Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.421 was unconstitutional; (2) the destruction of a videotape from the citing officer's car violated the State's duty in civil forfeiture cases to preserve evidence; and (3) he had a constitutional right to a 12-person jury, and Wis. Stat. &sect; 756.06(2)(c), which provided only a 6-person jury, violated both Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, and his equal protection rights. The appellate court rejected each contention, finding inter alia that although the defendant sent a discovery request letter to the district attorney's office, the record failed to show that he ever complied with Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.421 (1999-2000) by making a motion to the court requesting discovery. The court also found no error in the trial court's refusal to sanction that State for the destruction of the videotape, as the highway patrol recorded over the videotape as a routine matter and nothing showed that the State had attempted to affect the outcome of litigation or in a willful disregard for the judicial process, and that defendant did not have a constitutional right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the named beneficiary of a participant in the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS), filed a complaint as a class action alleging unjust enrichment and a taking without just compensation by defendant Department of Employee Trust Funds (DETF). The beneficiary appealed from the dismissal without prejudice by the Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, of her complaint for failure to exhaust her administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The beneficiary, a WRS participant's widow, became entitled upon her husband's death to a lump-sum death benefit which the DETF did not pay for another two years. Her complaint alleged on information and belief that DETF had retained for substantial periods of time the lump-sum death benefits due other beneficiaries after the benefits were distributable, that DETF was unjustly enriched by the time value of the funds during the periods they were retained, and that DETF's retention and use of those funds was an unconstitutional taking under the Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The trial court dismissed the complaint, finding that the exclusive remedy for class members was an appeal to the DETF board and then review of the board's decision by an action for certiorari review in the circuit court, and the motion was granted. The appellate court, however, determined that an appeal to the board was an inadequate remedy, as the board lacked statutory authority to award interest on either an unjust enrichment or a taking claim, and that the beneficiary was not required to exhaust her administrative remedies before filing her complaint on either exhaustion or sovereign immunity grounds.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 940.20(1) (1999-2000), both as a repeater, were multiplicitous under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.66(2m) (1999-2000) and violated the prohibition against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

After denial of his motion asserting the battery charges were multiplicitous and in violation of the prohibition against double jeopardy, defendant entered a plea agreement whereby the State dismissed the kidnapping and false imprisonment charges, and defendant pleaded guilty, as a repeater, to aggravated battery, battery by a prisoner, and threatening to injure. The trial court denied defendant's postconviction motion re-raising the multiplicity and double jeopardy claim, finding the plea agreement had waived the issue. The appellate court determined that the plea agreement did not waive defendant's double jeopardy challenge; that Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.66(2m) (1999-2000) applied to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 940.19, 940.20 (1999-2000), making the charges multiplicitous; and remanded for a determination of the appropriate remedy under the circumstances, taking into consideration both defendant's and the State's interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former client was picked out of a line up by the victim after the victim was sexually assaulted. Hair samples were taken from the scene. The former client hired the attorney to represent him. The attorney did not request a DNA analysis of the hair. The former client was convicted of robbery, burglary, and sexual assault. After serving four years in prison, his conviction was reversed. After the State dropped all charges, the former client sued for legal malpractice. The civil jury found the attorney negligent for both not obtaining the DNA analysis, and for not procuring certain alibi witness testimony. On appeal, the court rejected the attorney's claim that the action sounded in personal injury and was thus untimely filed under Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.54 (1999-2000), holding that the legal malpractice action was governed by Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.53 (1999-2000), a statute allowing six years to bring an action for injury to the character or rights of another. However, the court determined that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury that the former client bore the burden of proving his innocence of the criminal charges in order to prevail on his malpractice claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded with directions to limit the retrial to whether the former client committed the offenses of which he was convicted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver argued that the trial court erred because the threatened sanction of a loss of driving privileges constituted an impermissible coercive measure. The court of appeals disagreed. Driving upon a public highway was a privilege and not an inherent right. When people elected to exercise the privilege of operating a motor vehicle upon a public highway, they had also elected to consent to the taking of a lawfully requested chemical test of their blood alcohol content. By refusing to submit to such testing, thereby effectively withdrawing their consent, they could not be expected to retain that privilege. That was not coercion. Rather, it was simply the result that occurred when one refused to take the lawfully requested test after having initially consented to that condition. Therefore, the trial court correctly rejected the defendant's contention that the Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305 was unconstitutional and properly found that he had refused the lawfully requested chemical test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an adult entertainment establishment, sought review from a summary judgment in favor of respondent town by the Circuit Court for Walworth County (Wisconsin). The judgment permanently enjoined the adult entertainment establishment from operating at its location in the town, because the establishment was operating within 750 feet of a park, in violation of county zoning ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially the town asserted the adult entertainment business was an unpermitted use under a prior ordinance. However, the adult establishment sought approval as a retail establishment under the 2000 county ordinance. The county board held that the establishment qualified as an adult establishment under the applicable county zoning ordinance. On appeal, the adult establishment asserted the town was required to exhaust its administrative remedies by challenging that decision through a timely filed certiorari proceeding. However, the appellate court held the board's determination provided the town with the opportunity to invoke the 750-foot setback requirement as the basis for its injunction claim in its amended complaint. Therefore, the town was not aggrieved by the board's determination, and it had no need to seek certiorari review of the board's determination. In short, the town had no administrative remedy to exhaust. Therefore, the town was entitled to seek injunctive relief from the circuit court via direct action. Finally, the adult establishment did not qualify as a legal nonconforming use, because it never qualified as a valid unspecified use under the prior ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and co-defendant approached a man in his car. Defendant pointed a gun at the man and ordered him out of his car. Defendant told the man to lie on the pavement and look the other way as the two suspects drove away. Defendant pled guilty and was sentenced to 35 years for the armed robbery conviction. Two months later, the same court sentenced the co-defendant to 20 years, after being convicted by a jury for the same charge. The appellate court held defendant's equal protection rights were not violated by the different sentences, as defendant and the co-defendant were not similarly situated. Defendant was previously convicted of two misdemeanors and two felonies and was on probation for felony carjacking. The co-defendant only had three misdemeanor convictions. The difference in the sentences was not a new factor that warranted modification of defendant's sentence. Defendant failed to prove ineffective assistance of counsel due to his attorney's failure to request a specific jail term. As the trial court would not have been bound by the defense counsel's recommendations for a specific term, the failure to do so did not prejudice defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that defendant was attempting to have it declare portions of the implied consent law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305 (1999-2000), unconstitutional. The court rejected defendant's contentions and ruled, because the State had not been given the opportunity to defend the validity of the statute in question, and because the court was therefore deprived of the opportunity to analyze questions of constitutional dimension from a perspective that was not limited to the narrow interests and views of the private parties to the action, it declined to take up defendant's constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court declined to hold the present case until the supreme court issued its opinion in a case involving an objection to a blood test based on a fear of needles. The supreme court would be examining whether a blood draw survived the test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment when the suspect expressed a fear of needles and asked for a breath test rather than a blood draw.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner filed a declaratory relief action against the respondent village, seeking a declaration that DeForest, Wis. Municipal Code &sect; 11.08(3), the non-emergency nuisance abatement ordinance, was unconstitutional. The Circuit Court, Dane County (Wisconsin) dismissed the action and assessed attorney fees against her for pursuing a frivolous action. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the village's non-emergency nuisance abatement ordinance, the village issued several orders requiring the property owner to remove noxious weeds from her property. On appeal, the owner contended, inter alia, that the trial court ignored disputes of material fact, erred by holding the ordinance constitutional, erred by holding the action frivolous and awarding $ 300 in fees. The appellate court affirmed. The case was properly dismissed, as there were no disputed material facts. The issue on the action was whether the ordinance provided due process to a person subject to an abatement order. Prior precedential case law found a similarly written ordinance constitutional, and that case was binding on the trial court. Moreover, the owner's arguments were limited to factual issues that were irrelevant in determining whether the ordinance provided due process. The court further found that the award of attorney fees was not unreasonable, as the record showed that the defendant had substantial equity in her house and income that exceeded her expenses. Additionally, the owner failed to show that the $ 300 exceeded the limits of reasonableness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged sexual assault occurred when the officer, pursuant to a traffic stop, stopped the driver's vehicle. The driver argued that the trial court erred in concluding that the scope-of-employment issue she raised was appropriate for determination by summary judgment rather than by submission to a jury, and she argued that the trial court erred in dismissing her additional claim that the city violated her civil rights. The appellate court ruled that the circuit court correctly determined that the officer's assault of the driver was outside the scope of his employment. Defendant argued that the question of how much an employee deviated from the employer's purpose before the employee was no longer within the scope of his employment was one of degrees. The appellate court determined that, although it accepted the driver's theoretical premise that the question was one of degrees, it rejected her contention that the officer's assaultive behavior was linked to some service of the city. Furthermore, although the officer encountered the driver while working, his assault of her was, unquestionably, not actuated by an intent to serve his employer, the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After failing field sobriety tests administered by the officer, defendant was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. Defendant submitted to a blood draw after being read the &quot;informing the accused&quot; form. A warrantless draw of defendant's blood was taken at a hospital, and an analysis of the blood sample revealed a blood alcohol content of .269. Defendant argued that analysis of the blood draw was a separate search requiring a warrant. The court ruled that the seizure of blood was permitted without a warrant under the exigent circumstances exception and the analysis of the legally seized blood was not a separate search for Fourth Amendment purposes. Because the State was authorized to analyze defendant's blood with or without his consent, the court did not address defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the implied consent law.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff, a plan participant, sued the negligent driver and defendant-appellant, the driver's liability insurer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's employer maintained a self-insured health benefits plan for its employees under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1001 et seq. Under the plan, the claims administrator was empowered to initially determine the entitlement of participants to receive benefits. The committee, which acted as the plan administrator and appointed the claims administrator, had the power to construe and interpret the plan, to determine all questions arising under the plan, and to hear and decide appeals from determinations of the Claims Administrator as to participant's rights to benefits under the plan. The plan administrator determined it was entitled to subrogation. The trial court agreed, and, by declaratory judgment, ordered the negligent driver's liability insurer to reimburse the employer for the medical expenses it paid. On appeal, the insurer contended subrogation was not appropriate under the state's &quot;make whole&quot; doctrine. The court disagreed, concluding that the plan administrator's determination was due substantial deference, and that the plan administrator did not act unreasonably in asserting its right to subrogation under its plan language.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 48.415(4) (1999-2000). The Circuit Court for Walworth County, Wisconsin, terminated the mother's parental rights, and the mother sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court took judicial notice of the facts that the mother was denied periods of physical placement or visitation by court order, and, at least one year had elapsed since the court order denying periods of physical placement or visitation was issued. The mother's defense was that a condition precedent to the child's return to the mother's home was that visitation between mother and child be approved by the child's therapist, was impossible to fulfill because the child was not in therapy for part of the period she was placed outside of the mother's home. The appellate court found that: (1) Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.427 (1999-2000) provided sufficient safeguards to protect Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(4) (1999-2000) from a constitutional challenge; (2) the circuit court did not err in taking judicial notice of the facts because the mother's defense did not challenge the facts judicially noticed; and (3) the court of appeals lacked subject matter jurisdiction to overrule, modify or withdraw language from one of its published opinions.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to the agreement, defendant pleaded no contest to the reduced charge, reserving his right to appeal whether he should be able to present a mistake-of-age defense. The State acknowledged that, as part of the plea bargain, defendant retained his right to appeal the issue. The circuit court indicated that defendant would not be allowed to raise the mistake-of-age defense at trial and accepted defendant's no contest plea. The appellate court ruled that defendant could not enter a no contest plea and then pursue a mistake-of-age defense on appeal; however, defendant should have the opportunity to withdraw his plea. Because defendant pleaded no contest with the erroneous understanding that he could challenge the evidentiary issue on appeal, his plea was not knowing and voluntary as a matter of law. Furthermore, because the State did not keep its promise that was an inducement for the plea, due process was violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from an order requiring it to return two guns to defendant who pled no contest to one count of disorderly conduct, a Class B misdemeanor. The Circuit Court for Eau Claire County, Wisconsin, found that forfeiture of the guns under Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.20(1m)(b) (1999-2000) was unconstitutional under the Excessive Fines Clause, U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two guns were seized from defendant after neighbors reported that he fired the guns toward their property. At issue was whether the nonreturn of weapons used in the commission of a crime, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.20(1m)(b) (1999-2000), constituted a forfeiture subject to the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment. The guns were valued between $ 5,000 and $ 7,150, and the maximum fine for disorderly conduct was $ 1,000. The State argued that the Excessive Fines Clause was inapplicable. The appellate court found that: (1) Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.20(1m)(b) (1999-2000), prescribed a forfeiture that violated the Excessive Fines Clause because the forfeiture was partially a punishment; (2) the forfeiture of the guns was grossly disproportionate to the maximum penalty for the crime and thus was unconstitutional under the Excessive Fines Clause; (3) the State failed to argue the factors to show that the Excessive Fines Clause was not violated; and (4) arguments not refuted were deemed admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner grandmother filed a motion to compel respondent mother to comply with a 1996 stipulated visitation order. The mother filed a motion to modify the stipulation, seeking in actuality to vacate the stipulation. The circuit court for Juneau County, Wisconsin, vacated the prior order that established visitation rights on behalf of the grandmother. The guardian ad litem appealed on behalf of the minor child and the grandmother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor child was a nonmarital child who had not been adopted and whose paternity had been established. The mother had sole custody of the child. The grandmother was seeking to maintain visitation rights with the minor whose mother opposed the visitation. The guardian ad litem determined that it was in the minor's best interest to maintain visitation with his grandmother. The circuit court concluded that as a fit parent, the mother had the right to make decisions concerning the best interest of her child and the circuit court could not interfere with her decision regarding visitation. The appellate court found that: (1) nothing in Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.245 (1997-98) required a showing of parental unfitness before a circuit court could override a parent's decision regarding grandparent visitation, nor was there any Wisconsin case law holding as much; (2) due process required that circuit courts applied a presumption that a fit parent's decision regarding non-parental visitation was in the best interest of the child; and (3) a circuit court could read this requirement into a non-parental visitation statute, even when the statute was silent on the topic.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court applied an erroneous legal standard and the matter was reversed and remanded with directions that the circuit court should reconsider the grandmother's request for visitation under Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.245(3) (1997-98), giving presumptive weight to the mother's decision regarding non-parental visitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Milwaukee County Circuit Court (Wisconsin), which convicted him of knowingly violating a domestic abuse injunction, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 813.12(8)(a) (1999-2000), disorderly conduct while armed, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 947.01 and 939.63 (1999-2000), and second degree recklessly endangering safety, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.30(2) (1999-2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that, among other things, the trial court erred in reinstructing the jury on the charge of second degree recklessly endangering safety, in response to the jury's request. The court concluded that the trial court properly reinstructed the jury on the charge of second degree recklessly endangering safety. The trial court's responses to the jury's questions did not prejudice defendant. The court agreed with defendant that defense counsel's statement to the jury conceding defendant's guilt to the charge of disorderly conduct while armed was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea and that defense counsel lacked the power to offer such a &quot;plea&quot; without defendant's consent. Defense counsel was ineffective, and defendant was entitled to a new trial on the &quot;while armed&quot; portion of the disorderly conduct charge. Because the trial court erroneously admitted under the public records hearsay exception certain documents which were not made under oath or attested to in any way, defendant was entitled to a new trial on the charge of violating a domestic abuse injunction. The trial court also erred in assessing costs against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the second degree recklessly endangering safety conviction. However, the court reversed the &quot;while armed&quot; portion of the judgment finding him guilty of disorderly conduct, as well as the judgment for knowingly violating a domestic abuse injunction, and it remanded those charges with directions to the trial court. The court also vacated that portion of the judgment assessing costs against defendant.</SPAN></P>

He also appealed from an order denying his postconviction motion. Defendant claimed in part that the trial court should have granted his motion to suppress his first statement to police and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police questioned defendant about a homicide and defendant denied any knowledge of the matter. The police then noticed blood on defendant's clothing, terminated the questioning, and read defendant his Miranda warnings. Subsequently, defendant gave a second statement in which he indicated he shot the victim in self-defense. Defendant moved to suppress the first statement and did not testify at trial, as his counsel was concerned that his testifying would expose defendant to his initial cover-up of the crime. On appeal, the appellate court: (1) held the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress because defendant's initial interview was not an interrogation; (2) rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony about a gun other than the murder weapon that defendant alleged the victim threatened him with, but that was found near the murder weapon in another house; and (3) held defendant's counsel was not ineffective in failing to have defendant testify at the suppression hearing or in failing to suppress defendant's post-Miranda statements, as defendant's postconviction offers of proof on the matters were wholly inadequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court rejected defendant's challenges to the postconviction court's rulings, and defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During dinner at the hospital cafeteria, the nurse told a psychiatric in-patient that the psychiatric unit patients were receiving electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) without their consent, gave her an information sheet on ECT, and asked her to distribute it on the unit. The nurse further stated that staff personnel eavesdropped on patients and asked her to attend a protest rally in front of the hospital. The court ruled that the board reasonably interpreted Wis. Admin. Code &sect; N 7.04 as covering the nurse's conduct and that the provision was not unconstitutionally vague, as applied to the nurse. Also, testimony that a consensus in the field deemed it misconduct and below minimum standards to become friends with former patients, contact, or socialize with them, or communicate personal information to them for other than therapeutic reasons, provided substantial evidence that a consensus of experts would agree that the nurse committed professional misconduct. Furthermore, the court rejected the proposition that the First Amendment protected licensed professionals from meeting minimal professional standards, even if the professional violated those standards by speech.</SPAN></P>

A detective told defendant to come in and conducted a pat-down search of defendant, which revealed marijuana. On appeal, the appellate court rejected defendant's argument that the pat-down was unlawful because the search warrant only authorized a search for evidence of the crime of possession of controlled substances, not for the more serious offense of possession of controlled substances with intent to deliver; thus, the pat-down search was unwarranted. The appellate court noted that pat-down searches were justified when an officer had reasonable suspicion that a suspect may have been armed, with the determination of reasonableness made in light of the totality of the circumstances. In this case, the officer who conducted the search had many years of experience and testified that in his opinion it was common to search any person present for weapons.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance company sought review of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County's (Wisconsin) order granting respondent insured's motion for declaratory judgment that the insured's automobile insurance policy's antistacking provision was ambiguous and did not preclude payment under the policy's uninsured motor vehicle provision, even though payment had been made under the uninsured motor vehicle provision of defendant ex-wife's policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured's daughter was killed in an auto accident while riding as a passenger in an uninsured vehicle. The insured and his ex-wife each had a car insured with the insurance company, and each the policies provided $ 50,000 uninsured motor vehicle coverage per person, and each included an antistacking provision. Thus, the insurance company paid the insured and his ex-wife the $ 50,000 policy limit, but denied the insured's claim for an additional $ 50,000 payment. On appeal, the appellate court rejected the trial court's decision and the argument of the insured that the antistacking provision of his policy was inapplicable to the case. The appellate court noted the antistacking clause tracked verbatim the language of Wis. Stat. &sect; 632.32(5)(f) (1999-2000), which authorized such provisions. The appellate court also rejected the insured's argument that &sect; 632.32(5)(f), as applied to the circumstances of the case, was unconstitutional under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, holding that the insured failed to establish any deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction entered in the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin), for kidnapping and attempted first-degree sexual assault with the use of a dangerous weapon, as a habitual criminal, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.62(2) (1999-2000). Defendant additionally appealed his life sentence pursuant to the persistent repeater statute, or three strikes law, and the trial court's order denying his motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant induced the victim to enter an apartment through a false story and attempted to sexually assault her. On appeal, the appellate court rejected defendant's argument that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction of kidnapping. Specifically, he contended there was insufficient evidence at trial to satisfy the &quot;confinement&quot; element of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.31(1)(b) (1999-2000). The appellate court held that the definition of &quot;confinement,&quot; as set forth in Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.30 (1999-2000), the false imprisonment statute, and in Wis. Jury Instruction Crim. No. 1275, was appropriate in a case of kidnapping. The appellate court also concluded that a reasonable jury could find that defendant confined the victim by depriving her of her freedom of movement and compelling her to remain where she did not wish to remain. The appellate court also rejected defendant's challenge to the &quot;three strikes&quot; law for persistent repeaters who had committed felonies, and defendant's argument that the trial court erroneously relied upon an Alabama conviction of assault with intent to murder because the Alabama statute was comparable to Wisconsin's attempted homicide statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a routine traffic stop, an officer noticed a roach in the ashtray of defendant's car. The officer searched the car and defendant and found other drugs. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the drug evidence asserting that the officer had no probable cause to continue the traffic stop. The Circuit Court for St. Croix County (Wisconsin) denied the motion and defendant was found guilty of several drug offenses. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court agreed with the trial court's ruling on the motion to suppress and held that there was probable cause to stop defendant and reasonable suspicion to continue the traffic stop. There was also probable cause to arrest defendant and search his car. Defendant seemed to argue that the officer improperly expanded the scope of the traffic stop when he asked defendant to pass the ashtray to him. The trial court found, and the evidence supported, a traffic stop supported by probable cause. The officer testified that he saw a roach in the ashtray. He indicated, in essence, that he was familiar with roaches and knew them to usually contain marijuana. The contraband was in defendant's vehicle and in an area within his immediate access. Those circumstances combined to support probable cause to arrest defendant for possession of marijuana. The ensuing search for and seizure of controlled substances were incident to defendant's lawful arrest. The appellate court further agreed that the charges were not multiplicitous under the standards for determining double jeopardy challenges. A presumption therefore existed that the legislature intended to permit cumulative punishments.</SPAN></P>

Defendant consented to the taking of a blood sample, and the test results showed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.257 percent. Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress the blood test results, contending that even if the initial seizure of his blood sample without a warrant was lawful, the subsequent analysis of the blood sample required a warrant, as there were neither exceptions to the warrant requirement nor exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless analysis of his blood. The court determined that defendant was not permitted to parse the lawful seizure of his blood sample into multiple components, each to be given independent significance for purposes of the warrant requirement. The court ruled that because the testing of the blood sample was not a separate event from the seizure of the sample, the court did not need to address defendant's contention that his consent under the implied consent law did not extend to the subsequent testing of the lawfully seized sample.</SPAN></P>

The patient argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by dismissing his claim for failure to request mediation. The court of appeals disagreed.

The trial court noted that at the time of the hearing on the hospital's motion to dismiss, the patient had still not filed a mediation request. Further, he did not file a brief in response to the motion to dismiss but requested at the hearing that the trial court send the parties to mediation in lieu of dismissal. The trial court recognized that the purpose of mediation was to avoid expenses and intimated that the patient's failure to request mediation had already resulted in great expense to the hospital.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions entered in the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin) for false imprisonment, kidnapping, battery, and three counts of second-degree sexual assault arguing that his constitutional speedy trial and due process rights were violated by the six-year delay in charging him. He further argued that he was entitled to a new trial in the interests of justice and pursuant to the &quot;plain error&quot; doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1990 defendant was convicted of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated criminal sexual assault. Defendant appealed those convictions and in 1994, the aggravated criminal sexual assault charge carrying a 60 year sentence was reversed and vacated. In 1997 a criminal complaint was filed and a warrant issued charging defendant with the offenses in the instant case in connection with the same crime for which his conviction for aggravated sexual assault had been vacated. Defendant argued that the six year lapse violated his right to speedy trial. The appellate court noted that the Sixth Amendment speedy trial right could not be violated by a prearrest delay in charging and its protection was triggered only when a criminal prosecution had begun. Moreover, defendant's speedy trial right attached only when the complaint and warrant on new and different charges was issued in 1997. Further, while defendant's due process rights may have been implicated by the precharging delay, he failed to allege or prove actual prejudice or improper motive for the delay. Finally, the evidentiary rule of &quot;plain error&quot; was inapplicable to an alleged constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parent appealed the termination of his parental rights on three grounds: (1) that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(4) (1999-2000) violated his substantive due process rights; (2) that the trial court erred by not making its egregiousness determination in light of a recent appellate decision; and (3) the trial court lost competency to issue a dispositional order when it failed to do so within ten days of taking evidence relating to the disposition. The appellate court held the parent waived his constitutional challenge because the issue was not raised at trial. The appellate court refrained from requiring retrospective application of the recent appellate decision to the parent's case, as it would thrust an excessive burden on the administration of justice. Also, the trial court's determination of the egregious nature of the parent's treatment of his children (including leaving them outside in the cold without clothing and placing them in a dog cage in an unheated basement) was well documented in the record. Finally, as the trial court's delay in issuing its order did not affect the parent's right to timely appeal or the children's stability, the delay did not require a reversal.</SPAN></P>

The town had statutory authority to develop the subdivision under the general powers granted to a village in Wis. Stat. &sect; 61.34(1), (3), and (5) (1999-2000). Nothing prevented the town from assuming the dual role of subdivider and reviewer of a proposed plat. The town's actions were not prohibited by the public purpose doctrine.

They also claimed that the changes should not be applied to them because the petitions alleging that they were sexually violent persons subject to ch. 980 commitment were filed before the effective date of the changes. They argued, inter alia, that the automatic commitment provision in Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.06 (1999-2000), and the 18 month waiting period in Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.08(1) (1999-2000) violated their rights to equal protection because they were treated more harshly than were similarly situated persons committed under Wis. Stat. ch. 51 (1999-2000). The court of appeals disagreed. Although Wis. Stat. ch. 51 (1999-2000) was more &quot;lenient&quot; than was Wis. Stat. ch. 980 (1999-2000) the differences between the degree of danger posed by each of the two classes of persons, as well as the differences in what must be proven in order to commit under the two chapters, justified on a strict-scrutiny analysis the disparate, but narrowly tailored, procedures about which the defendants complained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant complained that: (1) she was denied her constitutional right to confront the witnesses against her; (2) her trial counsel was ineffective; (3) the search warrant affidavit was insufficient to support a finding of probable cause; and (4) the search warrant did not authorize the seizure of two safes from her residence. The appellate court concluded that allowing the testimony of two witnesses who had testified at the preliminary hearing but were unavailable at trial, even if error, was not prejudicial because the evidence was duplicative. It held that defendant had failed to establish that she was prejudiced by counsel's decisions not to call an insurance adjuster and not to cross examine a witness about an immunity agreement she had with the state. The court concluded that the search warrant affidavit set forth sufficient facts to support a finding of probable cause, even absent the paragraph which failed to establish the police detective's basis for his knowledge of insurance coverage. Finally, the police were justified in seizing the safes pursuant to the warrant because they were plausible repositories for financial records, located on the named premise.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the defendant challenged the trial court's dismissal of his motions to suppress evidence of his blood alcohol content. The defendant argued that the seizure of his blood was unconstitutional because Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305 violated U.S. Const. amend IV. The appellate court found that the defendant failed to properly notify the attorney general of his constitutional challenge, and therefore did not preserve the issue for review.  Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.04(11) required that when a constitutional challenge to a statute was made, the attorney general must be served with a copy of the proceeding and be entitled to be heard. Failure to do so precluded the defendant from challenging the validity of the statute. The defendant moved to supplement the record with a copy of a letter to the attorney general sent when he filed his trial motions. The court denied the motion to supplement the record, and held that his constitutional challenged was waived even if the motion would have been granted, because none of the trial motions to suppress would have notified the attorney general that the defendant was asserting the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellee city sought an injunction against the appellant prostitutes in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) enjoining them from prostitution related activities in the city.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held as an initial finding that the trial court had the authority to issue an injunction to abate the prostitute's role in what the undisputed evidentiary submissions proved was a public nuisance. The prostitutes argued, inter alia, that: (1) the parts of the injunction that prohibited loitering in the doorways of the private property of others was unconstitutionally vague; and (2) the parts of the injunction that imposed a twenty-five foot no-intrusion radius from any other person who might have been violating any provisions of the injunction were unconstitutionally vague. The court of appeals held that: (1) there was nothing vague about the injunction's prohibition against loitering in doorways, or sitting on private residential property without the permission of the property owner; the prohibitions were clear and easy to obey; and (2) that provision did not give the prostitutes fair warning of prohibited conduct, there was nothing in the record that indicated that any of the prostitutes were sufficiently familiar with all those subject to the injunction so that compliance with this provision would not have been a haphazard, guessing adventure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injunction was affirmed as to all provisions except those enjoining the prostitutes from being within 25 feet of other prostitutes, and from associating with passersby, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife had no assets, and therefore, the creditor sought wage garnishment against the husband. The husband argued that his wages should be exempt from garnishment because he and his wife had a marital property agreement that classified his wages as individual property. Since the husband's wages were classified as individual property, he claimed that they could not be used to satisfy a judgment against his wife. The creditor asserted that the marital agreement was not binding in this case because it had no notice of the agreement. The court agreed with the creditor, and determined that since the creditor had no notice of the agreement, the marital property agreement was not binding. The husband also argued that the garnishment violated several of his constitutional rights, however, the court refused to make such a finding.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that the trial court erred when it refused to grant his motion for mistrial based on a dissenting juror. The appellate court held that the trial court properly denied the mistrial motion because: (1) the verdict was received in open court and announced, but polling had not been completed and judgment had not been entered, so the verdict had not been accepted by the trial court when the dissenting juror spoke; and (2) the individual voir dire was recorded and consisted solely of the trial court asking the juror whether she voted guilty back in the deliberation room.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the guilty-plea-waiver rule did not apply because his constitutional challenges focused on the authority, capacity, power, and right by which the lower court compelled him to come before it and whether the trial court could hear and determine the controversy and pronounce sentence. The appellate court concluded that the guilty-plea-waiver rule applied because: (1) defendant could not avoid the guilty-plea-waiver rule by entering a &quot;conditional plea&quot; and reserving the right to appeal; (2) defendant's challenge to the application of the statute did not call into question the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court; (3) despite the labels defendant attached to the issues, he did not challenge the ability of respondent State to convict him of OWI-he only challenged the ability of the State to seek the imposition of criminal penalties; (4) defendant's guilty plea was voluntary and intelligent; and (5) the appellate court declined to exercise its discretion and relieve defendant of the effect of the guilty-plea-waiver rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued that his guilty plea was involuntary.

The court of appeals further held that if the trial court found that the defendant entered his plea believing he could appeal the trial court ruling on the State's motion in limine, and that he would have insisted upon a trial had he not been misinformed, then he had to be afforded the opportunity to withdraw his plea and have a trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the State failed to prove he was within 90 days of release when the petition of commitment was filed. The State was required to prove that element, and that a remand for an evidentiary hearing would not violate defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy. Defendant argued that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 980.01(7), 980.02(2)(c) (1999-2000), were unconstitutional because they were vague as applied. Defendant did not offer any case law that supported a change in the usual procedure for creating jury instructions. The appellate court declined to remove the burden of requesting the instruction from the party who would benefit from it. A reasonable attorney, comparing the statutory term and the judicial definition, could conclude that the judicial definition would not make a significant difference in the outcome. The exclusion of testimony of one of defendant's experts was harmless. The partial answer was not stricken; the probative value of the parole discussion was modest, because parole supervision would presumably end at some point. Defendant's substantial rights were not affected by the trial court denying his request to strike a juror for cause.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed the State to read into evidence a witness's prior testimony under Wis. Stat. &sect; 908.045(1) (1999-2000). The witness persistently refused to answer questions, and defendant's confrontation rights were not violated. The trial court instructed the jury that a dangerous weapon meant a baseball bat. Defendant approved of the instruction. Trial counsel's failure to object to the instruction was not prejudicial as there was no reasonable probability that the jurors would not have found the baseball bat to be a dangerous weapon.</SPAN></P>

Defendant consented to a search of his person and police found a plastic baggie containing a 40-gram chunk of cocaine. The evidence differed on what exactly hung from the rear view mirror, but there was no conflict that something did. The appellate court found that: (1) defendant failed to show prejudice from ineffective assistance of counsel because the trial court's decision to deny the motion to suppress could not have been changed; (2) the exclusion of the testimony of the driver was error, but it was harmless error because of the overwhelming evidence of guilt; and (3) the convictions did not violate double jeopardy because possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver was not a lesser-included offense of a tax stamp violation.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held that: (1) he offered no support for his assertion that the same people would have applied for and received the licenses even without the ordinances, yet, it was his burden to provide such proof; a bald assertion such as was made was insufficient to demonstrate that it was clear that no public purpose would be served; and (2) the regulations controlling the application for a reserve class B liquor license were inextricably tied to the application for the economic development grant and provided sufficient control and accountability to ensure that the public purposes outlined in the ordinances had a reasonable probability of being met.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Walworth County, Wisconsin, of one count of sexual contact with a child, as a persistent repeat offender, and one count of repeated acts of sexual contact with a child. The prior offense used to establish his repeat offender status was under the statute of another state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court concluded that counsel's failure to object to: the reading of a transcript of an interview that defendant had with the police; a comment made by the prosecutor about defense objections to &quot;other acts &quot; evidence; and to prosecutor's closing argument, were reasonable trial strategy and did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. It held that, although the prosecutor's closing remarks suggested to the jury that, if it did not convict the defendant he would assault an other child, the remarks, though offensive, did not violate the defendant's right to a fair trial. It noted that the Wisconsin Supreme Court recently decided that under similar circumstance the repeat offender statute was constitutional. Finally, the appellate court held that the repeat offender penalty enhancer was properly applied based on a conviction under a comparable statute from another state. The foreign statute penalized sexual contact with a person who was 16 years old, while Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02(2) (1999-2000) did not.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held that the dissipation of alcohol from a person's blood stream constituted a sufficient exigency to justify a forcible, warrantless blood draw. Therefore, the defendant's request for the less invasive breath test and the availability of such a test did not deprive the officer of his authority to obtain a blood sample from the defendant.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that defendant did not meet his burden of proof on either claim because: (1) defendant failed to prove that his counsel's alleged deficient performance in failing to object to a six-person jury prejudiced him; and (2) the failure to object to the admission of the co-defendant's inculpatory statement was reasonable trial strategy as it was reasonable to believe that the jury might have exonerated defendant after hearing that another person confessed to the crime.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no constitutional right to a jury trial in case involving municipal ordinances. Defendant had a statutory right to a jury trial under &sect; 756.06(2)(c), which only provided for a six-person jury. Because defendant had a six-person jury, the court stated that he had nothing to complain about in this regard.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purpose of the sale was to promote the rehabilitation of the downtown area.

The taxpayers made no claims of fraud. The appellate court found that: (1) the city established that the sale of the parking lot served the legitimate public purpose of revitalizing the downtown area, (2) the city did not misuse its discretion because the private citizen's obligations and the benefits flowing to the city sufficed for consideration, and (3) taxpayers waived their other issues on appeal by not raising them sufficiently in the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Milwaukee County Circuit Court (Wisconsin), which convicted defendant, pursuant to a guilty plea, of keeping or maintaining a drug house, in violation of Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that: (1) she did not voluntarily consent to the warrantless entry into and subsequent search of her home by police, and the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress the evidence seized from the house; (2) &sect; 961.42 was unconstitutionally vague, ambiguous, and overbroad; and (3) the complaint did not set forth sufficient facts to support defendant's guilty plea. The instant court concluded that the record supported the trial court's determination that defendant voluntarily consented to both the officers' entry into and subsequent search of her residence, and that her consent was not the result of police coercion. While defendant reluctantly consented to the entry into her home, she did not specifically identify what was said or done by the officers to constitute illegal police coercion in connection with the entry.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner appealed an order of the Dodge County Circuit Court (Wisconsin), which dismissed his petition for writ of certiorari challenging the revocation of his parole as untimely filed under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prisoner argued that the PLRA violated his right to equal protection because it required prisoners in Wisconsin to file petitions for certiorari review within 45 days, but did not require those incarcerated outside of Wisconsin to file within this truncated deadline. Prisoner also contended that the PLRA violated his right to substantive due process. The instant court rejected prisoner's arguments. Regarding equal protection, there was a rational basis for distinguishing between in-state and out-of-state prisoners for purposes of filing deadlines under the PLRA. In-state and out-of-state prisoners were not identically situated because out-of-state prisoners needed more time than in-state prisoners to prepare legal documents. Regarding substantive due process, the instant court noted that the purpose of the PLRA was to restrict frivolous lawsuits and to limit broadly prisoner litigation at taxpayers' expense. The abbreviated deadlines of the PLRA had a reasonable and rational relationship to the goal of limiting prisoner litigation. Thus, the PLRA's filing deadlines did not violate prisoner's right to substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that &sect; 943.201(2), as applied in the case, represented an unconstitutional ex post facto law.

Defendant had obtained money in the form of wages as the result of his unauthorized use of another's personal identifying information. This constituted a thing of value within the meaning of &sect; 943.201(2). Also, &sect; 943.201(2) created a continuing offense. Thus, since defendant's identity theft allowed him to obtain wages after the effective date of &sect; 943.201(2), the application of the statute did not violate constitutional ex post facto provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The search of defendant's property which revealed the incriminating evidence took place pursuant to a search warrant authorizing a search of the property for evidence in the cases of four apparent child murders.

Defendant also alleged that the multiple counts were multiplicitous and, therefore, that his convictions violated his double jeopardy rights. Defendant's convictions were affirmed. The affidavit related both direct and circumstantial evidence which provided solid support for the search of defendant's property. Also, the affiant's research, expertise, and reasonable inferences provided substantial support for the probable cause determination that, despite the passage of many years between the deaths and the search warrant, evidence of the apparent murders remained at defendant's residence. The multiple counts were different in fact and the legislature, via &sect; 948.12, intended to allow multiple punishments for multiple offenses of possession of child pornography, such that the multiple counts were not multiplicitous.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court reversed the taxing authority's order finding that the tax assessment was void ab initio and that the time limitations in Wis.

The appellate court found that: (1) taxpayer's refund claim was untimely because it was not made within the required two-year period, (2) the legislature made compliance with the statute of limitations mandatory, because it was the only method for the filing and review of claims for tax refunds, and (3) the circuit court improperly reversed the taxing authority's ruling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the appellant claimed that because a breath test was available, the police blood test of him was an unreasonable search and seizure. The court rejected the appellant's contentions. It was uncontested that the blood draw was taken to obtain evidence of intoxication from the appellant, who was lawfully arrested for a drunk driving-related violation. There was also a clear indication that the blood draw would produce evidence of intoxication, based upon the appellant's inability to control his automobile, his stumbling and inability to walk, his strong odor of intoxicants, his admission of alcohol consumption, and his extremely slurred speech. It was uncontested that the blood draw was done in a reasonable manner and that the appellant consented to having blood drawn without objection. Accordingly, the court concluded that the blood draw at issue in this case was not a violation of the appellant's Fourth Amendment rights, and therefore affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bus company filed a summary judgment motion seeking dismissal of appellee passenger and her spouse's negligence suit because it was not commenced within six-months of the date the bus company denied the passenger's claim, as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80(1g). It sought review of the order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, that denied its motion because it found &sect; 893.80(1g) to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passenger's attorney sent the bus company a notice of injury and claim for damages arising out of an accident. The company sent a notice disallowing the claim. The passenger and her spouse sued the company over 10 months after the company's notice was served. It sought summary judgment because suit was not filed within six months of the date of its notice under Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80(1g). The trial court denied the motion, finding that &sect; 893.80(1g) violated the Equal Protection Clause by providing different time limits for those whose claims were disallowed and those claims were not. The company appealed; the appellate court reversed. As there was a rational basis for the statute's different time limitations, which afforded governmental bodies an opportunity to investigate, evaluate, and settle claims, the statute did not violate equal protection. Though the notice stated the deadline was six months from the date of the notice, rather than from the date of service, this error did not mislead the passenger, who missed both dates, or did the notice have to be served on the passenger's attorney, as the statute did not require this, or on her spouse, as his claim was derivative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the appellant contended that the trial court erred in finding him guilty because the police officer did not warn him that lying to the officer could result in criminal charges.

The appellant did not contest that the prosecution proved the elements established in Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.41(1) (1999-2000). Instead, he sought to add another element to the crime: that an officer must warn in advance that lying to police could result in criminal charges. Furthermore, even in the unlikely event that the appellant did not know that lying to police was criminally punishable, his ignorance did not afford him a defense.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals affirmed, first electing not to consider the constitutional challenge, because it had not been timely raised for consideration by the trial court, and because by pleading guilty, appellant waived the right to raise such a defense. The court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in retaining jurisdiction over appellant, and properly determined that the adult facilities would be better able to provide confinement and treatment more suitable to appellant's needs while protecting the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate received the full $ 100,000 limits of the car insurance policy, and sought to collect the $ 50,000 limits in decedent's uninsured motorist policy. The estate argued that the uninsured motorist policy was ambiguous and illusory because it had not fulfilled its promise of mandatory coverage. The appellate court held that the inquiry whether the policy was illusory was unnecessary because: (1) the antistacking clause contained in the policy tracked verbatim the language of Wis. Stat. &sect; 632.32(5)(f) (1999-2000) which authorized such provisions; and (2) the court did not find that the antistacking clause, when read together with the rest of the policy, was susceptible to more than one construction. The court determined that the order of summary judgment was proper because the estate already received a $ 100,000 payment from the car insurer which was $ 50,000 more than the maximum coverage allowed under the uninsured motorist policy, and application of the antistacking clause resulted in the estate receiving the highest coverage available under any single policy, which was exactly what the contract promised to do.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the sentences that he received following his guilty pleas to operating a vehicle while intoxicated, second and third offenses.

The appellate court reversed and remanded for resentencing on both offenses. Before a judgment of conviction could have properly been used to justify an operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated penalty enhancer, the offender had to have been sentenced. Because, at the time of sentencing, defendant had not previously been sentenced for his second offense, the trial court erred in sentencing defendant as a third offender for his second offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, defendant refused to provide a sample of his breath, blood, or urine. The trial court subsequently issued an order revoking defendant's operating privileges due to his actions. Defendant appealed the trial court's order, contending that the applicable statutory provisions, Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(2), (9), and (10) (1999-2000), were unconstitutional because a motor vehicle driver had a constitutional right to refuse consent to a breath, blood, or urine test, and he was being punished for exercising that right. The appellate court affirmed. Defendant failed to show that he raised that issue in the trial court, such that defendant had waived the issue and the appellate court declined to address it. Also, it was necessary for defendant to have notified the attorney general prior to attacking the constitutionality of these statutory provisions. Defendant failed to show in the record that he met that requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated as a third-time offender. He was originally charged as a second-time offender. However, the complaint was later amended to allege a third offense because appellant was convicted of a second operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated offense while this action was awaiting trial. Appellant alleged on appeal that this amendment violated his due process right to adequate notice of the charge, exposed him to ex post facto punishment, and violated his equal protection rights. The court of appeals affirmed. Procedurally, contrary to what the State alleged, appellant did have standing to raise his appellate issues. On the merits, appellant was properly held to know that he was in peril of prosecution in this case as a third-time offender under the reduced prima facie levels set out in the statutes. Fundamental fairness notions were not violated. Nor did the amendment subject appellant to unconstitutional ex post facto punishment. Further, the statutory penalty classifications were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with burglary. He was found in a woman's bedroom closet, dressed in her clothes and armed with knives. Competency exams were ordered when defendant pled not guilty by reason of mental disease. When two psychiatrists found defendant was legally sane at the time of the crime, he pled guilty. The psychiatrists' findings were used at sentencing to establish defendant's future dangerousness. Upon denial of defendant's motion to modify his sentence, he appealed, arguing his constitutional rights were violated. The appellate court disagreed. It was within the scope of competency hearings to draw conclusions concerning defendant's future dangerousness. Additionally, defendant waived his constitutional rights when, through counsel, he placed his mental condition into controversy by pleading not guilty by reason of mental defect. Defendant was reasonably put on notice that the clinical impressions of both doctors would be highly relevant to the issue of future dangerousness, a legitimate sentencing consideration; thus, using pretrial psychiatric reports at the sentencing did not violate defendant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

Innertube rental businesses such as plaintiff business's did not have a justifiable expectation of privacy in areas open to the public.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was adjudicated delinquent and placed under the supervision of respondent State. After violating his supervision, appellant was given a one-year placement at a correctional facility, which the juvenile court stayed. Appellant again violated his supervision. The Circuit Court, Racine County (Wisconsin) lifted the stay and placed appellant at the facility for one year commencing from the date the stay was lifted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, appellant contended that the juvenile court's order lifting the stay on appellant's placement impermissibly extended the duration of the original dispositional order beyond the one-year limitation set out in Wis. Stat. &sect; 938.355(4) (1999-2000) because that order had not been extended pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 938.365 (1999-2000). The appellate court held that the juvenile court's decision to stay appellant's placement eliminated the need for any extension of the original dispositional order.  Wis. Stat. &sect; 938.34(16) (1999-2000) permitted the juvenile court to stay the imposition of appellant's dispositional order, including revisions, in order to give the appellant a second chance to conform his behavior to any conditions imposed by the juvenile court. Failure to comply with the conditions triggered the commencement of the stayed portion of the dispositional order. Therefore the running of the one-year limitation of &sect; 938.355(4) as to appellant's placement commenced when the juvenile court lifted the stay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance company appealed an order of the Milwaukee County Circuit Court (Wisconsin) finding that a reducing clause in respondent insured's automobile insurance policy with appellant was invalid. The trial court also concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 632.32(5)(i) (1997-1998), which authorized reducing clauses, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the case of Dowhower v. West Bend Mutual Insurance Co. was dispositive. In that case, the Wisconsin Supreme Court determined that reducing clauses found in automobile underinsured motorist policies are not illusory, and it upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 632.32(5)(i). Appellant also asserted that the underinsured motorist provision of respondent's insurance policy was unambiguous and that summary judgment should have been granted in appellant's favor. The appellate court agreed with appellant, and it overturned the trial court's findings that &sect; 632.32(5)(i) was unconstitutional and that respondent's coverage under her underinsured motorist provision was illusory and contrary to public policy. Despite a typographical error, it was clear that the reducing clause, considered within the context of the whole policy, applied to respondent's underinsured motorist coverage. Because the evidentiary materials contained in the record demonstrated that there was no genuine issue of material fact, appellant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Lincoln County, Wisconsin, dismissed both of appellant's discharge petitions. Appellant sought reinstatement of the order for his supervised release, or, in the alternative, he sought a reversal of the order dismissing his 1997 or 2000 petitions for discharge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was a sexually violent person and was committed to the custody of the Department of Health and Family Services for control, care, and treatment. Appellant filed a petition for supervised release pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.08. Eventually, the parties agreed to a stipulation regarding appellant's release, but the department was unable to develop a plan regarding appellant's release because it could not find a place for appellant to live. The trial court then vacated the stipulation and denied appellant's petition for discharge. The trial court had the power to order the department to create facilities and services to provide for a plan to effectuate appellant's supervised release. Thus, the trial court improperly vacated the order for supervised release. The appellate court reversed and remanded with instructions that the trial court reinstate the order for supervised release, and if necessary, amend the release plan to effectuate appellant's prompt supervised release. The appellate court reversed the trial court's order dismissing appellant's petition for discharge and remanded for a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant business owner filed an appeal from the judgments of the Circuit Court for Juneau County (Wisconsin) upholding the constitutionality of a town ordinance prohibiting nude dancing in licensed establishments, and convicting the business owner of violations of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner contended that the town ordinance was facially overbroad, thereby infringing upon expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The appellate court held that the ordinance was facially overbroad because the preamble to the ordinance indicated that it was passed to combat the secondary effects of nude dancing; however, the ordinance encompassed expressive activities that did not implicate the secondary effects that the town could legitimately seek to regulate. The court was unwilling to limit or sever the offending portions of the ordinance because the degree to which the ordinance would need to be reconstructed would require rewriting the ordinance, thereby eliminating the legislative intent of the town, and contravening both the goal of a limiting reading under the overbreadth doctrine and the role of the judicial branch.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought treatment from defendant gynecologist for a cyst. Defendant recommended surgical removal. After surgery, plaintiff experienced considerable post-operative pain near the surgical site as well as secondary pain in a wide radius around it and missed work. Plaintiff sued defendant for negligence and a violation of her right to informed consent. The jury found that defendant had not been negligent, but that he failed to adequately inform plaintiff of other options. They awarded medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering damages. The trial court reduced the noneconomic damage award pursuant to state statute but refused to order a new trial. Plaintiff argued that the statute capping noneconomic damages was unconstitutional and defendant moved for a new trial in the interest of justice. The appellate court disagreed, stating the statute had been recently found constitutional. Since defendant failed to demonstrate a substantial probability of a different result on retrial, the appellate court declined to exercise its own discretionary reversal power.</SPAN></P>

Subsequent to the determination of paternity, appellant still did not make child support payments, cover other costs, or visit the child. Respondents, the child's mother and her husband, filed a petition to terminate appellant's parental rights. The trial court granted the petition, finding both abandonment and failure to assume parental responsibility. On appeal, appellant challenged the trial court's jurisdiction and contended that claim preclusion or issue preclusion barred the action. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that both venue and jurisdiction were proper, based on the child's residence and appellant's previous paternity action, which gave the trial court continuing jurisdiction. The action was not barred by claim or issue preclusion; the instant action was not a collateral attack on the judgment that appellant was the child's biological father, and appellant's paternity action did not address whether he had abandoned the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. Pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305 (1999-2000), blood samples were drawn and analysis of the blood revealed a blood alcohol content of .186. At trial, appellant objected to the admission of the blood analysis arrest based on an alleged break in the chain of custody. The Circuit Court, Jefferson County (Wisconsin) overruled the objection and convicted the appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the appellant contended that Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305 (1999-2000) was unconstitutional as applied to him. Second, appellant argued that the prosecution did not sufficiently establish the chain of custody of the blood samples drawn, and therefore they should not have been admitted into evidence at trial. The court rejected the appellant's contentions. The blood draw was taken to obtain evidence of intoxication during the course of a lawful arrest under circumstances in which the appellant was suspected of a drunk-driving related offense. The draw was conducted at the hospital under no objection from the appellant, and he did not argue that the method used was unreasonable. Therefore, the statute was not unconstitutional. Appellant's chain of custody argument centered on the fact that the box containing the samples was at one point opened so that mailing labels could be filled out, and was then resealed with heavy packing tape. The trial court properly held that, because of the consistency of the packaging of the tubes containing the blood samples, the issue of the missing link in the chain of custody went to the weight of the evidence, not to its admissibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The court held that the implied consent to testing statute was not unconstitutional as to the appellant. The sample was taken at a hospital, pursuant to a lawful arrest and the method was not unreasonable. The court found that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in the degree of proof necessary to establish a chain of custody and in allowing the blood sample analysis into evidence.</SPAN></P>

The State followed with a criminal complaint charging defendant as a second-time OWI offender. A jury found defendant guilty and he appealed, contending the belated charging violated his right to a speedy trial. The trial court ruled that the delay did not violate any of his constitutional rights. On appeal, the court affirmed. A determination of whether the defendant's right to a speedy trial was violated depended upon a balancing approach in which several factors were weighed. Among the factors considered included prejudice to the defendant. Defendant did not suffer any prejudice during the delay between the municipal court proceeding and later criminal proceeding because he believed that the matter had been put to rest.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the statute of repose set forth in Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the trial court's decision finding that she violated plaintiff village's ordinance pertaining to residential fences and imposing a forfeiture including costs against her. Defendant contended that the relevant provision, Village of Avoca, Wis., Ordinances &sect; 17.03(2)(c), regulated only fences on property lines and the structure on her property was not on a property line. Additionally, defendant alleged that the provision regulated only fences and the structure on her property was not a fence. The appellate court affirmed. Defendant's first contention was rejected because &sect; 17.03(2)(c) plainly applied to all fences in residential districts. An applicable definition of the term &quot;fence&quot; as used in &sect; 17.03(2)(c) was a barrier intended to prevent escape or intrusion or to mark a boundary. The structure erected on defendant's property constituted a &quot;fence&quot; as that term was defined, as it was admittedly a barrier intended to prevent intrusion on defendant's privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent inmate was serving a prison sentence for sexual assault offenses. The day before respondent's mandatory release date, petitioner State filed a petition for detention alleging that respondent was a sexually violent person.

The trial court ordered respondent to be committed to institutional care, pursuant to Wis. Stat. ch. 980. Respondent appealed. The appellate court affirmed. The trial court did not lose competency to handle the matter, because Wis. Stat. ch. 980 was not unconstitutionally applied to respondent. The trial court's findings were not clearly erroneous, and the record reflected that the petition was timely filed. Neither the statutes nor case law required respondent's release where the evidence showed that he was still dangerous, and, much more likely than not, to re-offend.

Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to suppress the results of his chemical test on the grounds that the implied consent statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(4) (1997-98), violated his due process rights because the statute misled accused persons regarding the consequences for taking or refusing the test. At the suppression hearing, the trial court determined that the officer had probable cause to stop and arrest. However, it concluded that the implied consent statute did materially mislead the defendant in a manner designed to try to convince and persuade him that he will be better off taking the test than not taking the test, which was fundamentally unfair and in contravention of due process. The court reversed. The court held that the statute did not mislead, therefore the defendant's due process argument failed. The informed consent statute alerted the defendant to the penalties that could result from violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(4) (1997-98), and the statute further informed that the test results could be used against the defendant in court. Therefore, the court concluded that the statute adequately advised the defendant of the consequences for consenting or refusing to take the test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed. The defendant failed to overcome the implied consent statute's presumption of constitutionality, therefore the trial court improperly excluded the results of the defendant's blood alcohol test. The informed consent statute alerted the defendant to the penalties that could result from refusing to submit to chemical testing and the statute further informed that the test results could be used against the defendant in court.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court rejected plaintiff's arguments and affirmed the trial court's dismissal of his action against defendants. Allowing the transfer of Wisconsin inmates to private correctional facilities in other states did not violate the Supremacy Clause by extending Wisconsin's territorial limits. Wisconsin did not extend its territorial limits by contracting with a Tennessee prison to house Wisconsin prisoners. Tennessee could withdraw its authorization to the private correctional corporation to do business within its state if it chose to do so. Plaintiff was mistaken in his supposition that private prison guards were exempt from liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Sending Wisconsin prisoners out of state did not violate an interstate compact agreement because the contract at issue was not one between two states and did not increase Wisconsin's political power in relation to federal authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) granted a declaratory judgment awarding plaintiffs stacked underinsured motorist coverage on two automobile insurance policies. Defendant insurer filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' son was injured by an underinsured vehicle. The parties stipulated to damages of $ 225,000, and plaintiffs received $ 50,000 from the underinsured driver's insurance company. Plaintiffs had two vehicles insured with defendant, each with coverage of $ 100,000 per person bodily injury; each had also a clause that reduced coverage by any amount paid from an underinsured motorist's coverage. Each policy also included a provision precluding the stacking of coverage. The trial court ruled that the anti-stacking clauses were invalid. The court of appeals reversed, holding that (1) the policy language clearly, without ambiguity, prohibited stacking; (2) the elasticity clause in the policy conformed the policy to the prevailing statutory law, which had validated the state's anti-stacking provision; (3) an amendment to the insurance statute authorizing reduction by the amount of UIM coverage did not unconstitutionally impair plaintiffs' right to contract; and (4) plaintiffs' coverage was not rendered illusory by the reducing clauses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court judgment reversed. The policy unambiguously prohibited stacking, and the prohibition was validated by law passed subsequent to the policy date.

Therefore plaintiffs had $ 100,000 in coverage available for the claim, which was reduced by the $ 50,000 received from the liable party's UIM coverage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was seen masturbating while sitting in a car parked next to a school bus located in front of an elementary school. Defendant pleaded guilty. He was convicted of lewd and lascivious behavior and disorderly conduct. The trial court denied defendant's motion for postconviction relief. Defendant appealed. On appeal, defendant alleged that his convictions were multiplicitous, and that the trial court erroneously exercised discretion in sentencing him to consecutive maximum prison terms totaling six years. The appellate court affirmed. The charges of lewd and lascivious behavior and disorderly conduct were not multiplicitous. Therefore, the convictions did not violate defendant's constitutional protection against double jeopardy, or did the trial court err in sentencing defendant. Given several factors including defendant's lengthy history of sex offenses, the trial court understandably gave the greatest weight to the protection of children who could have been endangered by defendant's conduct should he not have been incarcerated for as long as possible. The record supported the trial court's conclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment and an order of the circuit court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) entered after a jury found her guilty of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, fifth offense. She claimed that her trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to her six-person jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion seeking a new trial, alleging that she was denied her constitutional right to a 12-person jury, or in the alternative, that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance for failing to raise the issue. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that counsel's failure to object under the circumstances of the case did not constitute ineffective assistance. The statute authorizing a six-person jury panel at the time defendant was tried was good law, though it was later held unconstitutional. Counsel's failure to raise the issue did not constitute deficient performance. Defendant received an otherwise fair and error-free trial. The use of a 6-person jury rather than a 12-person jury did not undermine the fundamental integrity of her trial. Although it was conceivable that the chances for acquittal or a hung jury were greater with 12 jurors than with 6, that possibility, which was purely speculative, was insufficient to establish prejudice. Ineffective assistance of counsel cases were limited to situations where the law or duty was clear such that reasonable counsel should know enough to raise the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because trial counsel's decision not to object to a six person jury did not constitute ineffective assistance under the circumstances. Counsel was not required to object and argue a point of law that was unsettled. Even if counsel's failure to object constituted deficient performance, such conduct did not prejudice defendant.</SPAN></P>

Concluding that the warrantless entry did not violate defendant's U.S. Const. amend. IV rights, the appellate court affirmed. A warrantless, nonconsensual entry of a home to effect an arrest was reasonable under U.S. Const. amend. IV only where there was probable cause coupled with exigent circumstances. Both requirements were met in the case. The facts reasonably led the arresting officer to believe that defendant had been OMVWI, as he caused an accident, the officer was told that he smelled of intoxicants, he fled when informed the police would be called, and he had three prior OMVWI convictions. The rapid dissolution of alcohol from the bloodstream provided exigent circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, held in a non-final order that a cap imposed by the legislature on the recovery of noneconomic damages in medical malpractice actions within the scope of Wis. Stat. ch. 655 was unconstitutional. The defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that the cap violated both the right to a trial by jury recognized by the Wisconsin constitution, and the separation of powers between the judicial and legislative branches. On appeal, plaintiffs made several arguments to support the trial court's ruling that the cap was unconstitutional. The appellate court disagreed. The cap did not infringe on the right of trial by jury, under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, because the right to a jury trial was not affected, and the legislature could set the amount of recovery. The provision that the jury's findings were to be made without regard to the cap did not violate the separation of powers. Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, providing for access to courts, was not violated as plaintiffs did have a right to a remedy. Neither the plaintiffs' equal protection or substantive due process rights were violated because the cap was rationally related to the legislature's goal of providing health care, access to the courts was not a fundamental right requiring strict scrutiny, and their claim arose after the cap was enacted.</SPAN></P>

That provision allowed juvenile's convicted of certain offenses not including false imprisonment to be excused from the sex offender registration requirements. The court affirmed the trial court. Section 301.45(1m) did not violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection as applied to respondent since the classification created by that provision was rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of protecting the public. It was rational for the legislature to conclude that a juvenile who engaged in false imprisonment was a greater potential threat to public safety than a juvenile involved in a factually consensual sexual relationship with a child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a post-commitment order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) denying his motion to vacate a Wis. Stat. &sect; 980 judgment which committed him as a sexually violent person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, all four of the State's peremptory strikes were of men. On appeal, appellant described his first claim as a denial of means to obtain a meaningful review because of the trial court's refusal to record the jury selection. The court found, however, his claim was essentially an ineffective assistance of counsel claim for failure to assert a Batson objection based on gender. The court found the trial court acted within its discretion in denying appellant's request to record voir dire, because it provided a mechanism to address any objections that might have arisen during the jury selection process. Nevertheless, the court remanded the case so the trial court could conduct a hearing relative to the failure of appellant's counsel to raise a gender Batson inquiry, and its impact upon the jury selection. The trial court's failure to define the statutory term &quot;substantially probable&quot; did not render the relevant statute unconstitutionally vague, and trial counsel's performance was not deficient for failing to request a definitional instruction. Finally, testimony presented by the State's witnesses was sufficient to support the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order was affirmed in part, reversed in part; evidence was sufficient to show a nexus between appellant's particular mental disorder and his predisposition for sexual violence. Denial of appellant's request to record voir dire was proper, as trial court provided a mechanism to address any objections during jury selection process. Cause was remanded to determine whether counsel's waiver of Batson objection constituted ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a property tax dispute, plaintiff mobile home owners appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Rock County (Wisconsin) granting summary judgment to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mobile home owners challenged defendant town's taxation of their mobile homes as realty. They stipulated to having certain plaintiffs treated as representative of the others. The trial court dismissed their claims, holding that the mobile homes may not have been taxable as realty but none of them were exempt from personal property tax, which would have been equal to the tax imposed. The court affirmed in part, but on different grounds. Because the other statutory criteria were satisfied, with one exception, all of the representative plaintiffs' mobile homes could be taxed as improvements to real estate; some part of each mobile home's weight was off its wheels and set upon some other support. The remaining representative mobile home was not exempt from personal property tax as the combined area of the unit and its attached porch exceeded 400 square feet. However, because non-attached structures on a plaintiff's property could not be considered when calculating the mobile home's size, remand was necessary to determine whether any of the non-representative plaintiffs' mobile homes were exempt from personal property tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part. With one exception, all of the representative plaintiffs' mobile homes were properly taxed as realty. The single exception was subject to personal property tax equal to the real property tax imposed, so the tax imposed was not &quot;unlawful.&quot; However, remand was necessary to determine if non-representative plaintiffs' mobile homes were exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with both operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI), pursuant to Wis.

Defendant challenged the State's dual prosecution of both offenses on due process and double jeopardy grounds. The trial court rejected his argument, and subsequently he pled guilty to OWI and the PAC charge was dismissed. The court held simultaneous prosecution under both Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 346.63(1)(a) and (1)(b) did not violate notions of fundamental fairness and double jeopardy. Defendant did not request the court to declare the statutes unconstitutional. Instead, he argued that the courts should be required to submit only one charge to the jury as a matter of fundamental fairness and avoidance of double jeopardy. There could be no double jeopardy because the legislature did not authorize two convictions. Consequently, there could not be multiple punishments. The court also rejected any suggestion that the State should be required to make a pretrial election between the two charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband, driving for his employer, was hurt in a two car crash. Both plaintiff husband's policy and that of his employer had underinsured (UIM) coverage with reducing clauses for, among other things, worker's compensation benefits, which plaintiff husband received. Plaintiffs sued defendants, insurers, for compensation and moved for declarations that one UIM reducing clause was invalid for defendant, plaintiffs' insurer's, failure to follow Wis. Stat. &sect; 631.36(5) (1997-98)'s notice requirements as to UIM coverage changes, and that Wis. Stat. &sect; 632.32(5)(i) (1997-98) permitting such clauses, was unconstitutional. The trial court incorporated its denial of plaintiffs' motions in its final judgment. The court affirmed. Even though defendant insurer had gratuitously sent plaintiffs a renewal notice on their policy's UIM coverage changes, &sect; 631.36(5) did not apply as the changes were statutorily initiated rather than by defendant insurer. Section 632.32(5)(i) was constitutional as it did not deprive policy holders of any constitutional right and the policies' provisions unambiguously mimicked the statute; therefore the UIM coverage was not illusory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned a saloon with a video poker machine, in the Village of North Fond du Lac. The county district attorney and sheriff sent a letter to all county bar owners except those in the Village, warning that payouts by video poker machines would lead to criminal prosecution. Defendant's saloon was searched pursuant to a warrant, leading to a charge of commercial gambling. Defendant's motions to dismiss and to suppress evidence were denied, and he was convicted. On appeal, defendant claimed selective prosecution. The court reversed. The letter, sent to all county bars except in the Village, created arbitrary classifications of tavern owners - those who received the letter and those who did not. Defendant did not receive the letter and he was prosecuted, thus the letter had a discriminatory effect. The inequitable distribution of the letter was prima facie evidence of a purposeful intent to discriminate. Thus defendant made a prima facie showing of selective prosecution. Because the State did not offer a valid reason for the inequitable distribution of the letter, it failed to rebut by demonstrating a valid exercise of prosecutorial discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) affirming a decision of the Wisconsin Tax Appeals Commission upholding the determination by the Department of Revenue that appellants were not entitled to a refund of Wisconsin income taxes levied on their federal civil service pensions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were federal employees and members of the federal civil service (CSRS) pension fund who had left federal service before the cutoff date, and were reemployed sometime thereafter. Upon reemployment, they exercised the option to reinstate their retirement benefit credits and pension eligibility by paying back the amounts they had withdrawn from the fund. According to the Wisconsin Tax Appeals Commission (commission), the fact that employees whose service was interrupted could &quot;repurchase&quot; prior years of employment for benefit determination purposes did not erase their absence from federal employment on December 31, 1963, or otherwise retroactively employ them so that they could be considered to have been actually employed on that date. The court found that while appellants could recapture the lost credits for the earlier years of employment by paying back the withdrawal, they could not render themselves &quot;members&quot; of the system on a specific date when they concededly were not employed by the government. Thus, the commission's decision denying them a refund of Wisconsin income taxes levied on their federal civil service pensions was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; appellants could pay back the amounts they had withdrawn from the federal civil service pension fund upon reemployment, but they could not erase their absence from federal employment or retroactively employ themselves to achieve an exemption from Wisconsin state income taxes. Thus, appellants were not entitled to refund from state income taxes levied on their pensions.</SPAN></P>

The court placed defendant on probation with a number of conditions, including that defendant was to serve six months in county jail without good time. The court then stayed three months of that six month period and stated that the additional three months could be imposed at the discretion of defendant's probation agent. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court did not have the authority to order that his jail term to be served without good time nor the authority to authorize the probation agent to impose jail time at his or her discretion. The instant court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 302.43 (1997-98), 973.155 (1997-98) did not entitle an offender to earn good time for jail confinement imposed as a condition of probation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiff's husband died at home, a funeral home informed plaintiff that the death had to be medically confirmed before the body would be removed from the home.

The investigator withdrew fluid from husband's eyes. After husband's body was taken to the funeral home, cosmetic work was performed so that the eyes no longer appeared depressed. Plaintiff brought claims against defendants and summary judgment in defendants' favor. On appeal, the court held that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity from plaintiff's federal and state law claims. Public employees at the scene were performing their duties. Plaintiff's rights were not violated because she consented to have official enter her home to obtain a pronouncement of her husband's death. The investigator followed lawful procedures set out by a medical examiner, established pursuant to Wis. Admin. Code &sect; 135.08. Therefore, the court held that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to defendants. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that his Intoxilyzer test results were inadmissible as a matter of law because an accuracy test was not conducted on the Intoxilyzer machine per the schedule required by Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for operating his motorcycle while intoxicated (OWI) and with a prohibited blood alcohol concentration. At trial, defendant moved to suppress evidence of the Intoxilyzer test results. The basis for his motion was that the Department of Transportation had not tested the Intoxilyzer equipment for accuracy according to the schedule required by Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 343.305(6)(b). The jury acquitted defendant of the OWI charge but found him guilty of the remaining charge. On appeal, defendant argued that the test results were not admissible as a matter of law because the testing schedule was not followed. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress the test result was proper and the trial court reasonably exercised its discretion by admitting the breath test results. The court found that the reason the machine had been tested at regular intervals before defendant's test and was not re-tested any time after defendant's test was that it was removed from the sheriff's department in anticipation of replacement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from a judgment of the circuit court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), denying his request that Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37(6) (1997-98) be declared unconstitutional contending the exception for taxpayers who resided in counties with a population of 500,000 or more which prevented them from having a de novo circuit court review of property tax assessments was unfair.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was unhappy with the reassessed value of his real property. Instead of pursuing a certiorari review in circuit court, he sought a ruling that Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37(6) was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37 provided a taxpayer the opportunity for a de novo circuit court review, but Wis.

The court found a rational relationship between the classification created by the &quot;500,000 or more&quot; language and a legitimate government purpose. The exception did not violate the equal protection clause, did not establish a new form or type of taxation, or set up a method or system for assessment and collection of taxes, or violate the proscription that no private or local bill embrace more than one subject. The court concluded plaintiff failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37(6) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was arrested at the scene of an accident following his admission that he had been drinking. Respondent was taken to a hospital for a blood test. The arresting officer did not obtain a warrant for the blood test, but respondent did not request that he be given an alternate form of test, nor did he ever refuse to take the blood test. The trial court concluded that appellant failed to meet its burden to justify the warrantless blood test and ordered the blood test suppressed. The blood was taken to obtain evidence of intoxication from a person lawfully arrested for drunk-driving. There was a clear indication that evidence of intoxication would be produced. The method used was reasonable. Respondent presented no objection to the test. Therefore the search was constitutionally permissible, and the trial court erred in granting respondent's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court erred in granting respondent's motion to suppress. Evidence of the blood test was admissible because it met the constitutional requirements for warrantless blood tests. The blood draw was a reasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from the trial court's judgment affirming defendants' denial of his request for a variance from the applicable zoning ordinance and dismissing his cause of action brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Plaintiff contended that the setback requirement in the zoning ordinance violated his equal protection rights, that the variance denial should have been set aside because defendant board of appeals violated the open meetings law, and that the evidence did not support denial of the variance request. The court affirmed. As to the equal protection argument, the court concluded that plaintiff had not overcome the presumption of validity, as the court was not persuaded that the ordinance failed to bear a rational relationship to its essential purpose. It was found that even if a closed session held by defendant board of appeals violated the open meetings law, the decision to deny the variance would still have stood because the vote was held in an open session. Also, the evidence supported denial of the variance request because the reasons advanced for the variance were personal in nature and personal convenience was found not to be a sufficient basis for a variance.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's policy limit was $ 250,000; it relied on its &quot;other insurance&quot; policy provision to limit its responsibility. Plaintiffs argued: (1) defendant's policy was ambiguous and should have been construed in favor of $ 225,000 coverage; (2) Wis. Stat. &sect; 632.32(5)(g) did not permit a reduction in coverage; and (3) if construed to permit a reduction in coverage, &sect; 632.32(5)(g) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendant. Defendant's &quot;other insurance&quot; provision defining its proportionate share of its underinsured motorist coverage was not ambiguous. Plaintiffs' interpretation was not reasonably supported by the policy language. Section 632.32(5)(g) did not bar defendant from reducing coverage by its proportionate share ratio. Moreover, &sect; 632.32(5)(g) did not deprive plaintiffs of any state or federal constitutional right to enter into insurance contracts without fraud and, as a result, the statute did not violate substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of engaging in repeated acts of sexual assault of the same child. On appeal, he contended that Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.025 was unconstitutional on its face and as applied. He further contended that he should have been allowed to present testimony that his former father-in-law had solicited someone to have him killed. This was offered to support appellant's theory that his ex-wife and her father wanted him out of their lives. The court affirmed, holding that the jury was properly instructed that it must unanimously agree that appellant committed at least three assaults, but that it need not agree on which acts constituted the required three. This did not unconstitutionally permit the jury to avoid unanimity, because unanimity was required only with respect to the ultimate issue of appellant's guilt or innocence. Appellant's &quot;hit-man&quot; evidence was properly excluded as unfairly prejudicial and confusing.</SPAN></P>

Upon respondents' motion, the circuit court dismissed his complaint on grounds that he failed to plead administrative remedies exhaustion, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 801.02(7) (1997-98). Appellant's complaint challenged the constitutionality of administrative rules forbidding inmates from receiving, by mail, pornographic tapes and other materials.

While failure to plead exhaustion of administrative remedies was generally fatal to a complaint, the appellate court concluded that an attempt to have an administrative agency determine the constitutionality of a statute was &quot;futile.&quot; The appellate court reversed, holding that to require the appellant to exhaust institutional and administrative remedies to advance his constitutional challenges, as a precondition to raising them, was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced to prison after his conviction for armed robbery and the trial court also imposed &quot;applicable costs&quot; on the appellant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court conditionally reversed an order to place appellant mother's daughter in foster care in a Child in Need of Protective Services (CHIPS) proceeding.

The court held that when a parent requested counsel, or when the circumstances otherwise raised a reasonable concern that the parent would not be able to provide meaningful self-representation, the court had to exercise its discretion to determine whether or not to appoint counsel. The court found that when appellant requested counsel, displayed erratic behavior, and was evaluated as suffering from a mental disorder, the juvenile court should have considered whether to appoint counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Crawford County Circuit Court, Wisconsin, awarding him attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 (1994) of $ 175 per hour, arguing that the evidence showed that the reasonable rate for his attorney's services was $ 285 per hour.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A forfeiture action was brought against appellant by appellee for his failure to comply with its ordinance regulating large assemblies during a political and social gathering that was promoted and organized by appellant. The prosecution against appellant was dismissed, and the trial court awarded him $ 175 per hour as attorney fees. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the record did not support $ 175 as a reasonable rate for appellant's attorney's fees. Appellant presented ample evidence, including his attorney's affidavit outlining his skill and experience and affidavits of four other civil rights attorneys, that his attorney's billing rate of $ 285 per hour was consistent with the current market rate and therefore was presumptively reasonable. The trial court's decision to award $ 175 per hour based on an affidavit of one attorney and its own belief that $ 285 was not reasonable and therefore was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed because the record did not support $ 175 per hour as a reasonable rate for appellant's attorney's services as it was based on one attorney's affidavit and the trial court's own belief. Case remanded for determination of appellant's attorney's reasonable rate for services.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for battery, criminal damage to property, and two counts of disorderly conduct, as well as appealing from the trial court's order denying his motions for postconviction relief. Defendant argued that his convictions were violative of the Wisconsin Constitution because his trials were before six-person juries under a statute that was subsequently declared unconstitutional, as well as arguing that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the six-person juries. The court affirmed. The court held that defendant's failure to make a constitutional objection to the six-person juries at his trials waived or forfeited his constitutional claim presented on appeal. As to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the court concluded that the claim necessarily failed, because, even assuming that counsel performed deficiently, the performance did not prejudice defendant.

Affirming, the court held to commit a bail jumping offense, one had to intentionally violate the condition of a bond. Appellant contended that there was no evidence of her intent because there was no evidence she knew or understood that her close proximity to the specific individual violated the no contact provision. The court found a reasonable jury could infer, using its common knowledge and ordinary experience, that appellant understood that the &quot;no contact&quot; provision barred close physical proximity as well as express communication or physical touching with the named individual.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed an appeal from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Jefferson County (Wisconsin), convicting him for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1). Appellant contended the trial court erred in concluding that the initial stop was constitutionally permissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant moved to suppress evidence, arguing he was detained without reasonable suspicion. The trial court denied appellant's motion, concluding from the arresting officer's testimony that dispatch information regarding a possible drunk driver, combined with the officer's observations of appellant's poor driving, provided reasonable suspicion to stop appellant. Once stopped, appellant's bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, and difficulty in removing his driver's license, in addition to a strong alcoholic odor, justified further detaining and questioning. Appellant was convicted and appealed. Affirming, the court concluded that the officer had reasonable suspicion at that time, based on the information he received from dispatch, and his subsequent observations of appellant's driving. Those additional observations increased the likelihood that appellant was driving while under the influence of an intoxicant, and provided ample basis for the officer to ask appellant to provide his driver's license and to question him about his drinking. Thus, appellant's motion to suppress was properly denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The call to dispatch describing the operator of the vehicle as a &quot;possible drunk driver,&quot; in combination with the officer's observation of the vehicle fishtailing, constituted a reasonable suspicion that appellant was under the influence of an intoxicant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant filed an appeal from an order of the Circuit Court for Portage County (Wisconsin), denying her motion to vacate a judgment convicting her of misdemeanor bail jumping. Appellant asserted numerous issues, including ineffective trial counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, charged with disorderly conduct, was released on bond, however, she could not possess or consume any intoxicants. Appellant was charged two more times with misdemeanor bail jumping due to violating &quot;no intoxicant&quot; conditions. She pled no contest. The circuit court accepted appellant's plea, finding her guilty. Appellant's motion for postconviction relief was denied and she appealed. Affirming, the court held that the circuit court sufficiently reviewed the record for facts to substantiate appellant's ineffective assistance claim. However, the record conclusively demonstrated that appellant was not entitled to relief. Additionally, there was no evidence that the State unconstitutionally suppressed evidence of appellant's alcoholism, because, from the record, it appeared that appellant's attorney was aware that appellant had an alcohol problem and wanted to assert an &quot;alcoholism defense.&quot; Appellant failed to identify what additional evidence available to the State, but not revealed to defense counsel, would have aided her defense; thus, her conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Appellant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was not supported by the record. Although appellant claimed the State unconstitutionally suppressed evidence of her alcoholism, she failed to establish what additional evidence that was not revealed to her attorney would have helped in her defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband, wife, and father sued defendant corporation alleging nuisance and negligence for stray voltage that had damaged their dairy farm operation. A jury verdict found in favor of plaintiff and the lower court granted defendant's motion for a stay of execution of the judgment pending appeal. The court remanded the case for consideration of the Gudenschwager factors. The lower court issued a partial stay and plaintiffs appealed arguing that that because defendant had met only two of the four factors, it was not entitled to any stay. That plaintiff did not meet the first of the Gudenschwager factors was irrelevant to a stay of a money judgment because the tests were not independent tests, but, rather, interrelated factors that the court was to weigh. Also, the lower court had a wide range of discretion in deciding whether to grant a stay.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, finding that appellant's postconviction counsel was not ineffective and the record supported that counsel advised appellant of his options concerning the no merit report; that appellant was fully advised of the operation of the felony murder statute and the maximum sentence; that appellant's double jeopardy argument was meritless, as he was not sentenced for the armed robbery, but the maximum armed robbery sentence did affect the sentence he could receive for felony murder; there was nothing in the trial court's remarks to suggest that the trial court was following a preconceived rigid sentencing policy or that it failed to exercise its discretion; and the trial court properly exercised its discretion in sentencing appellant to the maximum term of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Appellant's postconvicton counsel was not ineffective and appellant was fully advised of his options concerning the no merit report.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the circuit court for La Crosse County (Wisconsin) dismissing his appeal from a municipal court conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the municipal court impermissibly required him to pay his forfeiture for conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant before the circuit court would have jurisdiction over his appeal. The court held that appellant's assessment of the requirements to perfect his appeal was incorrect. Wis. Stat. &sect; 800.14(2) required appellant to execute a bond for the payment of his forfeiture, should he not prevail on appeal. This was not a request to pay the forfeiture. Precedent holding that failure to pay the filing fee did not deprive an appellate court of jurisdiction was inapplicable, because the issue was the posting of a bond, not the payment of a filing fee. Any analogy to the rules for Wisconsin appellate courts was also inapposite, because the rules for appeals to a circuit court from a municipal court fell under a different statutory scheme.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of his municipal court appeal, because appellant did not post the forfeiture bond required by statute. Appellant's posting of this bond was a requirement for appeal, without which the lower court properly dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>
