<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Incident to a plea bargain, the inmate pled guilty to second-degree reckless homicide while armed, and second-degree recklessly endangering safety while armed, in exchange for the State's motion to dismiss a possession of marijuana charge and its sentencing recommendation of an unspecified period of confinement. The trial court accepted the inmate's guilty pleas, dismissed the marijuana charge, and imposed eighteen- and four-year consecutive sentences, comprised of equal nine- and two-year periods of confinement and extended supervision. Postconviction counsel was appointed, but she refused to pursue the claims the inmate identified, and rather than pursuing a no-merit appeal, she closed the file as the inmate requested. Defendant failed to pursue postconviction or appellate relief, but later filed a pro se postconviction motion pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06 (2003-04). The appellate court affirmed the denial of the inmate's motion as (1) the inmate's guilty plea waived his defenses regarding an unconstitutional arrest, and (2) the inmate did not allege that but for his counsel's alleged ineffectiveness that he would have instead proceeded to trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found appellant guilty of attempted first-degree intentional homicide and armed robbery. The circuit court imposed a forty-year sentence for the attempted homicide, and withheld sentence and imposed a twenty-five-year consecutive term of probation for the armed robbery. The instant action was appellant's third postconviction motion. The appellate court found that in the instant motion, appellant failed to offer the circuit court any reason, much less a sufficient reason, for his failure to raise the particular ineffective-assistance claim in his prior postconviction motions. The appellate court ruled that the circuit court therefore properly held that appellant's claim was procedurally barred by the Wisconsin Supreme Court Escalona-Naranjo decision. Also, the circuit court correctly denied appellant's motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence. Appellant failed to provide in his postconviction motion any newly discovered evidence that would corroborate the recantation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sheriff appealed an order of the Milwaukee County Circuit Court, Wisconsin, which granted a writ of mandamus ordering the sheriff to reinstate intervenor employee as a deputy sheriff sergeant. The sheriff had relieved the employee of his duties as a sergeant and reassigned the employee pending a hearing before respondent county personnel review board (PRB) on the sheriff's petition to demote the employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PRB sought a writ of mandamus to enforce its order made pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.52(8)(b) (2003-2004) that the sheriff did not have the authority to demote the employee while the sheriff's petition to demote the employee was pending before the PRB. The court concluded that the PRB had standing to seek the writ and that the issue was not moot. The court also concluded that both the PRB and the employee had a clear right to relief. The sheriff had a positive and plain legal duty to follow the PRB's reinstatement order and was not free to simply ignore it. The employee was personally affected by the sheriff's order relieving him of duties as a sergeant. The PRB was substantially damaged by the sheriff's decision to ignore its order reinstating the employee to the rank of sergeant. Neither the PRB nor the sheriff had an adequate remedy at law. Without the mechanism of mandamus, the PRB had no ability to preserve the authority it had been given, or the integrity of the disciplinary system that it oversaw. The employee sought out the only remedy available when he believed the sheriff's actions toward him were in violation of relevant statutes and ordinances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owner sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which dismissed consolidated actions for declaratory judgment and certiorari relief after respondent town denied the owner's application for approval to construct a new residence on family farm land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner filed an application for approval to construct a new residence on family farm land in an exclusive agricultural district. A zoning administrator denied the application. The town board of adjustment upheld the decision. The trial court consolidated the owner's certiorari action with an ongoing declaratory judgment action. The trial court upheld the zoning administrator's method for calculating substantial income from a farm operation and upheld the board's decision. On appeal, the court saw no reason why the zoning administrator could not have undertaken both the substantial income review and the conformity-with-agricultural-use analysis at the same stage in its review of an application for a zoning permit. The fact that the zoning administrator might have incorrectly labeled the considerations under Dane Co., Wis., Code of Ordinances &sect; 10.123(9)(f) (2000) as part of the analysis under subsection (2)(b) did not change the substance of his reasoning. Notwithstanding the zoning administrator's reference to &quot;farm income plan&quot; review, it was clear from the entirety of his discussion that the application was rejected under &sect; 10.123(9)(f), not (2)(b).</SPAN></P>

The court granted the writ in part and denied it in part. The Wisconsin Office of the State Public Defender (SPD) filed a motion to reconsider and requested to intervene. The court granted the SPD permission to intervene. After reviewing the briefs, the court found that petitioner knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to pursue an appeal challenging the validity of his plea of no contest to second-degree sexual assault. The court rejected petitioner's claim that he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel when his attorney did not pursue the plea withdrawal issue. Further, petitioner's constitutional right to effective representation for the purpose of exercising his right to directly appeal his conviction did not require his postconviction counsel to offer him the option of a &quot;partial no-merit&quot; report on any potential issues remaining after petitioner declined for strategic reasons to pursue an issue having arguable merit. It could not be a violation of &quot;professional norms&quot; to not file a no-merit report when one was not clearly required by Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Milwaukee County, Wis., Ordinance 00-15 made four changes to the Employes' Retirement System. Ordinance 00-15 enhanced benefits for some but not all participants in the retirement system and reduced the vesting period for benefits from ten to five years. Class representatives of members of the Milwaukee County Employes' Retirement System argued that the ordinance constituted an unconstitutional taking because the changes reduced stability. The court disagreed. Ordinance 00-15 created benefit enhancements. The class representatives did not demonstrate that the ordinance was the cause of negative effects on the retirement system. Referral of the ordinance to the Pension Study Commission satisfied the referral requirement in 1965 Wis. Sess. Laws ch. 405, &sect; 2. The Commission's minutes and a letter from the retirement system's actuary constituted a &quot;written report&quot; within the meaning of 1965 Wis. Sess. Laws ch. 405. The court did not err in striking the affidavit of a legal expert submitted by the class representatives, because it contained only conclusions of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was employed by a county sheriff's department and worked as a bailiff at a courthouse. He was charged with one count of misconduct in public office and one count of second-degree sexual assault; sexual contact or intercourse by a correctional staff member, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(2)(h) (2003-04). The trial court denied his motions to dismiss the charges against him. On appeal, the court found that, based on the plain meaning of the statute, defendant was not a &quot;correctional staff member.&quot; The statute did not extend to a county sheriff's deputy who was assigned to work in a courthouse. The courthouse was not a &quot;correctional institution.&quot; Although defendant's work as a bailiff caused him to enter the criminal justice facility to move inmates from that building to the courthouse, such incidental conduct did not fall under the plain meaning of &quot;working at a correctional institution.&quot; The plain meaning of the statute clearly applied to those who worked within the criminal justice facility, not to a courthouse bailiff who entered the facility simply to move inmates to the courthouse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual's protective placement began in June 1998, and the individual's placement had been subject to annual court reviews. The individual's most recent review was held in July 2005, nearly fourteen months after her last review. The individual was seventy years old and had significant mental health problems. The individual's thyroid gland had been removed, requiring her to take daily medication. The individual had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and chronic paranoid personality disorder, and exhibited the &quot;inevitable deterioration of aging.&quot; The appellate court ruled that the individual waived her right to challenge the circuit court's competency to proceed with her review because she failed to raise the issue before the circuit court. Also, the evidence was sufficient to support the protective placement order. The individual was so totally incapable of caring for herself as to substantially risk self-harm. The individual's inability to self-medicate created a substantial risk of harm to herself because it created a substantial risk that, if the individual were living independently, she would stop taking her medication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and son appealed from an order dismissing their action against the district. They had brought an action claiming that the son could not be required by the instructor to complete summer homework. The trial court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, concluding that under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 118.001, 120.12(14) and 120.13 (2003-04), it was within the school district's, and therefore the instructor's, authority to require summer homework. Summer homework, particularly for an honors class for which students received additional credit, fit comfortably within the range of what was reasonable. The court concluded that the instructor had the authority to assign summer homework, that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 118.001, 120.12(14) and 120.13 (2003-04) were not unconstitutional, and that summer homework did not infringe on parents' right to direct the education and upbringing of their children.

The brother angrily approached his sister at the pool and began calling her offensive names in a loud voice. He leaned over her in a threatening manner and pointed his fingers in her face. The more she ignored him the louder and angrier he became. His actions drew the attention of others in the area. As the family left the pool area, a tennis ball was aimed at and struck one of the children. The sister's children were frightened then and remained frightened for some time afterward.

The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because the victims he videotaped had a reasonable expectation of privacy: (1) the bathroom was on the second floor of the building; (2) defendant's house appeared vacant and actually was generally vacant during the summer; (3) there was a tree that blocked the view of the bathroom window from the ground during the summer; (4) over 10 feet separated defendant's house from the victims' house; (5) the victims were located four to five feet from the window when defendant videotaped them; and (6) a reasonable jury could infer that defendant was using a zoom feature to see the victims.</SPAN></P>

He argued that habeas corpus was the proper mechanism for reviewing the constitutionality of Wisconsin's &quot;sexual predator&quot; law, Wis.

Because the inmate had legal remedies other than habeas corpus available to challenge his commitment, the court affirmed the circuit court's order. Whether he had been denied relief improperly was a question that should have been raised in an appeal, not in a habeas corpus petition. Moreover, were the court to assume that the inmate was not barred from seeking habeas corpus relief, his request for relief would still be meritless because it was based on an inaccurate analysis of the case law.</SPAN></P>

The grandparents and the grandchild raised numerous issues on appeal. First, they challenged the legal standard applied by the circuit court. They also challenged the circuit court's application of that standard to the facts. Next, they contested the circuit court's credibility determinations. Finally, they contended that the circuit court heavily relied on the guardian ad litem (GAL). The appellate court first addressed whether the Barstad standard was the applicable legal standard for a guardianship action under Wis. Stat. &sect; 880.09. The appellate court determined that the circuit court properly applied the standard to the evidence when it found that there was a need for a guardian. Further, extraordinary circumstances that drastically affected the welfare of the child, which would compel awarding guardianship to the grandparents, did not exist. The circuit court's discretionary rulings regarding the evidence were supported by the record facts and were explained in a rational way on the record. Finally, there was no evidence that the circuit court simply adopted the GAL's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The case was before the circuit court on certiorari review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a fireman, appealed from the order affirming the Board's decision to terminate his employment. The employee contended that he was discharged under fire department rules that were unconstitutionally vague as applied. Disciplinary charges had been filed against the employee and others pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.13(5)(b) (1999-2000), for violating rules of the fire department, which included possessing and using cocaine and marijuana. The court disagreed and affirmed, stating that the rules had been previously applied by the fire department and the Board to off-duty conduct. The employee effectively admitted that a plain reading of the rules informed firefighters that the rules applied to off-duty conduct. The court further stated that it was satisfied that the record did not reflect that the employee's expectation that discharge was not among the possible penalties was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Chippewa County, Wisconsin, granted judgment in favor of respondent father by applying the serial-family payer rule and the shared placement formula and set the amount of child support the father had to pay at $10 per month, even though the father paid $1,050 per month for another child born subsequently but who obtained a support order first. Appellant mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the trial court erred in applying the serial-family payer formula to reduce the father's child support obligation. The appellate court found that in order to properly exercise discretion justifying a disparity where the child support award for one child was $1,050 per month and the award for another child was $10 per month, the trial court had to consider the factors in Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.25(1m) (2001-02). The trial court erroneously exercised its discretion by failing to consider the statutory factors and articulate its reasoning in this case. When applying the statutory factors, the court was free to refuse to apply the serial-family payer rule if, after consideration of the enumerated factors, it determined by the greater weight of the credible evidence that use of the rule would be unfair to the child or one of the parties. Basic fairness required that, at the very least, the serial-family payer analysis had to take into consideration the income level used to establish the first support order. The trial court did not indicate whether it considered that the mother's expenses apparently exceeded her income.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner county sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Dunn County (Wisconsin), which upheld an order from the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC) that contested provisions in a collective bargaining agreement with respondent union were mandatory subjects of bargaining under Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.70(1)(a) (2003-04).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union was the collective bargaining representative for two units of employees in the county sheriff's department. The collective bargaining agreement between the union and the county expired. The expired agreement contained several provisions that the union wanted to include in the new agreement. The county refused. Because the county disputed whether it was required to bargain over the provisions, it filed a petition for a declaratory ruling with WERC pursuant to &sect; 111.70(4)(b). WERC concluded that the contested provisions were mandatory subjects of bargaining under &sect; 111.70(1)(a). The circuit court upheld WERC's decision. On appeal, the court concluded that only the &quot;court security officer&quot; provision impermissibly intruded upon the sheriff's constitutionally protected prerogatives. Because the sheriff chose the ways and means of performing protected duties, the balance between various and competing prerogatives had to ultimately be struck by the sheriff, not a collective bargaining agreement. The remaining provisions related only to hours and conditions of employment and were properly considered to be mandatory bargaining subjects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the holding that the &quot;court security officer&quot; provision of the collective bargaining agreement was a mandatory subject of bargaining between the union and the county.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff businesses appealed a decision of the Circuit Court for Sheboygan County, Wisconsin, which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, a city and resort condominiums, in the businesses' challenge to the city's appropriations for the resort under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.0615 (2003-04). The businesses objected to the agreement between defendants because it allowed the city to finance the resort project with tax dollars.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's master plan for the property at issue called for a convention center. The businesses also objected to the expenditure of room tax dollars for other purposes. The court held that under &sect; 66.0615(1m)(d)2, the city's expenditures were proper so long as the city limited them to tourism promotion or development. The court concluded that the legislature intended &quot;tourism promotion and development&quot; to mean the promotion and development of travel for recreational, business or educational purposes. The record demonstrated that the resort did draw travelers for those purposes. Nothing in the record indicated that the resort's operation of both the resort and a restaurant led to commingling of either capital or revenues. The businesses' argument that the resort was a &quot;conference&quot; center as opposed to a &quot;convention&quot; center failed because the court relied on the average person's perception of the work. Also, because of its integration with the conference center, the court deemed the city's use of room tax dollars to retire debt related to the restaurant proper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant health care providers challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Marinette County (Wisconsin) in favor of appellee patient in the patient's action claiming that he was negligently discharged from the hospital despite evidence of a life-threatening infection. The patient cross-appealed the trial court's reduction in damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient suffered a severe burn at work, and after awaking with chills sought attention at the hospital where he was treated by the providers. His wound was treated and the patient was discharged. Later, the hospital phoned the patient and told him that his blood tests were abnormal. Due to a severe infection, the patient's bladder was destroyed and he required surgery and other treatment. The court held that a contributory negligence instruction was not warranted because no expert evidence was presented that any delay in the patient's return to the hospital contributed to his injury. Also, the causation instruction was proper because the instruction used equivalent language to Wis. Jury Instructions Civ. No. 1023 (2004), and a reasonable jury would not interpret &quot;substantial factor&quot; to mean &quot;less than a substantial factor.&quot; Because the parties failed to adhere to Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.40, the court remanded for the circuit court to address the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 655.015 (2003-04) and the administrative rule implementing it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed as to the constitutional issue and remanded for the circuit court to address the constitutionality of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While on parole from a prior conviction, defendant was charged with burglary and theft and then charged with battery by a prisoner while in jail. At the battery trial, the victim testified that defendant and a group beat him. Due to some misunderstandings about the plea agreement, defendant pled guilty to burglary and the trial court dismissed the theft and battery charges. On motion of the State, the trial court reopened the battery case and vacated defendant's battery and burglary pleas. The court held that defendant waived the arguments that because the trial court made no explicit finding regarding the true terms of the plea agreement, the State should be bound by the terms recited at the plea hearing and his double jeopardy argument because the arguments were not made below. Defendant was not denied a unanimous verdict because jurors needed not unanimously agree whether defendant was guilty because he was the direct actor or he aided and abetted a direct actor. The evidence was sufficient in that while defendant admitted calling the victim a derogatory name in the presence of people who were beating the victim and thus he was supportive of the direct actors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county amended Milwaukee County, Wis., Ordinance, ch. 201 to provide that administrative expenses of the retirement system were made obligations of the system. The court affirmed and held that the system complied with 1965 Wis. Laws, ch. 405 in that several days before the board's adoption of the amendment, the system's actuary presented his projections and advised it that the system was adequately funded to accommodate the change, and that the change would not materially affect the funding of the plan. The system participants did not have a right to dictate how the system was administered on a day-to-day basis. The legislature empowered the county to make any changes in the system which may be deemed necessary for the continued operation of the system, provided participants' rights and benefits were neither &quot;diminished&quot; nor &quot;impaired&quot; by the change. The method by which the system's administrative costs had been paid since the amendment was neither illegal nor unconstitutional, and there is no violation of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff adult entertainment gift store appealed from an order of the circuit court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) that granted summary judgment dismissing the store's complaint for a declaratory judgment that the defendant city's comprehensive adult entertainment ordinances and a new zoning ordinance, Oak Creek, Wis., City Code Ordinance &sect;&sect; 7.203, 3.40, 17.0901, and 17.0317, were unconstitutional and that the license fees were reasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted ordinances that defined adult entertainment businesses (AEB), imposed licensing and fee requirements, and rezoned the area where the store was located, so that its operation constituted a nonconforming use. The city denied the store's plan to construct a new larger building at the same location. The store filed suit alleging that the city's ordinances were unconstitutional and later amended its complaint to allege that it had changed its operations and no longer fell within the definition of an AEB. On appeal, the court held that the store had waived its right to challenge the council's determination that the store was an AEB because it did not file an administrative appeal as provided in Wis. Stat. &sect; 68.13. The court held that the store did not present sufficient evidence to create disputed issues as to the unconstitutionality of the ordinances because the store had not alleged the loss of any specific right or property as the result of the zoning ordinance and the store did not produce facts to dispute the city's evidence that established the need for the AEB ordinances and a rational basis for the licensing fees.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that the concern about using an insufficiently proven fact to increase a penalty beyond the statutory maximum was not implicated in this case. The sentencing court considered defendant's refusal to submit to a chemical test only in determining the length of sentence within the statutory limits, not to exceed them. The Sixth Amendment was not implicated because the sentence fell within statutory limits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to felony bail jumping. The trial court reasoned that the maximum term of probation for a felony bail jumping conviction, a class H felony, was six years in that the maximum term of confinement is three years and the maximum term of extended supervision was three years under Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.01(2)(b) and (d) (2003-04). The trial court then added one year for each of defendant's felony convictions for a total term of probation of eight years pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.09(2)(b) (2003-04). The court reversed. The court commuted defendant's eight-year term of probation to a five-year term because &sect; 973.09(2) plainly and unambiguously provided that the maximum term of probation was dependent upon the maximum term of confinement for the crime committed and not, as the trial court held, the maximum term of imprisonment. The maximum term of confinement for a class H felony was three years. Also the condition of probation and extended supervision banishing defendant from a township was unduly restrictive. The dual goals of rehabilitation and protection of the community interest were already functionally accomplished by a more narrowly drawn no contact condition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner was found guilty of first-degree intentional homicide for killing a young man who disappeared while soliciting door-to-door. The State's theory was that young man was the victim of &quot;homosexual overkill,&quot; and videotapes, photographs and magazines depicting actual murders, mutilation, homosexual acts and other pornography were seized from the petitioner's home and introduced as evidence at trial. A federal court rejected the petitioner's claim that his First Amendment rights were violated by admission of materials protected by the First Amendment. In his postconviction motion, the petitioner argued that because he had a First Amendment right to possess sexually expressive materials, such materials could not be seized or used as evidence against him and that his constitutional rights were violated by evidence of &quot;homosexual overkill.&quot; The appellate court ruled that the federal court's holding was law of the case. The federal district court held that in the face of the petitioner's First Amendment challenge, the warrant passed constitutional muster, and the petitioner could not relitigate claims that the material should not have been used as evidence at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant crashed his vehicle into a tree, severely injuring his passenger. No alcohol was detected in defendant's blood, but substantial amounts of cocaine and metabolites of cocaine were found. He pled no contest to one count of injury by intoxicated use of a motor vehicle. On appeal, he challenged the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.25(1)(am). The court found that the statutory scheme did not create rebuttable and irrebuttable presumptions of guilt. Rather, the statute simply defined a criminal offense and an affirmative defense to that offense. Further, the statute did not create an impermissible &quot;status offense.&quot; The statute penalized conduct, not status. A defendant could not be penalized simply for being a drug addict. Finally, &sect; 940.25(2)(a) did not unconstitutionally shift the State's burden of proof to defendant, but rather set forth an affirmative defense. The affirmative defense did not shift to defendant the burden of proving that he was innocent. Rather, it required him to prove that despite the fact that the State had satisfied the elements of the offense, he could not be held legally responsible under the statute. The statute did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In September 2003, the trial court signed an order committing respondent to the Department pursuant to ch. 980. On appeal, respondent claimed that ch. 980 was unconstitutional because its definition of &quot;dangerousness&quot; lacked &quot;a temporal context&quot; limited to &quot;imminent danger.&quot; The court found that the Wisconsin Supreme Court had many opportunities to invalidate ch. 980. The court assumed that it did not do so because it did not find the statutory definition of &quot;dangerous&quot; objectionable. Moreover, in the context of ch. 51 commitments, it rejected precisely the &quot;imminence&quot; requirement that respondent advocated. Because mentally disordered sex offenders presented a much greater threat to the public than those committed under ch. 51, the State of Wisconsin had an even greater interest in rejecting an &quot;imminence&quot; requirement in the ch. 980 context. Wis. ch. 980 was not vague just because the legislature did not limit the &quot;foreseeable future&quot; to an arbitrary period of time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant veteran's post appealed an order dismissing its claim for relocation benefits in appellee city redevelopment authority's eminent-domain proceeding. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) granted the authority's motion for summary judgment, because, inter alia, the comparable-replacement-property claim was barred under claim-preclusion because it had been decided by another court's order granting a writ of assistance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, the post argued that the instant trial court erred when it concluded that the post's comparable-replacement-property claim was barred under the doctrine of claim-preclusion. The post sought replacement property &quot;comparable&quot; to its leasehold interest, which, it valued as encompassing its right to pay only $1 per year in rent. The appellate court agreed with the instant trial court that that contention was barred by claim-preclusion. The post could have but had not specifically argued that its $1-per-year rental agreement entitled it to some $ 900,000 more than the $ 300,000 awarded to it in the initial condemnation proceeding. Thus, under claim-preclusion principles it could not do so on appeal. Moreover, the comparable-replacement-property issue had been raised before another court during a writ-of-assistance proceeding. That court ruled, as a predicate to granting the writ, that the authority had offered the post comparable replacement property, despite the post's leasehold right to pay only $1 per year in rent. The appellate court also held that the $ 50,000 limit on business-replacement damages under Wis. Stat. &sect; 32.19(4m)(a) did not violate Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient filed suit in the Circuit Court for La Crosse County (Wisconsin) against, inter alia, defendant doctor alleging medical malpractice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient argued, inter alia, that the circuit court erred in setting aside the verdict and ordering a new trial based on the dictionary definition of &quot;neglect&quot; brought into the jury room by a juror because the doctor did not make a sufficient preliminary showing to entitle him to an evidentiary hearing at which the jurors testified. The court of appeals disagreed. According to a paralegal's affidavit, the information the juror shared with the other jurors was not his understanding of what negligence meant based on his own experiences. Rather, he read the definition he found in a dictionary. A specific dictionary definition of a word--even a common word--was not the type of general knowledge or accumulated life experiences that jurors were expected to possess. In addition, the only reasonable inference from the jurors' statements in the affidavit was that the dictionary definition the juror read was not part of the trial record but was the result of the juror's independent consultation of a dictionary. Therefore, the dictionary definition of &quot;neglect,&quot; that was brought to the jury room and read aloud by another juror, was &quot;extraneous information.&quot;</SPAN></P>

A reasonable person would not have felt free to drive away. As such, defendant was seized for Fourth Amendment purposes. However, the appellate court agreed that the officer had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant based on an informants' tip. As the informant made clear that he personally witnessed the information he was reporting, was not completely anonymous as he approached the officer face-to-face, the appellate court found that the manner in which the tip was conveyed supported its reliability. Further, there were sufficient indicia of reliability to support the informant's tip, independent of any police corroboration. As such, suppression of the evidence was improper.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court concluded that the petitioner was barred because he was not entitled to pursue habeas corpus relief, and that the petition was barred because the petitioner had filed the same or similar claims in prior postconviction filings and they had been denied. Caselaw provided that all grounds for postconviction relief must be presented in the original postconviction motion and successive motions and appeals, which could have been brought were barred unless there was a sufficient reason for the failure to raise the claims in the original postconviction or appellate proceedings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pleaded no contest in the Circuit Court for Sauk County (Wisconsin) to two counts of second-degree sexual assault of a child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to withdraw his plea. The court of appeals disagreed. Initially, the court of appeals determined that the plea colloquy was inadequate in that it did not establish the petitioner's understanding of the element &quot;sexual contact or sexual intercourse,&quot; and therefore he established a prima facie case for plea withdrawal. However, the motion was properly denied because the fact that the trial court might have misapplied the burden did not require a remand for it to make findings of fact using the proper burden. Counsel specifically stated that he and the petitioner discussed the statutory definition of &quot;sexual contact,&quot; including the gratification aspect. In addition, counsel from an earlier case testified at the hearing that he had discussed with the &quot;sexual contact&quot; element in that case, including the sexual gratification part, and that the petitioner was present when the jury was read the instruction that included that definition. The testimony did not appear inherently incredible or internally inconsistent so as to compel rejection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff health clubs sought review an order from the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which denied their motions for summary judgment and awarded summary judgment to defendants, Young Men's Christian Associations (YMCAs), the Wisconsin Department of Revenue, and the Secretary of Revenue, in an action challenging the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.11(12)(a) (2003-04), which exempted from taxation property owned by the YMCAs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clubs brought a suit against defendants, challenging the constitutionality of a portion of &sect; 70.11(12)(a), which exempted from taxation property owned by the YMCAs. The clubs claimed that the statute violated the ban on private legislation in Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18 and the equal protection guarantees of the state and federal constitutions. The trial court denied the clubs' motions for summary judgment and granted defendants' motions for summary judgment. On appeal, the court concluded that the legislature adequately considered the bill and, thus, the bill was entitled to a presumption of constitutionality. Further, because the YMCAs were located in communities throughout Wisconsin and their programs served thousands of individuals, whether they were exempt from taxation was an issue of statewide dimension. Because the challenged part of &sect; 70.11(12) was not private legislation beyond a reasonable doubt, it did not violate Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18. The YMCA exemption did not contravene the equal protection guarantees of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The clubs and the YMCAs were not similarly situated. The YMCAs were benevolent organizations; the clubs were for-profit businesses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mother sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin), which terminated her parental rights to her child and held that she was not denied effective assistance of trial counsel in an action brought by petitioner, a county division of children and family services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The division filed a petition for the termination of the mother's parental rights to her child. The division also sought to terminate the parental rights of the child's father, who was incarcerated. The trial court found that termination of both parents' rights was in the child's best interest. The case was later remanded to the trial court to address the mother's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The trial court found that counsel was not ineffective. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not lose competency to proceed when the factfinding hearing was set beyond the 45-day requirement in Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.422(2) (2003-04). Good cause in the record, pursuant to &sect; 48.315(2), supported the continuance, and the delay did not exceed what was necessary to accommodate the parties' competing interests and schedules. Further, the mother's plea to the petition was freely and knowingly made. The mother's trial counsel rendered reasonably effective representation. There was no reason to vacate the termination order in the interest of justice. Finally, evidence of the mother's efforts to meet the conditions of return was not wrongly excluded at the dispositional hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order denying his postconviction motion. He claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion, which asserted that Wis. Stat. ch. 980 (2003-04) was unconstitutional as applied to African-Americans in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, and that he should have been entitled to a jury trial at each recommitment level. The appellate court noted that defendant's argument that the statutes governing Wis. Stat. ch. 980 (2003-04) cases were unconstitutional as applied to African-Americans was meritless because he did not explain how the statute discriminated against African-Americans and otherwise violated their constitutional rights. The appellate court held that defendant's petition and motion did not assert that his condition had changed so as to warrant a hearing; rather, it was simply another petition in a series of filings, which was rightfully denied as frivolous by the trial court. The appellate court concluded that there was no basis to extend the Confrontation Clause to a trial court's review of psychological reports and records for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a discharge hearing, which was a civil commitment proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The charges alleged that the firefighter used and possessed cocaine and marijuana, lied to investigators, acted in a way that would bring the fire department into disrepute, failed to report violations of fire department rules to a superior officer, and distributed cocaine. The board found that the firefighter had committed the violations and, with respect to each, imposed a 90-day unpaid suspension and a reduction in rank. The suspensions were ordered to run concurrently. The trial court upheld the board's decision. On appeal, the firefighter argued that the rules under which he was disciplined were unconstitutionally vague as applied. The court found that the record did not show that the fire department or the board failed to previously apply the disputed rules to identified instances of off-duty conduct. The firefighter failed to show that the board allowed off-duty rule violations to go undisciplined.

On June 25, the mother moved for an adjournment and substitution of counsel. The State objected to any substitution that would further delay the trial and asserted that an adjournment would not be in the best interests of the children; the court agreed and denied the motion. The jury found the children were abused and neglected and in need of protection and services. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's denial of the adjournment under Wis.

Stat. &sect; 74.37 (2003-04), appellant outdoor advertising company challenged a decision of a circuit court (Wisconsin), which concluded that the company's billboards would be assessed at full market value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When respondent city began placing limits on the number of allowable outdoor signs, the company procured an appraisal estimating the value of its signs using the &quot;cost less depreciation&quot; approach, and the city adopted this appraisal. During the two tax years at issue, the assessor utilized the income approach rejecting the &quot;cost less depreciation&quot; approach. The company contended that the method violated the Uniformity Clause of Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The court certified the question to the Wisconsin Supreme Court because there was no direct controlling authority on the question of whether the &quot;income&quot; method or the &quot;cost less depreciation&quot; method was a permissible method for valuing personal property for purposes of the personal property tax when there was no recent sale of the subject property or reasonably comparable sales of other properties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the circuit court for Fond du Lac County (Wisconsin) that convicted him of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, fourth offense, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a) (2003-2004). Defendant challenged the denial of his motions to suppress evidence on grounds that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to stop him or probable cause to arrest him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the denial of his motions to suppress, claiming the officer did not have probable cause to stop him because bad weather, darkness and construction combined to produce conditions anyone might have found challenging, and thus the stop was unreasonable; and that he was arrested before sobriety tests were administered. The court noted that although police officers were not required to rule out the possibility of innocent behavior before initiating a brief stop, the officer in this case did not have to consider that possibility because he observed defendant driving in the wrong lane in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.05, and the bad conditions did not diminish the reasonableness of the officer's decision to stop defendant. The court held that, regardless of whether defendant was arrested at the time he was placed in the squad car to go back to the station to finish the sobriety tests due to the bad weather or at the station, probable cause existed for his arrest based on the officer's observation of defendant's driving in the wrong lane, his slurred speech and glossy, bloodshot, and dilated eyes, and his admission that he had been drinking less than two hours before.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which denied his postconviction motion for sentence modification. Appellant raised a series of arguments challenging the repeater portion of his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with recklessly causing his girlfriend's death on July 22, 2001. Appellant acknowledged that he had been convicted of forgery on April 13, 1995, incarcerated until May 2, 1996, and had subsequently spent another 83 days in custody for that offense due to parole violations. Appellant argued that his admissions were insufficient to establish that he had been convicted of a felony within the immediately preceding five-year period because he was actually adjudged guilty of the forgery charge on January 23, 1995, when he entered a plea in that case. The court disagreed. It noted that once a written judgment of conviction had been entered, that document was properly used to establish the date of a prior conviction for purposes of the repeater statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.62(2) (2003-04). The relevant five-year period extended from May 2, 1996, to May 2, 2001, regardless of the fact that one of those years was a leap year. Adding an additional 83 days for time served in relation to parole revocations extended the time period to July 24, 2001. Because appellant committed his offense two days before this time period expired, he was properly sentenced as a repeat offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was cited for littering pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 287.81(2)(a) (2001-02). He was a self-described &quot;artist,&quot; and he released over 80 ceramic balls into the Wisconsin River. The Circuit Court for Sauk County, Wisconsin, denied his motion to dismiss the citation. Defendant appealed, asserting that the objects were not &quot;solid waste&quot; under &sect; 287.81(2)(a) or, in the alternative, that said statute was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant imprinted the subject ceramic balls with various information, purportedly as some type of artistic or communicative endeavor. The circuit court determined that they were salvageable materials under Wis. Stat. &sect; 287.81(2)(a) (2001-02) because they were capable of being &quot;saved for further use.&quot; The appellate court impliedly agreed with the circuit court and went on to note that the primary policy concern of Wis. Stat. ch. 287 (2001-02) was that maximum solid waste reduction was in the best interest of the State in order to protect the quality of the natural environment. In short, a material was salvageable if it was capable of being extracted as valuable or as having further usefulness. Said ceramic balls were salvageable, and defendant's depositing same into the river was a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 287.81 (2001-02). Secondly, the appellate court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 287.81 was unconstitutionally vague for lack of &quot;proper notice&quot; and an &quot;objective standard for enforcement.&quot; A common meaning of &quot;salvageable&quot; included defendant's objects, and the Wisconsin Legislature had given authorities minimal guidelines to determine what behavior violated the statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's husband testified that he felt he had no choice but to retrieve his wife from inside their home. On the other hand, he had not raised any objections to the officer's request. Defendant agreed to talk to the officer and she admitted that she had been driving the car. The appellate court held: (1) defendant was not &quot;seized&quot; so as to have invoked the protections of the Fourth Amendment where she had submitted herself to questioning by the officer; (2) she was not &quot;seized&quot; by the police, with her husband acting as their agent, again, since she consented to the encounter with the officer, and because under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would have believed they were free to remain within their home; and (3) defendant was not &quot;in custody&quot; where most of the questioning occurred outside her home, and where she was never told she was under arrest and she was not handcuffed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the trial court's finding that the State struck a juror for non-discriminatory reasons was not clearly erroneous. The State's explanation that it struck the prospective juror based on her comment or question to defense counsel during voir dire, which the prosecutor interpreted as demonstrating a predisposition to believe defendant's version of events, met the requirement that the State proffer a plausible, non-discriminatory reasons for its strike. So long as the trial court found the prosecutor's explanation credible, which it did, the court did not err in rejecting defendant's Batson challenge.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the plea was valid, even if defendant did not understand that dismissed charges would be treated as read-ins. Because read-ins did not increase the range of punishment, they were indirect consequences, and knowledge of them was not required for a defendant to enter a knowing, intelligent, or voluntary plea. Finally, defendant did not establish that her plea was coerced by showing that a prosecutor with no jurisdiction over the docket would have resisted her request for a trial postponement due to problems with a pregnancy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Responder, a city board of police and fire commissioners, found that as a result of a police investigation, appellant firefighter had continually used and possessed cocaine over a 12-year period, had distributed cocaine on several occasions, and had aided in its manufacture on one occasion. The board discharged the firefighter. He appealed, and the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) affirmed the board. The firefighter appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firefighter made an as-applied vagueness challenge. He claimed that the board's previous application of the rules failed to give him fair notice that his off-duty conduct was a violation of the rules and subjected him to removal as a firefighter. To conclude that a rule was unconstitutionally vague as applied required a record that showed that the past application of the rules would have led a person to believe that the conduct at issue was not subject to the discipline imposed. In the case at bar, the record did not show that the fire department or the board failed to previously apply the disputed rules to identified instances of off-duty conduct. The only significant evidence the firefighter pointed to was testimony before the board by a fire department lieutenant whose testimony did not show that, under the rules, previous off-duty drug violations were not subject to discipline. The record did not reflect that someone engaging in conduct comparable to the firefighter's was or was not discharged. The appellate court held that under the rules, the firefighter could have reasonably expected that dismissal was within the range of authorized penalties for his rule violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for operating a motor vehicle with &quot;a detectable amount of a restricted controlled substance&quot; in his blood, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(am) (2003-04), in the Circuit Court for Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin. He appealed, asserting that the statute exceeded the scope of the Wisconsin Legislature's police power and thus violated the constitutional guarantees of due process, fundamental fairness, and equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(am) (2003-04), which required only proof of &quot;a detectable amount&quot; of a banned substance and not proof of impairment, represented an unconstitutional overstep by the Wisconsin Legislature in the exercise of its police power. That overstep, he submitted, violated his rights to due process and fundamental fairness. However, the appellate court found defendant did not shoulder his heavy burden of demonstrating unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. Indisputably, regulating the safety of Wisconsin roadways was a proper exercise of the police power. The appellate court held that the per se ban on driving or operating a motor vehicle with a detectable amount of a restricted controlled substance in one's blood, as set out in &sect; 346.63(1)(am), bore a reasonable and rational relationship to the latter goal and was not fundamentally unfair, such that there was no due process violation. The appellate court also held that the statute did not offend principles of equal protection since defendant did not establish that the statute either interfered with a fundamental right or operated to the peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner probationer sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which affirmed the revocation of his parole and probation and also denied his motion for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the affirmation of the revocation of the probationer's parole and probation, the appellate court affirmed. The administrative law judge was persuaded that the hearsay was reliable pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 911.01(4)(c) (2003-04), and the court concluded that its findings were supported by substantial evidence. The probation/parole agent testified that she called the probationer's aunt, who arranged for the probationer's cousin to call the agent, and that the cousin told the agent that he had not asked the probationer to install a car stereo. This was certainly plausible, despite the probationer's assertions that his cousin was lying to avoid becoming involved. Moreover, even without the hearsay, there was sufficient evidence to support the findings. A reasonable factfinder could have concluded that a man walking the streets at 3:30 in the morning, in possession of burglar's tools and a used car stereo, was not actually intending to install a car stereo in the middle of the night. The fact that the probationer was driven to the home he was supposed to be walking to and the homeowner said that the cousin no longer lived there only bolstered such a finding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city annexed respondent developer's land and created a tax incremental financing (TIF) district. The land was zoned as light industrial, and the developer's project plan was approved. Appellants, certain taxpayers and the town where the land was located before the annexation, challenged the TIF district.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the taxpayers and the town contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred in accepting the joint review board's finding that the expected development in the district would not occur without use of the tax incremental financing and erred in construing the &quot;not less than 50 percent&quot; requirement in Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.1105(4)(gm)4.a (2001-02) as it related to industrial use. The appellate court found that because the complaint did not name the joint review board as a defendant, the trial court properly granted summary judgment on this issue. Further, the city's finding under &sect; 66.1105(4)(gm)4.a. was based on a proper construction of the statute: the policy of encouraging and promoting the development of industry was furthered by requiring that one of the categories making up at least 50 percent of the district was property that was suitable for industrial use and zoned for that use in order for the municipality to have the benefit of TIF for public improvements and development assistance. This requirement promoted the development of industrial uses over other types of land use, even though it did not promote the development of industrial uses to the exclusion of other uses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Marathon County, Wisconsin, convicting him of attempted first-degree intentional homicide and four counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety by use of a dangerous weapon, with a penalty enhancer on the reckless endangerment counts as criminal gang crimes contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 940.01(1)(a), 939.32, 939.63, 941.30(1) (2003-2004) and 939.625 (2001-2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from an incident at a party in which members of the first gang were involved in a fight with a member of a second gang. A first gang member allegedly stabbed a second gang member. Witnesses told police that defendant fired a gun five times into the crowd, hitting three people. Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to preclude the State from referring to him by his nickname, &quot;Shotgun.&quot; The appellate court ruled that although use of the nickname &quot;Shotgun&quot; at trial could have been prejudicial, it was not unfairly so. The record demonstrated that many of the witnesses had nicknames, and witnesses would inevitably have referred to defendant by his nickname because that was the only name by which they knew him. Further, defense witnesses explained that &quot;Shotgun&quot; was the name of defendant's tattoo business, and perhaps the name of a style of tattoos. Also, a reasonable jury could find that defendant's words and conduct in conjunction with the first gang's battering and stabbing someone they believed was a rival gang member were sufficient to prove defendant's intent to promote or assist the first gang's criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

As part of the disposition, the Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, entered an order compelling him to provide a DNA sample to the Wisconsin Department of Justice pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 938.34(15) (2003-04). Respondent appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent argued that it was arbitrary, and therefore a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, to require a DNA sample from delinquent juveniles who had been convicted of fourth-degree sexual assault, while excusing similarly convicted adults and waived juveniles from providing a sample under identical circumstances. The court disagreed, finding that the requirement for juveniles was rationally related to two stated goals of the Juvenile Justice Code, specifically protection of the public and prevention of delinquency. Further, expansion of the DNA databank served the purpose of aiding in the identification of perpetrators of crime. Finally, the significant differences between the juvenile and adult justice systems provided a rational basis for the dissimilar classification. The court also found that respondent, by failing to file a reply brief countering the State's arguments, conceded that he failed to file a timely notice of appeal challenging the circuit court's denial of his request for a stay of the DNA requirement. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.83(2), the delay was grounds for dismissal of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had previously been serving a life sentence in Nevada. During that period he was also convicted of a crime in Wisconsin. He brought a habeas corpus action in the Circuit Court for Winnebago County, Wisconsin, claiming that his Wis. Stat. ch. 980 commitment as a sexually violent person was unconstitutional because it violated the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD). The circuit court rejected his request for discharge. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the time appellant was serving his Wisconsin sentence, the Nevada authorities had periodically wrote to the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, reminding them that he was still under parole supervision in Nevada and that Nevada was to be informed of any impending release of appellant. When he was scheduled for mandatory release from his Wisconsin sentences, the State of Wisconsin commenced the commitment proceeding. The appellate court held that appellant's waiver of extradition and the IAD expressly gave Wisconsin the right to his custody to serve his Wisconsin sentence. At the completion of that sentence, the scope and purpose of his waiver of extradition and the IAD were satisfied and completed. Nothing in his waiver of extradition or the IAD governed or guaranteed future events. Specifically, he had no right or legitimate expectation that he would be returned to Nevada upon the completion of his Wisconsin sentence. Similarly, he had no right or legitimate expectation of immunization from potential commitment proceedings under Wis. Stat. ch. 980. Thus, his waiver of extradition and the IAD did not bar the Wis. Stat. ch. 980 commitment proceedings against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the circuit court's order denying appellant habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a guilty plea, the Circuit Court for Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, convicted defendant of possession of cocaine and possession of marijuana, both as party to a crime and as a habitual offender. Defendant appealed the denial of his motion to suppress evidence collected during the search of a vehicle in which he was a passenger.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the vehicle and its occupants were unconstitutionally detained on a hunch after a speeding ticket was issued, completing the purpose of the stop. The court disagreed, concluding that the officers provided specific, articulable facts to support the reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot and thus to justify the continued detention under the Fourth Amendment and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Specifically, the driver had red, glassy eyes, an odor of incense emanated from the vehicle, the officer's experience was that air fresheners could be used to mask the odor of marijuana, and the occupants of the vehicle were acting nervous. Although a preliminary breath test established that alcohol was not the reason for the driver's red, glassy eyes, an officer testified that marijuana was another likely cause. The court also found that the officers had probable cause to search the vehicle because the odor of burnt marijuana created an inference that marijuana was physically present and had been smoked recently. Other facts to support probable cause included the presence of air fresheners and the red and glassy eyes and nervous demeanors of the occupants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of conviction and the order denying the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Iowa County, Wisconsin, convicting her of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI), third offense, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a) (2001-2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that her current conviction should not be treated as a third offense because her second conviction was unconstitutionally obtained. Defendant alleged that in the prior proceeding she was denied, and did not waive, her constitutional right to an attorney. Defendant's motion to collaterally attack her prior OWI conviction was denied by the circuit court because it concluded that defendant had failed to make a prima facie case that her right to counsel had been violated. After the circuit court denied the motion, defendant proceeded to a stipulated trial. The appellate court ruled that defendant made a prima facie showing of a constitutional violation of her right to counsel. Rather than address defendant's assertion that she did not waive counsel at all, the circuit court reviewed the case law and concluded that defendant's waiver of counsel was valid. In effect, the circuit court assumed waiver without resolving whether any waiver took place. The appellate court stated that the circuit court would have to assess defendant's credibility, and make a factual finding on the topic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents' medical malpractice suit alleging their newborn son's brain damage was caused by defendant hospital's negligence resulted in a no causation verdict. The Circuit Court for Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, granted the parents a new trial on the issue of causation because of confusion caused by the jury instructions. The second trial resulted in a verdict for the parents, awarding them damages. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the hospital claimed the trial court erred in granting the parents a new trial and in awarding past medical expenses. The parents challenged the amount of post-verdict interest and the cap on noneconomic damages. The appellate court determined that a new trial was warranted as the jury found the hospital's negligence was not causal but then was entered damages caused by the hospital's treatment; this inconsistency could only have arisen from jury confusion as to the instructions. Causation was a critical inquiry because of the progressive development of the son's condition, and the omitted causation paragraph would have provided the jury with critical information on that inquiry. The appellate court also held that post-verdict interest ran from the first jury verdict. Further, because the jury did not exclude the past medical expenses paid by collateral sources, the parents were entitled to judgment for those sums. Finally, reducing noneconomic damages by the statutory cap in Wis. Stat. &sect; 655.017 (2003-04) was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection guarantees of the Wisconsin Constitution as per a recent Wisconsin Supreme Court decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed in part and remanded with directions that judgment be entered in favor of the parents in an amount not reduced by the cap on noneconomic damages and to include post-verdict interest the first jury verdict. Otherwise, the judgment was affirmed. The parents were awarded appeal costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for burglary and cocaine possession with intent to deliver in the Circuit Court for Pepin County, Wisconsin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State conceded the third (and final) PSI contained inaccurate information. However, it contended the trial court properly struck the sexual assault conviction and pending bail jumping charge. It also argued that the trial court properly considered two juvenile adjudications where defendant was not represented by counsel. The appellate court noted that defendant's accurate criminal record, which did not include the sexual assault conviction or pending bail jumping charges, was lengthy. Thus, the trial court did not have to rely on inaccurate information to reach its conclusion. Secondly, even though the trial court essentially adopted the PSIs sentencing recommendation, the trial court did not demonstrate that it relied on inaccuracies. The two unrepresented juvenile adjudications should not have been included in the PSI; however, the trial court was nevertheless entitled to consider those adjudications. Finally, while defendant was not per se ineligible for an earned release program, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying same based on his criminal history, and his sentence, within the statutory limits, did not conflict with Blakely v. Washington.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court determined that the four-part test found in a previous case was the method by which the appellate court determined whether there was a legitimate penological interest. The prisoner alleged the broad outlines of the no-publications policy as it applied to him, but the actual policy was not before the appellate court. It could not be determined from only the face of the complaint what the employees' precise policy was and whether it was reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.

Defendant also acknowledged that the trial court could sentence him to the maximum possible term.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant client appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, that awarded attorney fees to respondents, her former law firm and counsel, in her divorce action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the course of her divorce proceeding, the client was represented by respondents. Following the trial court's entry of the judgment of divorce and the resolution of the financial issues, respondents moved to withdraw citing difficulty in their communication with the client. At the time respondents moved to withdraw, there was still pending a trial for resolution of the custody issues. Respondents also requested a judgment against the client in the amount of $14,768 in attorney fees at the time they moved to withdraw. The client did not immediately hire a new attorney to represent her in the action. In reviewing Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.23(3)(a) (2003-04), the appellate court held that &sect; 767.23(3)(a) gave the trial court in an action affecting the family the authority to enter a judgment for the fees owed by the client to an attorney who was permitted by order of the court to withdraw, regardless of when or if the client retained another attorney to replace the withdrawing attorney in that action. Thus, the award of attorney fees was affirmed even though the client did not immediately hire a new attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a decision of the Circuit Court for Barron County, Wisconsin, defendants, an insured and his insurer, appealed a portion of a judgment awarding punitive damages to plaintiff injured person for a car accident that occurred when the insured was driving while drunk (he was a repeat offender). The insured asserted the award was so excessive that it violated his due process rights under the United States and Wisconsin Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to the instant case, previously, the instant court had certified questions to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The supreme court had remanded the case on the question of whether the punitive damages award violated the insured's due process rights. At trial, the jury had found that the insured had acted with intentional disregard. Further, although the injured person had been awarded only $ 2,000 in compensatory damages, the jury awarded $225,000 in punitive damages. The appellate court applied the guideposts set forth in BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore State, the clarification of same set forth in Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, and the similar Wisconsin test set forth in Trinity Evangelical Luth. Ch. v. Tower Ins., to determine whether the award in the case at bar was constitutional. The appellate court held that like the award in Trinity, the punitive damage award in the instant case served a legitimate state interest in punishment and deterrence in its own jurisdiction. Further, the degree of reprehensibly was the most important factor in any excessiveness inquiry, and the conduct in the case qualified as egregious. Thus, the award was not grossly excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant offered to pay a woman, who was actually an undercover police officer, a sum of money for sex. He was subsequently convicted for solicitation in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. He appealed, asserting that there was no proof of what he meant by offering to pay &quot;for sex&quot; and, therefore, the intent element of solicitation for prostitution was not established. He also raised constitutional arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In part, defendant argued that his reference to &quot;sex&quot; could have been a reference to, for example, &quot;phone sex.&quot; Thus, he asserted that if all he was exploring was whether the woman was willing to call him later that day and make obscene remarks, there was no violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.30. However, the circumstances included defendant circling the block numerous times, and then asking the officer if she was a cop. He then made a proposal of sex for $20. The officer testified that, based on her experience, a prostitute in the vicinity typically charged $20 for sexual intercourse. The appellate court noted the trial court properly found that it could have inferred defendant's intent from his words and actions. If the test had been otherwise, a defendant could always defeat a solicitation charge by testifying that his or her subjective intent, when offering money &quot;for sex,&quot; was really to take the other person to a movie or to dinner. Finally, &sect; 944.30 was not unconstitutionally vague because a factfinder had to consider all of the surrounding facts and circumstances; merely uttering the word &quot;sex&quot; would not be sufficient to sustain a conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for exposing a child to harmful materials and second-degree sexual assault. On appeal, the court affirmed the sexual assault convictions, stating that it was satisfied that the trial court properly ruled that, under the rape shield law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 972.11(2) (2003-04), the presence of semen found on the vaginal swabs and the victim's underwear was not admissible because defendant failed to satisfy all five of the Pulizzano factors. The court was also satisfied that the trial court properly exercised its discretion under the doctrine of completeness when it permitted the State to read the victim's initial statement given to the police to the jury. However, the court concluded that insufficient evidence was presented to the jury to prove the two counts of exposing a child to harmful materials and, as a result, those convictions were reversed and the matter remanded. The trial court failed to determine that the tape in question was patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what was suitable for children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant reinsurance corporation, a reinsurer of town mutual insurance companies, appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) affirming a $ 15,047 assessment against the reinsurer by appellee Wisconsin Insurance Security Fund (Fund) and dismissing an action alleging procedural infirmities. The reinsurer contended that the Fund exceeded its statutory grant of authority by its assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, the Fund asserted that Wis. Stat. &sect; 646.31(2)(a)1. (2001-02) permitted town mutuals to submit claims to the Fund, and consequently subjected the insurers of town mutuals to assessment under Wis. Stat. &sect; 646.51(3)(am)2. Because the reinsurer and the Fund each offered reasonable interpretations of Wis. Stat. &sect; 646.31(2)(a), the statute was ambiguous. The court therefore turned to extrinsic sources to ascertain the statute's meaning. The court agreed with the Fund's contention that the 1979 comment and 1987 legislative reference bureau (LRB) analysis clarified that under &sect; 646.31(2)(a), a town mutual ceding certain risks with a reinsurer could make a claim with the Fund for those risks if the reinsurer went into liquidation. Accordingly, under the assessment scheme of Wis. Stat. ch. 646, the Fund had the authority to assess reinsurance companies of town mutuals, an authority it had to exercise to ensure the Fund's solvency. The legislative history of the statute showed the intent to permit assessment of the reinsurer. The reinsurer waived most of its objections to the Fund's procedures, and those procedural objections it had not waived were rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before moving to a new building, the corporation applied for a permit to construct a new sign. The county denied the application because the proposed sign did not comply with the ordinance, Burnett County, Wis., Ordinance No. 2000-01. The ordinance did not include a variance procedure. The corporation argued that the county ordinance violated its right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The appellate court noted that the county's only response to the corporation's constitutional argument was that certiorari provided an adequate post-deprivation remedy. The county effectively conceded the two premises of the corporation's argument: it was deprived of a constitutionally protected property interest, and due process of law was not provided before the deprivation. Because the ordinance had no variance or exception procedure, there was no hearing to present evidence or arguments. There was no relief a certiorari court could even consider.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin) entered a judgment of divorce. Appellant mother challenged that portion of the judgment awarding the parties equal physical placement of their child and requiring her to make a $ 7,500 contribution to appellee father's attorney fees based on overtrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the commencement of its placement decision, the trial court noted its concern for the young child being overexposed to the hostility between the parents, particularly during transitions between parents. Restricting transitions was a goal of the placement arrangement. Implicit was the finding that transitions at the day care, which would occur on two of the three required transitions, would be easier for the child because there would be little interparental contact. Further, there was evidence that placement in day care was good for the child. In addition, the trial court found that the child was able to adjust to both parental environments. Furthermore, the proper factors were taken into consideration. Thus, the placement decision was a proper exercise of discretion. With regards to the overtrial, the mother's overall lack of candor with the trial court permeated the entire trial. Also, the record supported the trial court's finding that with respect to the financial matters the mother engaged in unreasonable litigation. However, the trial court failed to make the required finding that the amount of attorney fees awarded - $ 7,500 - was reasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the child placement decision, but reversed the contribution award and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings on the contribution award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Walworth County (Wisconsin), which convicted her of possession of tetrahydrocannabinols (THC or marijuana), contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 961.41(3g)(e), and carrying a concealed weapon, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.23. On appeal, defendant contended that the search of his vehicle violated his Fourth Amendment rights and that all evidence obtained in that search should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was one of three people involved in a minor traffic accident. Defendant was belligerent and uncooperative after the other two people called police to the scene. The officer requested permission to search defendant's vehicle. Defendant twice refused to give the officer permission to search the vehicle, but defendant said he would not prevent the search. The officer then failed to advise defendant that he could refuse consent to the search of his vehicle's console. Upon opening the console, the officer noticed the barrel of a gun. On appeal, the court concluded that the officer's warrantless search of defendant's vehicle, without defendant's unequivocal consent, violated the Fourth Amendment. Furthermore, the search of a vehicle included the search of the console, and, therefore, the officer's search of the console of defendant's vehicle was tainted by the original illegal act. Finally, the court held that any consent from defendant to search the console was invalid; no intervening event attenuated the illegal vehicle search from the console search.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin), which sustained defendant's objection to the introduction of videotaped statements of two child witnesses in a sexual assault trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action arose when the State, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 908.08 (2003-04), sought to introduce the videotaped statements of two child witnesses in a sexual assault trial in lieu of full-blown live direct examination and to subsequently make the children available for questioning at the defendant's request. The trial court sustained defendant's objection to this mode of testimonial presentation, observing that in its past experience, child witnesses sometimes refused to submit to cross-examination, thereby necessitating a mistrial in order to avert a violation of defendant's Sixth Amendment right. Invoking Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 904.03, 906.11 and 908.08(3) (2003-04), the trial court required any live testimony to occur first. The court reversed and remanded with instructions, stating that what was really at issue was the separation of legislative and judicial powers. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 908.08 represented a proper exercise of legislative power and that the statute was not trumped by Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 904.03 and 906.11. Thus, the trial court was not permitted to dictate alternative procedures based on the mere specter of a possible Crawford violation in the future.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) found defendant guilty of two counts of second-degree sexual assault of a child, Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02(2). After the trial court improperly sentenced defendant, on resentencing, the trial court imposed the maximum, 10 years of imprisonment on each count, to run consecutively. Subsequently, the trial court denied his motion for postconviction relief. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although defendant was arrested some five to five-and-one-half years after he allegedly last assaulted the victim, that, standing alone, did not make the charges constitutionally insufficient. Also, although the charged acts of sexual assault were alleged to have happened over five-and-one-half month and four-and-one-half month time periods, defendant was sufficiently informed of the charges against him. Thus, the complaint was not constitutionally insufficient. Additionally, defendant's alleged crimes were different in fact; thus, the charges were not multiplicitous. In addition, other-acts evidence was permissible to show the context of the crime and provide an explanation of the case, and to show a plan. Furthermore, the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by any unfair prejudice to defendant. Finally, the trial court considered the appropriate factors and explained why maximum consecutive sentences were warranted because the trial court (1) considered the devastating effect that the assaults had on the victim and his family; and (2) determined that defendant needed to be punished, and that the community needed to be protected from further assaults.</SPAN></P>

However, the State drew the blood before charging defendant, and therefore before his right to counsel accrued. In any event, the State obtained the sample pursuant to a search warrant, and he did not challenge the probable cause determination thereon. The appellate court also rejected his claim that the State withheld photographs of the victim that would have impeached testimony that she came away from their encounter with visible bruises, and that counsel failed to raise the issue. In that respect, the photographs were not of record. His claim that they are exculpatory rested on nothing more than his conclusory allegation. Defendant also contended that counsel should have called a police detective to testify he did not observe the physical injuries that other witnesses attributed to the victim. However, the officer had testified that he never looked for said injuries. Finally, defendant's assertion that counsel was ineffective for making inappropriate remarks at closing, as to the &quot;despicable&quot; nature of defendant's act, in no way undermined the defense, where same was based on consent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Wisconsin Department of Transportation (DOT) challenged a decision from the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which entered judgment in favor of appellee builders in an action concerning a dispute over administrative regulations that concerned land abutting public highways.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The builders contended that the DOT did not have authority to review all land divisions for property abutting public highways. The circuit court agreed. It also held that the setback restrictions and special exception conditions under Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Transp. 233.08(3n) and Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Transp. 233.11(3)(d) were unconstitutional takings. The DOT then sought review. On appeal, the court determined that the DOT failed to show that any statute gave it the authority to promulgate rules that applied to all land divisions abutting highways. Wis. Stat. &sect; 236.03(1) (2003-04) only applied to local units of government, so the DOT did not have the authority to regulate land divisions that were not subdivisions. Further, Wis. Stat. ch. 84 related only to the DOT's authority regarding the supervision and expenditure of federal and state highway funds. Next, Wis. Stat. &sect; 85.02(1), 86.07(2) (2003-04) did not give the DOT the authority it asserted. Finally, the court rejected the argument that Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Transp. 233.08(3n) and Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Transp. 233.11(3)(d) were unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment or Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision that the DOT did not have the statutory authority to review all land divisions for property abutting public highways, but it reversed the decision that the regulations in question were unconstitutional takings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pleaded no contest in the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin) to attempted armed robbery and a pleaded guilty several counts of second degree reckless endangerment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by accepted her pleas of guilty and no contest without conducting a personal colloquy to ensure that she waived her not guilty by reason of insanity (NGI) plea knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently. The court of appeals disagreed. The petitioner had no right to insist on a personal colloquy as a prerequisite to a valid plea withdrawal. Only fundamental constitutional rights warranted that special protection and an NGI pleas fell outside the realm of a fundamental right. At the time the petitioner entered her subsequent pleas, the trial court had no reason to doubt her sanity. The only doctor's report available clearly opined that she did not lack the mental capacity to commit the crimes charged and, moreover, demonstrated a rational comprehension of the proceedings at the time of the evaluation. That observation was consistent with counsel's testimony and the trial court's own observations. Counsel testified at the postconviction hearing that although he had concerns that county personnel were not adequately treating defendant's depression, he never had any reason to doubt that she understood the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment and an order of the circuit court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin) that convicted him of delivering 5 or fewer grams of cocaine, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 961.41(1)(cm)1 (1999-2000); sentenced him to a 12-year sentence with 7 years of initial confinement and 5 years of extended supervision, to be served consecutively to any other sentence; and that denied his motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the length of his sentence and the validity of the conditions of extended supervision that prohibited him from consuming or possessing alcohol or entering a liquor store or tavern.

The court held that the trial court had properly considered the three primary sentencing factors in arriving at the length of defendant's sentence. The court found that although the oral pronouncement of sentence may not have been perfectly clear, the written judgment of conviction and the conditions of extended supervision were crystal clear with respect to what conduct the conditions covered. Also the alcohol conditions were reasonably related to defendant's rehabilitative needs. The court held that defendant's challenge to the validity of the conditions was not premature under Wis. Stat &sect; 302.113(7m)(e)1 (2003-04), which required a defendant to wait until one year before his release to supervision before challenging the conditions, because &sect; 302.113(7m)(e)1 applied where an individual sought modification of an otherwise valid condition, not where he challenged its validity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State moved to terminate the parental rights of appellant father. The child, born in 1996, had never lived with the father. The father was incarcerated much of the time between 1996 and 2001. Later he was subject to an absconder warrant. A jury in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin found grounds to terminate the father's parental rights. The trial court ordered a termination order and the father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In effect, the father argued that he was denied due process and equal protection of the law. He asserted that he and the child's mother (her parental rights were also terminated), were treated differently during the children in need of protection and services (CHIPS) and termination of parental rights (TPR) proceedings. His two primary complaints were that he was not given adequate notice of hearings and that the mother was unfairly offered more social services. However, the alleged grounds for termination of his parental rights (in part, abandonment), did not include his failure to meet conditions of a CHIPS order. Thus, unlike with the mother, the State did not need to prove that it made reasonable efforts to assist him. Moreover, he did not identify the social services he wished he had received, or provide proof that he asked for services. In addition, the father admitted that he had never been in a room alone with the child or spent a night with him. The father did not identify how the denial of additional services or &quot;conditions to work on&quot; prevented him from establishing a relationship with his child. Thus, the father was not denied due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a town board (the town), asserted it had exclusive authority to name roads within the town and that respondent county's ordinance illegally infringed on its road naming authority. In the town's action for declaratory relief and an injunction, the Circuit Court for Door County, Wisconsin, dismissed its claims. The town appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By its plain language, former Wis. Stat. &sect; 81.01(11) (2001-02) required a town to assign a name to each road within the town's jurisdiction. On the other hand, the plain language of Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.54(4) (2003-04) (an enabling statute), gave counties discretionary authority to establish a rural naming or numbering system when the purpose of the system was to aid in fire protection, emergency services and civil defense. The statute also gave counties discretion to give each road a name or number and to &quot;cooperate with towns&quot; to implement the system. Thus, the appellate court held the town had initial authority to name town roads. However, the town's authority was subject to the county's discretionary authority, under &sect; 59.54(4). Ultimately, the county had authority to implement name changes, even if the town did not consent, when the name changes were made under the system pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.54 (2003-04). The appellate court found the county exceeded its authority as to one part of the ordinance that related to the &quot;efficient delivery of goods and services.&quot; However, that invalid portion of the ordinance was severable from the valid provisions at issue in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from an Internet sting operation.

Defendant argued that the circuit court erroneously admitted testimony on &quot;grooming techniques&quot; used by sexual predators. The appellate court ruled that the circuit court properly exercised its discretion by admitting testimony on grooming techniques. Defendant's intent was relevant, and the officer's testimony was relevant circumstantial evidence of defendant's intent. Defendant did not explain how the officer's testimony was unfairly prejudicial or how unfair prejudice substantially outweighed the testimony's probative value as circumstantial evidence of his intent. Also, defendant failed to show Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.07 was facially unconstitutional when applied to internet cases.

However, it had already been determined that the admission of the photograph by reason of the improper exploitation charge was harmless error and that the photograph would have otherwise been admissible. Further, the inmate failed to demonstrate what additional investigation or statements from witnesses would have revealed. In addition, the suggestion that the victim was not a virgin at the time of the assaults was totally without foundation and lacked any relevance to the allegations against the inmate since penetration was not alleged.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of one count of possession of marijuana after a police officer found marijuana and drug paraphernalia during the course of a traffic stop involving defendant, who was the driver, and a passenger. Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Portage County (Wisconsin) convicting her after denying her motion to suppress the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the circuit court erred when it denied her suppression motion. She argued that the initial stop was invalid and that the officer prolonged the stop without reasonable suspicion to have done so. The appellate court concluded that the initial stop was valid and that defendant waived her argument that the officer unreasonably prolonged the stop. At the time the officer made the stop, he knew the following: (1) the time was approximately 2:30 a.m.; (2) defendant's vehicle was stopped at an intersection for &quot;some time&quot;; (3) the driver of the vehicle failed to signal a turn at the intersection; and, (4) after the vehicle turned, it drifted toward the fog line. The appellate court did not need not determine whether the officer could have formed a reasonable suspicion that defendant committed a statutory signal or lane violation as, based on all the circumstances, the officer could have formed a reasonable suspicion to stop defendant for driving while intoxicated. Accordingly, the initial stop of defendant's vehicle was valid. Also, a reasonable officer could not help but have wondered about the passenger's behavior which constituted articulable and suspicious facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of orders of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which held that under 2003 Wis. Laws 187, &sect; 8, modifications applied to trials to determine whether appellants should be committed, even though the Wis. Stat. ch. 980 petitions filed against them antedated the effective date of 2003 Wis. Laws 187.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">2003 Wis. Laws 187 modified both the definition of a &quot;sexually violent person&quot; and the threshold required to establish that a person whom the State sought to commit under Wis. Stat. ch. 980 was &quot;dangerous to others.&quot; 2003 Wis. Act 187, &sect; 8, made these modifications effective to hearings, trials, and proceedings that were commenced on or after April 22, 2004. The Wis. Stat. ch. 980 petitions seeking to commit appellants were filed in 2001 and 2003 respectively, but neither appellant had yet had their trials under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.05. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court that the modifications were applicable to both appellants. The court stated that the petitions filed against appellants did not vest in them any immutable right to be tried under the then-existing standard for dangerousness; rather the legislature could modify the threshold for dangerousness so long as the applicable criteria remain relevant to chapter 980's underlying purposes of both protecting society and providing needed treatment to persons whose mental disorder makes them dangerous. In addition, there was no unconstitutional retroactive application of the modifications.</SPAN></P>

The petitioner asserted that civil commitment in Wisconsin long had required a finding of dangerousness and from the beginning, that dangerousness had required some type of temporal context.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client argued that the circuit court lacked competency to decide the issue, claiming that the circuit court could enter such a judgment for fees only if authorized by Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.23(3)(a) (2003-2004), but that the statute did not apply to the facts of the case. The client asserted that the only plausible way the statute applied to the case was if a &quot;substitution of attorneys&quot; occurred. The client argued that a substitution did not occur because the law firm withdrew from representation and was not replaced by another attorney. The appellate court ruled that the client's interpretation of the statute was unreasonable. The statute contemplated that when an attorney withdrew, the circuit court had the authority to address attorney fees. The appellate court observed no reason why the reason for the withdrawal, the client's consent or lack of consent, or the fact that no subsequent attorney assumed representation, should lead to a different result. Also, the law firm's request for attorney fees on appeal was denied because the appellate court did not believe that every issue was frivolous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for illegally shining deer, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 29.314(3)(a) (2003-04), in the Circuit Court for Pepin County, Wisconsin. He appealed, asserting that the statute violated his right to bear arms under the Wisconsin Constitution. He further argued that the circuit court erred by refusing to allow him to argue to the jury that an unloaded, cased rifle was not a firearm for purposes of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the facts established that a warden cited defendant for shining deer while in possession of a firearm. The warden seized two spotlights from the vehicle as well as two hunting rifles that were unloaded and cased. The appellate court held that the State's exercise of its police powers in enacting the shining statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 29.314(3)(a) (2003-04), outweighed an individual's right to be in possession of a firearm while shining deer. Therefore, the statute did not interfere with defendant's constitutional right to keep and bear arms under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 25. The appellate court also rejected defendant's argument that a firearm was not a firearm for purposes of the shining statute absent the presence of ammunition. A &quot;firearm&quot; was not defined in Wis. Stat. &sect; 29.314 (2003-04), but case law showed that a firearm did not have to be loaded in order to be considered a firearm. Finally, ammunition could be easily hidden or disposed of by throwing it out a window. In the context of illegally shining deer while in possession of a weapon, the State's ability to regulate the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and to protect wildlife outweighed any inconvenience.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order entered after the trial court denied her motion filed pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 118.15(5)(b)(2) (2001-02). In that motion, she sought dismissal of the complaint against her, which alleged one count of failing to cause a child to attend school, contrary the compulsory school attendance law, Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 118.15(1), (5) and 118.16(5) (2001-02). The basis for the motion was that she was unable to comply with the compulsory attendance law because of the disobedience of her child. The trial court held that the motion was premature because application of the disobedience defense did not apply unless there had already been a conviction under Wis. Stat. &sect; 118.15(5)(a). Because the trial court erroneously interpreted the statute to require a conviction before the disobedience defense applied, the court reversed the order and remand for further proceedings. The disobedience exception to &sect; 118.15(5)(b)(2) was an affirmative defense to the charge and thus should have been presented to the fact-finder during the trial for resolution.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that the trial court considered the appropriate sentencing factors, as it considered the seriousness of the crime, describing the devastating impact drugs had on families and children, and considered defendant's character. Also, the condition restricting defendant's association with the drug community was both reasonably related to his crime and to his rehabilitation, as well as the need to protect the community. The condition that defendant not have contact with the drug community would help him remain drug-free, and ensure that he did not sell drugs in the community again.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Approximately two months before he turned 18, defendant was charged with first-degree reckless homicide using a dangerous weapon, attempted first-degree intentional homicide using a dangerous weapon, and mutilating a corpse. He was charged as an adult. He entered a guilty plea to all of the charges. His convictions were upheld on appeal. In 1997, he filed a pro se motion pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06 (1997-98). The trial court denied the motion. Defendant's appeal of the denial was dismissed. In 2004, he filed a second pro se motion pursuant to &sect; 974.06 (2003-04). The trial court denied the motion without a hearing. On appeal, the court found that all of defendant's claims were raised, or could have been raised, in his direct appeal or in his 1997 &sect; 974.06 motion. Defendant's arguments were procedurally barred. The fact that his appeal of the order denying his 1997 &sect; 974.06 motion was dismissed pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.83(2) (1997-98) did not change the result. The claimed failure of his trial counsel to advise him of the rights he waived by pleading guilty was precisely the type of issue that was known to him at the time of his first Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed motions to suppress all evidence that a police officer acquired after opening the door to defendant's truck after a routine traffic stop and to suppress evidence of a preliminary breath test (PBT). The Circuit Court for Crawford County (Wisconsin) rejected both motions, and defendant pled guilty to operating while intoxicated (OWI), second offense, in violation of Wis. Stat. 346.63 (2003-04). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the arresting officer lacked reasonable suspicion to continue to detain him for an OWI investigation after the initial reason for the traffic stop was resolved. Defendant also argued that the officer conducted an illegal search by opening his truck's door during the stop, obtaining evidence that the trial court should have suppressed. The appellate court held that the facts known to the officer justified the continued detention and investigation. The court agreed that the officer's opening of the truck door was an illegal search. However, the evidence uncovered by the search was admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine. The odor of intoxication that the search revealed would inevitably have been discovered; it was therefore admissible. While the exclusionary rule generally barred the evidentiary use of such improperly gathered evidence, the officer opened the truck's door while simultaneously ordering defendant to exit the vehicle. Had he not opened the door, defendant would still have been required to exit the vehicle. At that point the officer, standing near the door and preparing to conduct field sobriety tests, would have detected the odor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this class action, plaintiff beneficiary sued defendant Department of Employee Trust Funds claiming that the failure to pay her accrued earnings or interest on her death benefit after the date of her husband's death constituted a taking in violation of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;13. The Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, granted the beneficiary's motion for summary judgment. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In granting summary judgment for the beneficiary, the circuit court held that the Department's failure, for lump sum death benefits paid to beneficiaries under Wis. Stat. &sect; 40.73(1)(c) (2003-04), to include interest or earnings accrued from the date of the participants' deaths until payments were made to the beneficiaries constituted an unlawful taking under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court of appeals disagreed, concluding that the beneficiary did not acquire a property interest in her lump sum death benefit until she satisfied the requirements of Wis. Stat. &sect; 40.71(3). Thus, the Department's failure to pay her interest or earnings on the amount of her death benefit calculated under Wis. Stat. &sect; 40.73(1)(c) between the date of her husband's death and the Department's receipt and processing of her death benefit application did not violate Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court of appeals' conclusion did not dispose of the claims of beneficiaries who received account-value benefits under Wis. Stat. &sect; 40.73(1)(am) because the period for which those beneficiaries claimed to have been wrongfully denied interest occurred after they had applied for and received an initial death benefit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appealed order was reversed, and the circuit court was directed on remand to dismiss the beneficiary's complaint.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 943.32(1)(b) and (2), 939.05, 939.32, 939.62(1)(c) and (2), 948.40(1),(3) and 4(b), and 939.62(1)(c) and (2) (2003-2004).</SPAN></P>

The witness was released on his own recognizances, and the trial court was later informed that the witness was not available because he had run away from home. Defendant asserted that the subpoena for the adjourned trial was only mailed to the witness, and as a result, there was no showing by the State that the witness would not appear at trial if personally served with a subpoena. The appellate court rejected defendant's contention that personal service of a subpoena for the new trial date was required in order to conclude that the witness's deposition was admissible under Wis. Stat. &sect; 967.04 (2003-2004). Wis. Stat. &sect; 967.04 did not require personal service of a subpoena, and once the witness was personally served with a subpoena for the first trial date, the service of a new subpoena was not required to maintain the witness's obligation to attend the adjourned trial date.</SPAN></P>

The first defendant stepped in front of the warden and demanded to see a search warrant. The warden radioed for assistance. The warden then alleged that the first defendant threatened to push him. The warden then grabbed the first defendant to push him away. An altercation between the two men ensued. The first defendant alleged self-defense under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.48(1) (2001-2002). The warden's supervisor arrived and began to photograph what was happening. The second defendant also demanded a search warrant and, when that was not produced, he slapped at the supervisor and his camera. On appeal, the court found that there was insufficient evidence to support the obstructing a warden conviction as to the second defendant, and that the jury was improperly charged as to the disorderly conduct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Eau Claire County (Wisconsin), which granted a motion for a temporary restraining order filed by plaintiff pawnbrokers and declared that a city ordinance was unconstitutional. The ordinance at issue required the pawnbrokers to join the Automated Pawn System (APS), a computerized system that allowed users to track information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted an ordinance requiring pawnbrokers to join the APS, a computerized system that allowed users to track information about both customers and merchandise. The ordinance imposed a $ 1 fee per transaction. The pawnbrokers filed a complaint and a motion for a temporary restraining order to prohibit the city from implementing the ordinance. The trial court granted the restraining order and declared the ordinance unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that the ordinance was not unconstitutional even though it treated pawnbrokers differently from secondhand dealers. The city had a rational and reasonable basis for applying the APS requirement exclusively to pawnbrokers. During hearings prior to enacting the ordinance, the city council heard evidence that there were more pawn transactions than secondhand transactions, and much more stolen property was recovered from the city's pawnshops than from its secondhand dealers. Based on the data, the city reasonably and rationally concluded it should require heightened monitoring from pawnshops. The court further found that the $ 1 transaction fee did not amount to an unconstitutional tax enacted without taxing authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court for Portage County (Wisconsin), which convicted defendant of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated as a third offense pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1) (2001, 2002). Defendant asserted that it was error to deny defendant's motion to suppress because the police officer who stopped defendant did not have the reasonable suspicion required to justify the initial stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with drunk driving offenses under Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1) (2001-02) after his vehicle was stopped for having excessively loud exhaust noise. The circuit court denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence of defendant's intoxication that the police obtained during the course of the stop. Defendant had alleged that the police did not have probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe defendant was committing any offense at the time of the stop. Affirming the denial of the motion to suppress, the court held that the police officer had established that there was a reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's car for a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 347.39(1) when the police officer observed that the car was excessively noisy and had an excessively loud exhaust. From the officer's testimony, the circuit court reasonably inferred that the officer had experience listening to thousands of car mufflers and that he knew the difference between a loud muffler and an excessively loud muffler. Because there was reasonable suspicion to make the initial stop, the court agreed with the circuit court that the motion to suppress should have been denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted in 1985 of two counts of first-degree murder while armed with a dangerous weapon, two counts of carrying a concealed weapon, and possession of a controlled substance. In his postconviction motion, the inmate requested that the circuit court order a new trial or modify his sentence. The appellate court ruled that the circuit court correctly held that the inmate had not established a new factor. The inmate contended that his trial counsel possessed psychological evidence of his incompetence but chose not to present it. Thus, the inmate could not satisfy one of the fundamental components of the &quot;new factor&quot; definition, that the fact was unknowingly overlooked by all of the parties. Also, the inmate did not explain how the non-disclosure of the psychological evidence frustrated the purpose of the original sentence. Furthermore, the appellate court failed to see how Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.195 (2001-2002) constituted a change in parole policy for the inmate. Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.195 had no impact on the inmate, thus his sentence could not have been increased by its enactment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer went to defendant's apartment to investigate a report of a reckless driver. The officer explained why he was there, and asked defendant if she wanted to step inside or outside to talk, preferring that she not stand in the doorway. Defendant stepped outside and sat on the step outside the porch door. The officer noticed that her balance was unsteady, her speech was slurred, she would hesitate before responding to questions, and there was a strong odor of intoxicants. Defendant pled no contest to the OWI charge after the circuit court denied her motion to suppress evidence. Defendant argued that the arresting officer violated her Fourth Amendment protections when he induced her to step outside of her apartment to talk and then physically restrained her from re-entering. Defendant conceded that the officer did not cross the threshold of her doorway, but cast the officer's statement as a threat to enter. The appellate court ruled that the circuit court's findings were supported by the evidence. No unconstitutional seizure occurred. The officer did not enter defendant's apartment, nor did he threaten to do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had argued that a &quot;DUI&quot; in Illinois could not be counted as a prior offense in Wisconsin because it was resolved with a supervision agreement without the entry of a judgment of conviction.

On appeal, defendant contended that if his argument before the trial court lacked merit on appeal, then &sect; 343.307(1)(d) was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court noted that defendant's argument before the trial court had previously been resolved against him by judicial precedent and would not be overruled. The appellate court held that &sect; 343.307(1)(d) survived defendant's challenge because any person with common sense would know it permitted counting violations, not just convictions, of other states' statutes that prohibited the use of a motor vehicle while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

The inmate appealed after the circuit court dismissed all of his claims except as for one claim against the warden, which was transferred to a different court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that his mail was unlawfully interfered with, that he was retaliated against, that an administrative complaint was intentionally impeded, that Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, truck owner, appealed two orders of the Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin. The first order affirmed a decision of the Municipal Court for the City of Madison, Wisconsin, regarding a city ordinance prohibiting off-street parking of certain vehicles and a second order denying his motion to reconsider the first order, in the underlying action with respondent, City of Madison, Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's truck had a cargo box, and it was stipulated that the truck weighed 7200 pounds empty. A city zoning inspector testified that the owner parked the truck at the owner's residence on eight dates. The municipal court found the owner guilty of violating Madison, Wis., Gen. Ordinances &sect; 28.11(3)(a)1. The ordinance provided off-street parking facilities solely for the parking of passenger automobiles, including passenger trucks, limited in size to less than one ton in capacity. The appellate court determined that the question was not whether the circuit court erred, but whether the municipal court erred, and the owner made no complaints of any municipal court error. Though the owner asserted in passing that his truck had less than one ton capacity and less cargo volume per passenger than other personal use vehicles and had four wheels, rather than six, that was the extent of his argument. The owner cited no statutes, administrative rules, ordinances, court cases, or other authority showing that vehicles with these characteristics were less than &quot;one ton in capacity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders were affirmed in part and reversed in part and remanded to the circuit court with instructions to file an amended judgment of conviction, if it concluded that its standard of review permitted it to do so, and, if the circuit court did not so conclude, it should remand to the municipal court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners appealed from a judgment on a jury verdict awarding them $ 10,700 for property taken by the County for highway construction. They contended that, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 32.09(6) (2001-02), they were entitled to an additional $ 43,894 in severance damages. Because the court concluded that the plain language of &sect; 32.09(6) did not provide severance damages when compensation for a partial taking was based on the fair market value of the property taken, as it was in the current action, it affirmed. No language or punctuation marker set the severance damage portion of the section apart from the either/or construction set forth at the beginning of the sentence in &sect; 32.09(6). Therefore, the court read the severance damages language to be a part of the either/or logic of the statute and concluded that such damages were available only under a &quot;before and after&quot; method of compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which required him to register as a sex offender pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 938.34(15m)(bm) and 301.45(1m) (2001-02) after he admitted to committing sexual assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile, at age 13, engaged in fellatio with a five-year-old child on two occasions. Pursuant to a negotiated plea, the juvenile admitted that he committed one act of third-degree sexual assault. However, he reserved the right to challenge the statutory requirement that he register as a sex offender. The trial court required the juvenile to register as a sex offender. On appeal, the juvenile challenged the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 938.34(15m)(bm) and 301.45(1m). The court found that under Wisconsin law, requiring anyone to register as a sex offender was not a criminal punishment. Hence, there was no right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court could not conclude that the juvenile proved that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 938.34(15m)(bm) and 301.45(1m) (2001-02) were unconstitutional. Because the court declined to recognize that children were members of a suspect class with a fundamental liberty right to have their best interest considered before the state made decisions about them, the court declined to apply the strict scrutiny test to the juvenile's equal protection analysis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the dispositional order requiring the juvenile to register as a sex offender and remanded so that the trial court could decide whether to stay the sex offender registration portion of the dispositional order as of the date of that order. The court affirmed the order of the trial court in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After he was disciplined in an out-of-state prison, plaintiff inmate brought an action for certiorari review of the disciplinary decision. The Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, granted respondent prison warden's motion to quash and dismiss the action, concluding that it lacked competency to review the disciplinary decision and lacked personal jurisdiction over the warden. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the inmate contended that the Wisconsin courts retained the ability to conduct certiorari review of a Wisconsin inmate's due process or equal protection challenge to a disciplinary action, even if the challenge involved conduct and a disciplinary proceeding that took place while the inmate was housed out of state. The appellate court concluded that the inmate failed to make a prima facie showing that he was entitled to certiorari review in Wisconsin. The inmate did not seek judicial review in the courts where he was in prison; instead, while still in the other state, he filed his certiorari action in Wisconsin. Because the inmate never sought judicial review in the other state, he never obtained a court decision asserting a lack of jurisdiction or competency to review the matter in that state. Since the inmate did not show that judicial review in the other state was unavailable because a court there concluded that it lacked jurisdiction or competency, the inmate failed to show that judicial review was unavailable under Wis. Stat.  &sect; 302.02(3t). Consequently, the inmate failed to show that Wisconsin courts had competency to entertain his certiorari action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his former wife had one child, and defendant had two more children by two other women.

The appellate court ruled that the sexual relations condition amounted to protection of the public, and requiring defendant to accept responsibility for any children he might produce forced him to acknowledge that his actions had consequences. Also, the condition of absolute sobriety was reasonably related to defendant's rehabilitation. Furthermore, interest could not be added to a restitution order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, convicted defendant of lewd and lascivious behavior in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.20(1)(b) (2001-02). Defendant's postconviction motions for a directed verdict and a judgment notwithstanding the verdict were denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that the State failed to produce sufficient evidence supporting a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on elements one and two of Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.20(1)(b) (2001-02): that he exposed his genitals and that he did so publicly. The appellate court disagreed, finding that although defendant was in his parked vehicle when he was caught, he was parked on the side of a main, frequently traveled public road, near a public park and playground, on a sunny day, and the officer had a clear view of defendant's penis as he approached the car. Thus, the evidence supported the inference that defendant knew or had reason to know that by parking there and exposing his genitals there, his genitals would be &quot;open to view&quot; to other persons. Further, defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy where he was parked. Whether defendant intended for others to view him was irrelevant, as &sect; 944.20(1)(b) did not require a finding of intent. The appellate court declined to consider defendant's argument that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because the issue was inadequately briefed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county filed a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court for Brown County, Wisconsin, arguing that either judicial assistants could not constitutionally be included in a collective bargaining unit or that they were confidential employees under the Municipal Employee Relations Act, Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.70(1)(i) (2001-02). The trial court dismissed the action. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county argued that the trial court improperly exercised its discretion because it concluded in a cursory fashion the issues to be resolved were factual rather than analyzing statutory and case law to resolve its motion, and that the trial court should have found that including judicial assistants in a collective bargaining unit violated the separation of powers by infringing on the inherent constitutional authority of the judicial branch. The appellate court noted that jurisdiction of agencies had to be given priority in the absence of a valid reason for judicial intervention. The appellate court held that the distinction between confidential and municipal employees often depended not on posted job descriptions but on a factual record that had to first be developed before the agency. The appellate court concluded that the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission could find that judicial assistants were confidential employees thereby avoiding the constitutional question entirely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee was sexually assaulted by a coemployee. She sued defendant employer for negligence, asserting the employer knew or should have known the coemployee had previous incidents of sexual assaults and employed him without advising her or other employees of his past history. The Circuit Court for Waukesha County, Wisconsin, granted summary judgment for the employer based on Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.03(2) (2001-02). The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee contended that the Wisconsin Worker's Compensation Act's (WCA) exclusive remedy provision, Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.03(2) (2001-02), should not have precluded a claim by an employee against an employer for negligent hiring, training and supervision when the injury was a sexual assault committed by a coemployee. She presented several public policy reasons in favor of the creation of an exception. However, the appellate court held that her claims for injuries caused by the sexual assault upon her by the coemployee were precluded by the exclusivity provision in &sect; 102.03(2). The WCAs purpose, history and application demonstrated that the appellate court was not the proper authority to create a public policy exception to the WCAs exclusivity provision. The appellate court also held that &sect; 102.03(2) did not violate the employee's rights to equal protection and due process. The appellate court noted that the multiple and protracted lawsuits in circuit courts which would have ensued if employers were exposed to tort claims for the intentional conduct of other employees would have emasculated the WCA, and would have adversely affected employers, employees and the public.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, Department of Corrections parole agents (parole agents), sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which denied their motion to dismiss plaintiff inmate's action that the parole agents violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII by deliberately refusing to release him on parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parole agents appealed an order denying their motion to dismiss the inmate's action filed under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The parole agents contended that they were entitled to qualified immunity from the inmate's claim that they violated the U.S. Const. amend. VIII's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by deliberately refusing to release him on parole for 377 days beyond his mandatory release (MR) date. The court affirmed, stating that a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 defendant was not entitled to qualified immunity, when, even if there was some uncertainty in the law regarding precisely which constitutional provision was violated, the law nonetheless clearly established that the alleged conduct violated the United States Constitution. Further, at the time the inmate reached his MR date, the law clearly established, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 302.11 (2001-02), that deliberately holding a person in prison beyond a statutorily prescribed release date violated a right guaranteed by the constitution. Accordingly, the court affirmed the order permitting the inmate's claim to proceed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed pro se from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Manitowoc County (Wisconsin) convicting her for operating while intoxicated, second offense, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a) (2001-02).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From the very outset of her encounter with an officer, defendant asked for an attorney. Because this request was not immediately accommodated, defendant argued that she was denied her right to counsel and that the forced blood test result should have been suppressed. Defendant's argument was previously rejected by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. In Wisconsin, there was no right under the implied consent statute to consult with an attorney before deciding whether to submit to a chemical test. Because defendant already consented to the test, it was unnecessary to secure the advice of an attorney about the decision to submit. Contrary to defendant's assertions, Wis. Stat. &sect; 885.235 (2001-02) did not distinguish between a chemical test that resulted from a blood draw under the implied consent law or one obtained involuntarily following a refusal. The instant court upheld the circuit court's admission of the blood draw result, which reflected a blood ethanol concentration of 0.202 g/100 ml. In addition to the blood test result, the jury heard testimony from the officer. Based on his observations and experience, the officer believed defendant to be under the influence of intoxicants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and operating with a prohibited alcohol concentration, moved to suppress a chemical breath test and post-arrest statements to police. The Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, granted defendant's motion, and the City appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion was decided, by stipulation, based on an officer's police report, which stated he saw defendant's vehicle drive &quot;closely behind&quot; others vehicles, veer within its lane, and make a right-hand turn without coming to a full stop or signaling. The officer stopped defendant's vehicle and noted a strong odor of intoxicants inside the vehicle. The circuit court held that too much information was missing from the report to support a reasonable suspicion that defendant's driving behaviors were unusual or erratic. The appellate court agreed, noting that an investigative stop was presumptively unconstitutional. The police report lacked such key facts as defendant's speed, the speed limit, and road and traffic conditions. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 364.14(1) (2003), following a vehicle &quot;extremely closely&quot; was unusual only if the driver followed more closely than was reasonable and prudent, having due regard for speed, traffic, and highway conditions. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.34 (2003), failure to give a right-hand turn signal was not a traffic violation unless other traffic was affected. Inconsequential movement within a lane did not give an officer the authority to make an investigative stop.</SPAN></P>

The officers were successful in waking her and she admitted that she had been driving and that she had obviously hit something with her vehicle. The trial court suppressed the evidence as a result of a U.S. Const. amend. IV violation, but the court reversed. The officers were acting within their authority to investigate the hit-and-run accident and they also had consent from the son to enter defendant's home. Their entry into the home was neither unlawful nor unconstitutional. Further, defendant was not in custody while inside her home, or outside her home when inspecting her vehicle. She was not placed in custody until the officers had probable cause to arrest her. Therefore, the evidence obtained in the investigation should not have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

He had sent letters, left notes, and made many phone calls, all of which included thinly veiled threats against the victim. Indeed, defendant had a restraining order in place against him relating to the victim. Defendant also endangered the lives of other innocent motorists when he followed the victim. Further, because defendant's conduct constituted &quot;otherwise disorderly&quot; conduct that created a &quot;real possibility&quot; of disrupting peace and good order, Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.01 was appropriately applied to his conduct in the case.

Stat. &sect; 974.06 motion. It did. Defendant did not offer a sufficient reason for his failure to raise all of his claims in his first &sect; 974.06 motion and he did not do so on appeal. Accordingly, any claims raised for the first time in his second &sect; 974.06 motion were procedurally barred, and the trial court properly denied his &quot;supplemental&quot; &sect; 974.06 motion. Defendant could not seek sentence modification under &sect; 974.06.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner purchased the lot from the seller. As part of the sale, the seller agreed to restrict an adjoining lot to prohibit the operation of any restaurants specializing in Mexican food. Modifications to the restrictive covenant were made by the seller and a third party. Subsequently, the lot was sold to the restaurant. After a dispute arose between the parties, the owner filed a complaint seeking to enjoin the restaurant from operating on the lot. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the restaurant after finding that the restrictive covenant was ambiguous. In reversing, the court determined that the modification of the restrictive covenant did not dilute the owner's rights under the original agreement. As such, the purported modification was a nullity. In addition, the terms &quot;specializing in&quot; and &quot;primarily&quot; were not ambiguous. The fact that the standard was difficult to apply did not make the terms ambiguous or vague. However, the court determined that summary judgment was inappropriate because there were genuine issues of fact that required a trial. The court noted that the seller may have been a necessary party to any further proceedings in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was reversed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A gun was found in defendant's home after a police officer asked defendant's three-year-old son if there were any guns in the house and the child showed the officer where the shotgun was hidden. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence. Defendant appealed after pleading guilty to one count of felon in possession of a firearm, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.29(2) (2001-02).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the police questioning of his son while he was not present constituted an invalid search leading to the discovery of the gun. He argued that the search was unconstitutional and the trial court should have granted his suppression motion. The appellate court was not persuaded. Defendant consented to police entry and search of his residence in response to the gun complaint. The dispute was whether the questioning of defendant's son, after defendant left his son alone with the officer in the living room, violated the scope of the consent and amounted to deceit or trickery. The appellate court held that such conduct suggested that defendant did not assert any reasonable expectation of privacy prohibiting the officer from speaking with his son. Moreover, the officer's question to the child probably did not even constitute a search. Rather, it was on-the-scene questioning of a potential witness in an ongoing investigation. What happened after the officer's question was solely at the child's own volition. The child proceeded to pull open a heating vent, plainly exposing a shotgun. At the point the child moved the vent, the gun was in plain view and had to be seized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Grant County Department of Social Services, petitioned for guardianship and protective placement of an Illinois resident. Respondent board, the agency responsible for performing evaluations on individuals who were the subject of guardianships, moved to dismiss based on the residency requirement of Wis. Stat. &sect; 55.06(3)(c) (2001-02). The Circuit Court for Grant County, Wisconsin, granted the dismissal. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject of the petition for guardianship was a 46-year-old woman who suffered from Wernicke's encephalopathy, was on Medicaid, and had family in Grant County. The appeals court reversed the dismissal of the petition, finding that the statutory residency requirements violated her right to interstate travel. The court reasoned that the subject could not live in the nursing home near her family without a protective placement order and, under Wisconsin statutes, she could not access the court to receive such an order without first living in a Wisconsin County. Because she was incompetent, she could not first move to Wisconsin outside a nursing home and have a petition for protective placement filed on her behalf. Therefore, &sect; 55.06(3)(c)&nbsp;unconstitutionally burdened her right to travel. Section 55.06(3)(c) did not establish a bona fide residency requirement, but restricted the subject's ability to access the courts for consideration of her only means to move to Wisconsin. The board's claim of fiscal burden was speculative. The power of the State to confine its public services to residents did not entitle it to establish arbitrary barriers to a nonresident's becoming a resident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court dismissing the petition and remanded for proceedings consistent with the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff conservancy corporation filed an action seeking a declaration that the conveyance of state property to defendant village was void because the conveyance violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 84.09(5) (2001-02) and a manual of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (DOT). The Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) granted summary judgment in favor of the conservancy. The village, along with defendant association, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conservancy entered into a contract with a village that made a competing offer for the property. The competing offer was rejected, and the conservancy brought a complaint challenging DOT's conveyance of the property. The complaint alleged that the letter report submitted to the governor was not a full and complete report as required by &sect; 84.09(5). Defendants brought a motion to dismiss based on their position that the conservancy did not have standing to bring the action. The circuit court denied the motion. The circuit court then granted summary judgment in favor of the conservancy, determining that title to the property remained in the state. On appeal, the court reversed, stating that the conservancy did not have a legally protectible interest in the requirement in &sect; 84.09(5) that DOT provide a complete report to the governor or in the requirement of the governor's approval. The &quot;full and complete report&quot; was plainly for the governor's benefit, not the benefit of potential purchasers. Additionally, a manual prepared by DOT for use in sales under that statute could not alter that result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With respect to the decision to keep the inmate in administrative confinement, he exhausted his administrative remedies and then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the circuit court. The circuit court dismissed the petition based on its finding that the petition, filed on October 24, 2001, was filed more than 45-days after August 13, 2001, the date of the decision of the Wisconsin Secretary of the Department of Corrections. The appellate court ruled that it need not address the timeliness of the petition because it found that the circuit court's decision should be affirmed on other grounds, namely, that arguments made in the inmate's petition lacked merit. The inmate argued that a defect in one proceeding invalidated all subsequent proceedings, however, the inmate's challenge was directed at an administrative confinement hearing that did not involve reliance on defective findings from any previous hearing. Also, the inmate's argument that Wis. Admin. Code &sect; DOC 308.04(10) was unconstitutionally vague because it left a person to guess regarding the effect of the ACRC's failure to follow its own rules, lacked merit on its face.</SPAN></P>

Probable cause to believe a person was no longer a sexually violent person was not satisfied by a recommendation of supervised release without more. Petitioner next argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.09 (2001-02) violated his due process rights. Nevertheless, under the statute, a committed individual who was unable to proceed under &sect; 980.09 was not without the opportunity to pursue a less restrictive alternative to commitment. Petitioner next contended that his due process rights were violated because the circuit court failed to initiate proceedings following remand. Petitioner's letter asking the circuit court to take action in his case was filed 10 months after remittitur, well within the one-year time limit established by the statute. The circuit court responded promptly, requesting clarification. As soon as petitioner clarified matters, the trial court took swift and appropriate action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury of the Circuit Court for Green Lake County, Wisconsin, convicted defendant of a first offense of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI) and first offense operating a motor vehicle with a prohibited alcohol concentration, Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a), (b). The circuit court had denied her motion to suppress the results of a blood test administered following her arrest. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the arresting officer's request for a blood test, to which she consented, was unreasonable because less intrusive tests were available and should have been used because her case was deemed to be civil as a first offense. The court disagreed. In case law discussing the permissibility of blood tests, the Wisconsin Supreme Court had expressly addressed arrests for a drunk-driving related violation or crime. The phrase &quot;violation or crime&quot; revealed the contemplated application of these requirements to noncriminal offenses. Thus, a blood draw taken to obtain evidence of intoxication from a person lawfully arrested for a civil drunk-driving related violation was permissible if all remaining requirements were also satisfied. Defendant did not contest the three remaining requirements. Thus, the test did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father claimed that actual notice regarding the termination of his parental rights was required. The court order removing the child from the mother's care specifically warned of the possible termination of parental rights, as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.356(2). Thus, the trial court's directed verdict was proper. Next, the father argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(1)(a)2, as applied to him, was unconstitutional, as there was no evidence that he actually received notice, thus, his due process rights were violated. The notice procedures in the statute satisfied basic due process rights. Thus, the father did not satisfy his burden of showing that the statute was unconstitutional. Finally, the father argued that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury that a parent's lack of opportunity and/or ability to establish a substantial parental relationship was not a defense to failure to assume parental responsibility. But, the State still held the same burden of proving failure to assume parental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence, and the father was still permitted present evidence that he established a parental relationship with the child.</SPAN></P>

However, the error was harmless because a change in placement was not in the child's best interests. The child was well adjusted, was doing well in school and was participating in both sports and an accelerated learning program. The father failed to rebut the presumption that the allocation of decision making under the legal custody order and the continuation of the child's primary physical placement with the mother were in the best interest of the child.</SPAN></P>

First, the intent behind Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 25 was to preserve the Wisconsin Legislature's authority to restrict the possession of firearms by felons. Second, the right to bear arms was a qualified right, subject to reasonable restrictions under the State's police power. The restriction placed upon felons prohibiting them from possessing firearms was a reasonable exercise of the State's inherent police power. A rational relationship existed between statutes forbidding possession of firearms by any and all convicted felons and the legitimate state purpose of protecting the public from the misuse of firearms. Third, inconsistency in criminal verdicts was not per se grounds for reversal, and there was no inconsistency in the verdict in light of the evidence presented.</SPAN></P>

Defendant first protested that the real controversy was not fully tried, as the jury was not charged with determining whether he was guilty of domestic abuse. However, the trial court imposed the domestic abuse surcharge under Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.055 (2001-02). Thus, if the statutory conditions were fulfilled, the court was obligated to make the assessment. Here, defendant was convicted under Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.01 (2001-02), fulfilling the first prong, and the conduct constituting the violation involved his wife, fulfilling the second prong. Moreover, the statute explicitly granted the sentencing authority to the court; there was nothing for a jury to deliberate. The assessment was properly imposed. The court properly ordered his wife's testimony. Defendant claimed that the jury should have been given a self-defense instruction, but he never objected to the instructions. To the extent that defendant claimed he made a prima facie case of discriminatory prosecution, it was not enough for him to claim a reasonable person, free of sexual prejudice, would have concluded that his wife was the aggressor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which entered a conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant (OWI). The charge resulting in the conviction was refiled after the trial court dismissed the charge without prejudice following its decision to exclude certain State's evidence as a sanction for a violation of the discovery statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.23 (2001-02).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court in the second action erred in denying his motion to exclude evidence because of the decision in the first action to exclude it. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that exclusion in the second action was not required by &sect; 971.23, by the equal protection clause, or by any of the preclusion and estoppel doctrines on which defendant relied. The court stated that there was nothing in &sect; 971.23(7m) to suggest that the State could not obtain a dismissal of charges after evidence was excluded and then refile the charges. Additionally, the court stated that &sect; 971.23(7m) did not violate the equal protection clause. The State had a legitimate interest in the prosecution of criminal charges, consistent with the constitutional rights afforded defendant. Allowing the State the opportunity to dismiss and refile charges when evidence had been excluded under &sect; 971.23(7m) but might not be excluded in a new action furthered that interest in a rational way. Claim preclusion was inapplicable, because there was no final judgment on the merits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which entered a conviction of one count of possession of child pornography in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.12 (1999-2000). Defendant also appealed from an order denying his motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police executed a search warrant at defendant's residence and seized his computer. A floppy disk found in the computer contained an image of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Defendant was subsequently convicted of possession of child pornography. On appeal, defendant contended that &sect; 948.12 was both overbroad and vague. The court disagreed, stating that child pornography was not protected under the First Amendment and &sect; 948.12 constitutionally prohibited its possession. Defendant also contended that the State should have been required to prove that the child was indeed under the age of 18 and that the child was an actual person. The court stated that, in this case, additional evidence regarding the age of the child was not necessary and that the determination of whether the image was an actual child was properly within the province of the jury. The court also held that computer disks that stored images of child pornography were included within the meaning of the phrase &quot;or other pictorial reproduction&quot; in &sect; 948.12. Finally, the court rejected defendant's argument that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to bring a motion challenging the search warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was a police detective and youth minister, pled guilty to enticing a child for purposes of exposing a sex organ, Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.07 (1999-2000), based on allegations of an extended sexual relationship with a 16-year-old girl. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, imposed seven years in prison and five years of extended supervision. Defendant appealed the conviction and the denial of postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When imposing sentence, the trial court mistakenly referred to enticing the victim for purposes of sexual contact rather than for exposure. The reviewing court held that the error was harmless. The postconviction court had explained that the specific motive did not affect the basis for the sentence because the act of enticement was done for the purpose of a sexually inappropriate act. That explanation reflected an accurate understanding of the law. The postconviction court also properly rejected any argument that the victim's conduct reduced the gravity of the offense. Defendant did not establish the lower court's reliance on allegedly inaccurate information that he impregnated the victim or that she attempted suicide. The sentencing remarks established a clear focus on defendant's violation of his positions of trust. Thus, the disclaimer of reliance on pregnancy and attempted suicide was not implausible, as defendant argued. Finally, considering defendant's misuse of his position as a youth minister, his job as a police officer, his age, and his education, and considering the emotional trauma suffered by the victim and her family, the sentence is not unduly harsh or excessive.</SPAN></P>

Second, the river alliance argued that the trial court erred by failing to review the validity of Wisconsin's anti-degradation implementation procedures. Third, the river alliance claimed the trial court erred by not reviewing the classification of North Fork of the Jump River (North Fork). The instant court agreed that the river alliance stated a claim challenging Wis. Admin. Code &sect; NR 102.13 pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.40 (2001-02). The cause was remanded for the trial court to consider the river alliance's allegations that Wis. Admin. Code &sect; NR 102.13 contravened state and federal law. The remand did not include, however, review of the DNR's procedures and classification of North Fork, because the river alliance had not exhausted its administrative remedies on the issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real party in interest, an inmate, successfully pursued a common law certiorari action to overturn a disciplinary reprimand imposed after prison authorities intercepted a letter to his parents in which he described a corrections officer in derogatory terms. The Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, denied the inmate's motion for fees and costs. It also denied a motion to reconsider and reaffirmed its decision. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 814.25(2) (2001-02) violated his constitutional right to equal protection, because it prohibited him from an award of costs and fees after he prevailed in a common law certiorari action. The court disagreed. Prisoners did not constitute a suspect class for equal protection purposes, and therefore equal protection required only that the classification bear a rational relation to some legitimate end. The court found two rationales the legislature could have embraced. (1) In the case of prisoner actions challenging the conditions of confinement, the legislature could validly conclude that the successful prisoner should not be reimbursed from the public treasury, because the only person who benefited from the litigation was the prisoner. (2) The legislature could reasonably conclude that a prisoner was not entitled to the reimbursement of costs and fees, because the prisoner already received, from the public treasury, paper and pen to draft legal documents, and law libraries. In addition, a prisoner was given access to adequate assistance from &quot;writ writers&quot; and &quot;jailhouse lawyers,&quot; a form of assistance a free person was not provided by the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly supplied minors with marijuana for sexual purposes. Later, defendant entered a no-contest plea to child enticement under Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.07(6) (1997-98) and possession of marijuana. After defendant was placed on probation, he was ordered to register under Wis. Stat. &sect; 301.45 (2001-02). Thereafter, defendant sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the classification of defendant as a sex offender did not violate his due process and equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The Wisconsin Legislature could have rationally concluded that defendant's conduct posed a threat to public safety. It was disingenuous for defendant to argue that there was no rational relationship between enticing a child into a secluded place to use illegal drugs and the purpose of protecting children from sexual assaults. Moreover, the court rejected defendant's due process argument because the means chosen by the Wisconsin Legislature to effect a valid legislative objective bore a rational relationship to the purpose it sought to achieve. Therefore, the court rejected defendant's &quot;as-applied&quot; constitutional challenges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of speeding, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.57(4)(h) (2001-02), and denied his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving on a highway when he was pulled over and issued a citation for speeding. He was subsequently convicted of speeding, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.57(4)(h) (2001-02), and his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was also denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant essentially argued that the deputy's testimony that he paced defendant's car at 80 miles per hour was incredible as a matter of law, because it was inconsistent with other parts of the deputy's testimony. But the flaw in defendant's argument was that he implicitly assumed that the jury was required to accept as accurate several of the details of the deputy's testimony, such as where he was when he first observed defendant. Further, defendant argued that he was denied due process because he was denied access to the deputy's incident report and the notations on the back of the citation, but defendant failed to show that the evidence was exculpatory. There was insufficient evidence to show that the radar unit could not have yielded a result consistent with the incident report and with the deputy's testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Calument County (Wisconsin) of two counts of disorderly conduct. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. The court of appeals disagreed. The victim's daughter observed a vehicle drive by the victim's residence twice in one morning. She believed that the vehicle was driven by defendant, the person stalking her mother. Later, the daughter again contacted the sheriff's department about a suspicious vehicle. That time, an officer located and stopped the suspect vehicle, making contact with defendant. Defendant was very evasive about why he was in the area. Defendant's conduct, when looked at in the context of his pattern of behavior over 25 years, showed an obsessive interest at the least. His appearance and conduct in the parking lot at a restaurant and his repeated driving by the home two days later exemplified the extent of his obsession. Such conduct had the tendency to disrupt the peace, safety, and good order, because, as the victim's testimony demonstrated, his contact was unwelcome and abusive in nature. Further, his conduct was likely to cause or provoke a disturbance because it caused concern from other members of the victim's family and the community as a whole, including the police.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed the trial court erred in admitting the victim's statements under Wis. Stat. &sect; 908.03(2), (24) (2001-02) and in admitting his statement to the police.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sexually assaulted a four year old child. The victim's brother observed the assault and told his mother's fiance, who also lived in the home. The victim told her mother's fiance what occurred, and also described the assault to a doctor. When the police went to question defendant, the police noticed that defendant seemed to be of limited intellectual ability. Defendant admitted to having sexual intercourse with the victim within the first 30 minutes of his conversation with the police. On appeal, defendant claimed the trial court erred in admitting his statement, and erred in admitting the hearsay testimony of the victim. The appellate court affirmed the conviction. The appellate court held defendant's statement was properly admitted as defendant was not under any particular pressure during the interview, no threats were made and he spoke freely with the detectives. Defendant's limited intellectual ability did not affect the voluntariness of the statement. The child's statements were properly admitted under the excited utterance exception and the residual exception to the hearsay rule as the victim was four and the statements were made within eight hours of the assault.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 946.12(3) (2001-02). The Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) denied his motion to dismiss. Defendant appealed, arguing that &sect; 946.12(3) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, that the prosecution violated Wisconsin's speech and debate clause, Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16, and violated the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged, as majority leader, with hiring and directing senate caucus employees to conduct campaign activities using state offices, equipment, and supplies. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.12(3) was not vague or overly broad as applied. Defendant clearly had a duty to steer clear of a proscribed area of conduct, as determined by reference to a variety of sources, including the Wisconsin Senate Policy Manual, applicable statutes, and legislative rules and guidelines. The Senate Policy Manual prohibited political activity during working hours, as well as the use of State facilities, equipment, or supplies for political purposes at any time. The court found that the terms &quot;political activity&quot; and &quot;political purpose&quot; provided fair notice, because they plainly included political campaign activity. The speech and debate clause, Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16, also did not bar the prosecution, as the criminal complaint specifically identified personnel decisions that bore no resemblance to the due functioning of the legislative process. Examination by the court of the senate's unambiguous rules did not violate the separation-of-powers or political-question doctrines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the circuit court's order with regard to specific activities, as to which the court found ambiguity and therefore potential violations of the separation of powers doctrine. As modified, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father wanted equal placement, and argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.24(4)(a) (2001-2002) required it. The appellate court ruled that Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.24(4)(a) had been construed to say that while the family court had to provide placement to be regularly recurring and meaningful, this was not tantamount to a presumption of equal placement. The father also argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated due process and equal protection. The father claimed that the physical placement statutes violated due process because they deprived him of a fundamental liberty interest in equally participating in the raising of his children. The appellate court ruled that the father failed to satisfy his heavy burden to show why the State of Wisconsin should be foreclosed from allowing its courts to set placement schedules commensurate with the best interests of the children even if it meant less than equal placement; while parents did have a natural right to the care and custody of their children, this did not mean that parents had a fundamental right to equal placement periods after divorce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father sought review of a decision by the Circuit Court for Chippewa County, Wisconsin, which appointed a guardian ad litem, denied the father's motion for modification of a physical placement order, and required him to pay the full amount of the guardian ad litem's fees, rather than dividing them between the father and respondent mother. The father challenged the constitutionality of the placement and guardian ad litem statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that anything less than equal placement unfairly burdened his constitutional right to the care and custody of his children. The court disagreed, finding that, although the right to custody and care undeniably warranted deference, the State had a countervailing interest in supervising divorced families because of the unique problems that existed in a home that was split by divorce. Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.325(1)(b)1 also did not require modification of the unequal placement. Adopting the guardian ad litem's report that the children were adjusted under the current arrangement, the trial court implicitly ruled that a change would not be in their best interests. Further, the father did not overcome the presumption for maintaining the status quo, because none of the facts he relied on constituted a substantial change. Those facts included the natural aging process of the children, the father's move 16 miles closer to the mother, his being able to transport the children to school, his new marriage and new child, and the passage of Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.24(4)(a)2, which did not, as he argued, mandate equal time. Ordering the father to pay the entire guardian ad litem fee was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent sex offender appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which denied his motion to enforce the trial court's previous order directing that he be released from the custody to which he was committed as a &quot;sexually violent person&quot; under Wis. Stat. ch. 980.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender sexually assaulted a four-year-old boy for whom he was babysitting. The offender had previously molested several siblings and neighbors. The trial court directed the Department of Health and Family Services and the county to prepare a plan to treat the offender on supervised release in the community. When, after several years, the offender was still being detained in secure custody, the trial court ruled that the offender's constitutional rights were violated and ordered his immediate release. Subsequently, however, the trial court found that the offender was no longer suitable for supervised release because of his dangerous mental condition. The court held that, given the offender's horrendous history of predatory sexual violence against children, the good-faith inability of the responsible persons to comply with the trial court's orders neither shocked the conscience nor trespassed on rights implicit in concepts of ordered liberty. Accordingly, the offender had not shown, by any standard, that he was deprived of substantive due process by the application of Wis. Stat. ch. 980 to him. Moreover, all of ch. 980's procedural safeguards were scrupulously applied to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State petitioned to terminate the father's parental rights pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(1), (2), and (6), and later amended its petition to allege that grounds for termination existed under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(2) and (4). The father entered a no contest plea and waiver to the termination petition. The father argued that the circuit court was without jurisdiction to terminate his parental rights, because Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(4) was a facially unconstitutional statute, as it permitted the State to sidestep its duty to prove parental unfitness. The appellate court ruled that the issue was whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.424(4), read in conjunction with Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(4), was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. The appellate court ruled that the father failed to satisfy his burden of showing that the statutory scheme was unconstitutional. The statutory scheme reflected a Wisconsin Legislative determination that satisfaction of Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(4) constituted a sufficient showing of unfitness. The father failed to address whether the Legislative determination was sufficiently narrowly tailored to meet constitutional standards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence at trial indicated that defendant acted as a lookout while her co-defendant pried a soap vending machine from a wall, attempted to pry open a vending machine, and attempted to remove coins from a commercial washing machine. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court's instructions to the jury erroneously contained a mandatory conclusive presumption and that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction. The appellate court noted that a jury instruction directing a jury to accept as true a judicially noticed fact that constituted an element of the crime was indistinguishable from a mandatory conclusive presumption on an elemental fact, which was unconstitutional; however, that type of constitutional instructional error was subject to the harmless error rule. The appellate court held that the trial court's jury instruction was harmless error, in that it was clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found defendant guilty absent the error. The appellate court concluded that, by breaking into the coin mechanic component of the commercial washing machine, defendant and her accomplice unlawfully entered a locked coin box.</SPAN></P>

He represented in the prior trial a full understanding of his rights to testify or not to testify in that matter. His attorney represented on the record in that matter that he fully understood his rights and options in that regard, and I am fully satisfied that defendant understands what the situation was and made an informed, knowing and voluntary decision. At the Machner hearing, counsel testified that defendant never told him before the defense rested that he wanted to testify. In contrast, defendant claimed that he told his counsel that he had to testify to prove his innocence. The trial court adopted the State's proposed finding that defendant told his attorney after the defense witnesses had testified that he still did not want to testify. Therefore, the evidence showed that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to testify.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent father appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin) requiring him to pay child support arrearages in the amount of $ 24,690 and interest of $ 42,612. The trial court determined that he was not entitled to assert equitable estoppel against petitioner mother and that he was not entitled to credit for any sums paid to her outside of the terms of the judgment for child support issued by the court in 1982.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the retroactive application of Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.32(1r) (2001-02) was unconstitutional. He conceded the mother's action was filed in April 2001, long after his ability to use equitable estoppel came to an end in 1993 when the legislature amended &sect; 767.32(1m) to add language providing that the courts could not revise &quot;an amount of arrearages in child support that has accrued, prior to the date that notice of the action is given to the respondent.&quot; 1993 Wis. Laws 481, &sect; 118. However, the father argued that the change in the law came after he relied upon the mother's agreement that he would pay private school tuition for the child until graduation in lieu of paying child support. The instant court concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.32(1r) (2001-02) properly balanced the public interest in requiring parents to provide for the financial support of their children and the need to monitor the fulfillment of that obligation against the ability of the parties to make alternate or &quot;off the record&quot; agreements. Compliance with &sect; 767.32(1r) was within the control of the father. The instant court rejected the constitutional challenge to the statute's retroactive application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an owner of a holding tank for sewage, appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Wood County, Wisconsin, which ordered a civil forfeiture of $ 500 plus costs pursuant to Wood County, Wis., Private Sewage System Ord. (PSSO) 702.09(2) after the owner failed to pay plaintiff county an annual reporting service fee under PSSO 702.04(4)A.3.d.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">PSSO 702.04(4)A.3.d required tank owners to pay an annual reporting service fee of $ 36, the amount that was required per tank by the county's contract with a company that designed, installed, and maintained an alarm system to report the conditions of holding tanks. In affirming the forfeiture, the court held that: (1) Wis. Stat. &sect; 145.20(4) authorized the county to assess tank owners for costs relating to the pumping of a holding tank; (2) the $ 36 was a fee, not a special assessment or tax because the amount charged was the cost of maintaining the reporting system and thus recovered costs rather than raising revenue; the fee did not serve the general benefit of the public but rather held tank owners responsible for the costs of recordkeeping related to monitoring tanks; (3) the ordinance did not violate equal protection, but appropriately charged only tank owners for the cost of services; (4) the county could contract with a private business for recordkeeping services, and the contract did not unlawfully bargain away the county's police power; and (5) the permit fee and recordkeeping fees were separate charges and were not redundant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of underage consumption of alcohol, in violation of Fond du Lac County, Wis., Ordinances &sect; 6-1 (adopting Wis. Stat. &sect; 125.07(4)(b) (2001-02)), in the Circuit Court for Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin. Defendant appealed, asserting that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over him because the violation of the underage drinking ordinance was a civil action and required a summons and complaint for proper service of process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that a summons and complaint was required for proper service. Pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 800.01(1)(a) (2001-02), proper service occurred in cases involving a violation of a municipal ordinance when a citation was issued. Because defendant's underage consumption of alcohol was a violation of a municipal ordinance, a citation was proper service of process, and the trial court had jurisdiction. The appellate court also held that Fond du Lac County, Wis., Ordinances &sect; 6-1 (adopting Wis. Stat. &sect; 125.07(4)(b) (2001-02)), which regulated the consumption of alcoholic beverages by underaged persons was constitutional. The State had broad power to regulate the liquor industry and underage drinking. Such regulation served the purpose of protecting the safety of persons who might be injured as a result of the intoxication of underage persons, as well as for the health and morals of the underage persons themselves. Fond du Lac County derived its authority to pass municipal ordinances relating to underage drinking from Wis. Stat. ch. 125 (2001-02). Therefore, Fond du Lac County possessed the authority to regulate underage consumption of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The officer had a rough description of the hit-and-run driver and vehicle, and he had confirmation of the vehicle's registered owner's name and address. When the officer arrived at the address, he found defendant, who matched the suspect's physical description. When the officer advised defendant that he wanted to discuss an accident, defendant asked whether anyone was hurt as opposed to denying any involvement in an accident. Defendant did not suggest someone else had used his vehicle that evening. The officer noticed that defendant seemed intoxicated, another factor about the driver that had been reported. Taken as a whole, the officer made a logical conclusion based on his knowledge at the time of the arrest. Therefore, the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court for Washington County, Wisconsin, which convicted him of seventh offense operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI), Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a) (2001-02), and denied him motion for postconviction relief. Defendant argued that the sentencing court erroneously imposed a fine according to a local sentencing guideline and failed to consider his ability to pay the fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court concluded that a maximum term of confinement was not required but a maximum &quot;overall sentence&quot; was necessary and therefore imposed a fine, making reference to local guidelines. The court reversed as to the trial court's failure to make a determination as to defendant's ability to pay the fine, an issue that defendant timely raised in his postconviction motion. A hearing was necessary to avoid an unconstitutional application of the statutes. The court affirmed the remainder of the judgment, finding that although local sentencing guidelines were only applicable to prohibited alcohol concentration offenses, it was not error, and therefore not unconstitutional, to make reference to local guidelines when sentencing for an OWI offense. There was also no requirement that the trial court give separate reasons for imposing jail time than it gave for imposing a fine. It was a proper exercise of discretion to highlight aggravating factors rather than mitigating factors where the trial court specifically characterized the case as &quot;aggravated&quot; and identified the factors that led it to that characterization.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed as to the failure to determine defendant's ability to pay the fine and remanded the cause with directions. The court otherwise affirmed the decision.</SPAN></P>

There was no evidence that the police were concerned about the breath test being in any way unsatisfactory or unusable and the officer testified that he did not request the blood test for the purpose of detecting the presence of controlled substances. The suppression of the evidence of the blood test was affirmed because once an individual who was arrested on probable cause for operating a vehicle while intoxicated provided a satisfactory and useable chemical test, the exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless and nonconsensual blood draw no longer existed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, appellant veterans post (VFW) challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) that granted a writ of assistance to appellee City redevelopment authority to evict VFW from its leased property and from the non-final order directing the county condemnation commission panel to apply the &quot;unit rule&quot; to determine &quot;fair market value,&quot; under Wis. Stat. &sect; 32.09(5)(a) (2001-02), of the VFW's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate question was whether, under &sect; 32.09(5)(a), the City had to pay the VFW anything more than the &quot;fair market value&quot; of the property as determined under the &quot;unit rule&quot;? The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, District One, concluded that the case law, including the appellate court's recent decision in Dotty, yielded an equally clear answer: No. The VFW argued that if the appellate court affirmed the circuit court's order requiring application of the &quot;unit rule,&quot; it would have been barred from presenting evidence regarding the value of its lease and it would receive nothing as compensation for the termination of its lease. It was undisputed that, at the point that condemnation effectively terminated VFW's lease, 60 years remained and the lease value, without any adjustment for inflation, exceeded eight million dollars. The City responded, however, that the value of VFW's lease was not a proper component in the determination of the property's &quot;fair market value.&quot; Notwithstanding the court's considerable sympathy for the VFW, it saw no basis on which to distinguish the instant case from Dotty and, therefore, had no authority to grant VFW its requested relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee wives of decedent iron workers brought a negligence action against a crane manufacturer and a general contractor, and sought compensatory and punitive damages. The jury awarded $ 5,250,000 in compensatory damages and $ 94,000,000 in punitive damages. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) denied the contractor's post-verdict motions. The contractor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The construction workers were killed when a crane, leased by the contractor, collapsed and they fell to their deaths. The dispositive issue was, whether, based on the facts as conceded by the wives, the punitive-damage award was contrary to the calls of Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.85(3) (1999-2000). The Court of Appeal of Wisconsin, District One, held that it was. The appellate court held that the phrase &quot;intentional disregard of the rights of the plaintiff&quot; in &sect; 895.85(3) could only have been reasonably interpreted to have required either an intent by a defendant to cause injury to the plaintiffs or knowledge that the defendant's conduct was practically certain to cause the accident or injury to the plaintiffs. Based on that conclusion, together with the concession by both the wives and the trial court that there was no evidence demonstrating that the contractor intended to cause injury or knew that its conduct was practically certain to cause injury, the award of punitive damages was reversed. Based on the foregoing, the trial court's interpretation of the statute was erroneous. Having reached that conclusion, the trial court also erred in submitting the punitive damages issue to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, 14 City of Milwaukee property-taxpayers, appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) that dismissed their actions brought under Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37 against appellee City for property-tax refunds. The trial court granted the City's motion to dismiss the consolidated cases and held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37 could not be used to challenge tax assessments on property in the City of Milwaukee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that despite Nankin, &sect; 74.37 could not be used to challenge tax assessments on property in the City of Milwaukee. Before Nankin, &sect; 74.37 could only be used to challenge tax assessments on property located outside of Milwaukee County. Nankin declared that restriction unconstitutional. Nankin declared that &sect; 74.37(6) violated the rights of Milwaukee County taxpayers to equal protection of the law guaranteed by Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. But the remainder of &sect; 74.37, remained fully operative. The appellate court held that it would have defeated the intent of the legislature to apply provisions that were once, but no longer were, consistent with Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37, to deprive County property-taxpayers the use of &sect; 74.37 merely because those taxpayers sought to contest their City of Milwaukee tax assessments. There was no indication that the specific January 31 deadline was essential to any legislative purpose in connection with claims brought by Milwaukee County taxpayers and the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, District One, saw no reason why the &quot;3rd Monday in May&quot; deadline could not be applied to taxpayers using &sect; 74.37 to challenge their property assessments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a municipal court trial, defendant was found guilty of parking a truck on a residential lot, in violation of Madison, WI, General Ord. &sect; 28.11(3)(a)1, which limited parking to passenger vehicles with less that a one-ton capacity. Defendant filed a timely appeal to the Dane County Circuit Court, Wisconsin, opting for a de novo bench trial. The circuit court upheld the decision, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that, because the terms &quot;passenger truck,&quot; &quot;capacity,&quot; and &quot;ton&quot; were not defined by the ordinance, Wis. Stat. &sect; 349.03(1) required courts to defer to statutory definitions. The court disagreed, reasoning that the ordinance was a zoning regulation, not a traffic regulation within &sect; 349.03(1). Further, the regulation was expressly authorized by &quot;some other provision of the statutes,&quot; as allowed by &sect; 349.03(1)(b), specifically the statutory authority to enact zoning regulations. The court also held that defendant did not have standing to challenge the regulation on the basis that it was unconstitutionally vague. The court reasoned that the truck had a &quot;capacity&quot; of over three tons and that therefore defendant's conduct was clearly proscribed. In arriving at that conclusion, the court used the value specified by the manufacturer rather than post-manufacture, &quot;modified loaded weight,&quot; as argued by defendant, to determine the truck's capacity. The statute of limitations was not a bar. Although defendant had been parking his truck in the lot for 10 years, the statute did not run from the first day of a continuing violation, but from the day the violation ceased.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 948.02(2), 939.50(3)(6c), and 939.32 (2001-02).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose from a prosecution for child enticement and attempted sexual assault resulting from an ongoing Internet sting operation. The State appealed from an order dismissing the charge against defendant for child enticement and defendant cross-appealed from the order, which denied his motion to dismiss the charge of attempted sexual assault. The court reversed in part, stating that Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.07 (2001-02) did not violate defendant's First amendment rights. While the agent posing as a minor conducted much of the discussions regarding the putative sexual activity, defendant's appearance at the prearranged site signaled probable cause to believe that he had the intent to proceeding with the criminal sexual activity discussed between the two. The complaint charging attempted child enticement alleged sufficient facts to establish probable cause that defendant attempted to entice a child. On remand, the circuit court was ordered to reinstate the charge of attempted child enticement. Arranging a time and place were acts in furtherance of defendant's criminal objective; thus, there was probable cause that defendant attempted to sexually assault a child under the age of 16.</SPAN></P>

He also challenged the denial of his motion for retroactive modification of a child-support order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father claimed that the physical-placement statutes violated the Due-Process Clause because they deprived him of a fundamental liberty interest of equally participating in the raising of his children. Although noting that parents had a fundamental right to the care and custody of their children, the court held that this did not mean that parents had a fundamental right to equal placement periods after a divorce. Therefore, the father's right to substantive due process was not violated. He also failed to show that the procedures were constitutionally inadequate. He had an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time in a meaningful manner, participating in nine hearings over the course of three years. Under the Equal Protection Clause, the father did not show how or where the physical-placement statutes created an impermissible classification when he argued that fathers as a group prevailed in only about 10 percent of cases. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by not applying administrative changes to existing child-support guidelines that had not yet been adopted. Neither parent was entitled to costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which affirmed a decision of defendant Labor and Industry Review Commission (LIRC) of the Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations that denied unemployment compensation after defendant city challenged an appeal tribunal decision ruling that the employee had terminated her employment with good cause under Wis. Stat. &sect; 108.04(7)(b) (2001-02).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the city's police department, which had a residency requirement in its collective bargaining agreement. After becoming engaged to a sheriff's department investigator in another county that also had a residency requirement, the employee sought an exemption from her department's residency requirement so that she could live with her husband. After multiple unsuccessful attempts at obtaining an exemption, the employee moved, in violation of the residency requirement. She was terminated and initially found ineligible for unemployment compensation as having terminated her employment within the meaning of &sect; 108.04(7)(a). The employee appealed from a final decision holding that she had voluntarily terminated her employment without good cause attributable to the city. Applying a deferential standard of review, the court held that the employee's act of moving in violation of the residency requirement was inconsistent with the continuation of the employer-employee relationship and she therefore voluntarily terminated her employment. Further, despite her unfortunate situation, the employee failed to demonstrate that she had good cause to terminate her employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed LIRC's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A search warrant had been issued for the house where defendant was staying as a guest. Drugs were found in the bedroom where defendant was staying. The warrant had been issued on the basis of an officer's affidavit, which claimed an anonymous tip informed the officer that drugs were going to be delivered to the house. Specifically, defendant argued that the anticipatory search warrant lacked sufficient probable cause and failed to set forth the conditions precedent for the warrant's execution. The appellate court ruled that anticipatory search warrants were constitutional and did not need to explicitly state the conditions precedent for the warrant's execution. Here, the affidavit named the driver of a dark colored conversion van with lots of windows, which was to deliver the marijuana to the house for a large birthday party, which a record check indicated would be on a specific date. The information was sufficient for the magistrate to have found that the drugs would be present at the house on the day of the birthday.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's postconviction motion was denied. He appealed, asserting his sentencing was unconstitutional and that his statements were obtained in violation of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer saw defendant's car collide with the victims' car. The officer saw defendant get out of his car and run away from the accident scene. After being apprehended, but before being either questioned or advised of his Miranda rights, the officer claimed that defendant blurted out, &quot;I knew you were going to come after me, so I tried to get away.&quot; Defendant was taken to a nearby hospital and read his Miranda rights. Defendant then admitted to being the driver of the car. Later, he was again advised of his Miranda rights, after which he gave the police a more extensive statement admitting his involvement in the accident. The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that the subject statements were inadmissible. The first statement was voluntary, despite the fact that defendant was in custody and not advised of his constitutional rights. The abbreviated statement at the hospital was voluntary and admissible, as defendant's argument he could not recall being Mirandized was not credible. As to his third statement, defendant never invoked his right to silence. Finally, the truth-in-sentencing law that called for determinate sentences was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the inmate contended the trial court erred in dismissing his petition. Contrary to the department's contention, the appellate court found that the department's denial of the inmate's request for declaratory judgment ruling did not prevent him from seeking a declaratory ruling in the trial court with respect to the challenged rule. However, the department was not obligated to issue a declaratory judgment ruling regarding the validity of the rule under Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.41(1) (2001-02), as the inmate was not seeking a ruling with respect to the applicability of the rule to him, but, rather, on the constitutionality of the rule. As the inmate's substantial interests were not adversely affected by the department's action, the inmate was required to comply with Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.40(1) (2001-02) in order to receive judicial review of the proposed rule. Because the inmate's summons and complaint were not filed together, he failed to initiate a civil action for declaratory judgment with the trial court and, therefore, the trial court lacked competency to hear his complaint. The inmate's parole from prison rendered his request for review of his disciplinary action moot.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, dismissed the complaint and assessed a strike against the prisoner. The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Another inmate borrowed the decision from the prisoner and attempted to return it by mail to the prisoner. That was when prison authorities confiscated and destroyed the decision. The prisoner asserted such action was vindictive and intended to, and did, interfere with his right to be represented by counsel of choice and his right to access to the courts. The department asserted the mailing of the opinion from the other inmate violated the rule against unauthorized transfers of property, pursuant to Wis. Admin. Code &sect; DOC 303.40. The appellate court noted that &sect; DOC 303.40 required prisoners to obtain prior authorization from prison officials before sending legal materials. Therefore, if the prisoner truly was providing legal services, he could have gotten prior authorization to send the document to the other inmate, and the other inmate could have done likewise before mailing it back. Because the prisoner's certiorari complaint did not allege that the other inmate obtained prior authorization before sending the decision back to him, he failed to state a claim that the departmental review decision was incorrect in concluding the transfer was unauthorized.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court also held the circuit court properly assessed a &quot;strike&quot; against the prisoner, as the matter was dismissed for failure to state a claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant event organizer appealed from a judgment and an order of the Circuit Court for Sauk County (Wisconsin), which granted plaintiff county's request to enjoin the organizer's event from taking place due to the fact that no license had been obtained under the county's open-air assembly ordinance. The trial court held that Sauk County, Wis., Code of Ordinance &sect; 12.01 et seq. was constitutional and dismissed the organizer's counterclaims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organizer intended to hold his event, which promoted legalization of hemp and marijuana, without first obtaining the necessary permit. The county obtained a temporary restraint. Thereafter, the trial court granted summary judgment to the county, holding the ordinance constitutional and permanently enjoining the event until such time as the permit was obtained. The trial court held that the ordinance satisfied the criteria for a constitutional time, place, and manner regulation, that it was content-neutral, and that, under the standards set out in Forsyth, it was constitutional. On appeal, the court thoroughly reviewed the provisions of the ordinance under a First Amendment analysis and determined that there were various provisions that were not narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest. These included the time period for processing and filing the license, the prohibition on advertising and promotion of the event prior to obtaining the license, the zoning certification requirement, and the license fee above the flat rate of $ 100 per application. The processing time requirement could not be severed without causing an invalidation of the entire ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment dismissal of the organizer's counterclaim with respect to challenging the ordinance's constitutionality and ordered judgment in his favor, finding it unconstitutional. It reversed the order permanently enjoining him from holding his event without a license under the ordinance. The court affirmed the trial court's order dismissing the organizer's other counterclaims and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Waushara County (Wisconsin) of 18 counts of possession of child pornography. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause. The court of appeals disagreed. The cut-up pictures found in defendant's trash established that he retained his interest in juvenile males as sex objects. Defendant had internet access and had visited an internet site where visual child pornography was available for downloading. The narratives he printed out explicitly described sexual encounters between adults and juvenile males. Defendant's computer was a significant tool in allowing him access to children, and to child pornography, and there existed ample probable cause justifying the search of defendant's computer files. Authorizing the seizure of every photograph of a child was reasonable when investigating the crime of child exploitation. Even lawful photographs could help to identify children with whom the accused had interacted, thereby aiding in the discovery of other victims. The affidavit and warrant were not defective. Reviewed in the context of a child pornography and sexual exploitation investigation, the items to be seized were described with sufficient particularity and provided adequate guidance for the executing officer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county passed a zoning ordinance (the riverway ordinance) to regulate a portion of the Lower St. Croix River that lay within the County. The County then amended the riverway ordinance leaving a portion of the river without zoning adequate to meet appellee State's mandate. The State sued to nullify the amendment, and the Circuit Court for St. Croix County (Wisconsin) granted its motion for summary judgment. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The County contended that the State was prohibited from enacting statutes requiring ordinances controlling the portion of the St. Croix River that was federally administrated under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1271 et seq., because Congress preempted regulation in that zone and also because Congress did not specifically state that local governments could regulate in the federal zone. The State contended that federal administration did not encompass zoning regulation, that local and federal regulations could co-exist in the federal zone, so long as the local regulations did not conflict with the Act, and that there was no conflict in the instant matter. The appellate court agreed with the State and concluded the State retained the power to authorize zoning in the federal zone at issue. Furthermore, given the Act's stated areas of federal and state cooperation, the absence of any explicit or implicit statement of federal preemption and the cooperation evidenced in the master plan, the federal government had not preempted the regulation of the Lower St. Croix River in either the federal or the state zone.  Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.27 (2001-02) remained in full force and effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court nullifying the amendment to the County's riverway zoning because it was enacted in excess of the power granted to the County by the State was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the circuit court for Walworth County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI). The sole issue on appeal was whether the trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained subsequent to a traffic stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trooper pulled defendant over for failing to change lanes while an emergency vehicle was parked on the side of the road, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.072. As a result of this stop, defendant was charged with OWI. In affirming, the court found that evidence in the record supported the factual findings. Although the trooper did not recall whether he waved his flashlight at the car, a ride-along officer testified that he did so. He also testified that the car passed within five feet of the squad car without moving over and that there was no traffic that would have prevented defendant from pulling into the opposite lane of traffic. Defendant and his passenger testified to contrary facts. Defendant argued that the trial court created a &quot;third version&quot; of the facts not found in the record in order to support its conclusions that there was probable cause for the traffic violation and that the stop did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court noted that a trier of fact could do just that, as long as the finding was supported by the record. The trial court simply heard the conflicting testimony and made a judgment based on credibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress and affirmed the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

As a condition of probation, the trial court ordered defendant not to enter a specified portion of the city where the crime occurred. Defendant's sentence was affirmed, as: (1) the condition imposed did not violate a constitutional right to travel, in that the condition was not overly broad, it was reasonably related to a legitimate protective purpose to give peace of mind to the community, and it was appropriate to provide a margin of territorial safety where victims could live in peace; and (2) given defendant's extensive criminal background and the viciousness of the crime, the sentence imposed was not unduly harsh or excessive, in that it did not exceed the maximum sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried for murder; his accomplices were given reduced sentence for their testimony against him. Defendant claimed that the trial judge was biased because he refused to recuse himself from defendant's postconviction motion and because he had made comments during trial that implied that the prosecutor's improper comments and objectionable actions did not matter. Defendant also claimed that the prosecutor committed misconduct, the trial court made several evidentiary rulings, and improperly instructed the jury. The appellate court held that a trial judge would generally oversee the postconviction motions, and that the judge's comments to defendant about allowing the prosecutor to argue the case without continual objections from defendant did not show judicial bias. The appellate court also held that the prosecutor's comments during closing, and the trial judge's rulings on evidence were not an abuse of discretion, and, at most, resulted in harmless error. Finally, the trial judge did not err in allowing the county coroner to testify that it was likely that more than one person committed the murder, as the coroner had specialized training in death investigation.</SPAN></P>

The underlying action arose when the committee later granted the neighbor the variance. The trial court ruled that under applicable county zoning ordinances, a variance was unnecessary and thus affirmed the committee's granting of the conditional use permit, striking the variance requirement as surplusage. On review, the landowners contended, inter alia, that applicable county ordinances required a variance and that the committee lacked jurisdiction to grant the variance. The appellate court agreed, finding that the county board of adjustment had exclusive authority to grant variances. Further, even if the committee did have jurisdiction to grant the variance, the granting of the variance was unsupported by the evidence of record as the neighbor failed to establish &quot;no reasonable use&quot; of the property and, hence, did not establish unnecessary hardship in the absence of a variance.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant's van was creating a potential traffic hazard while already stopped on the roadway when the officer activated his emergency lights and walked to the van to see what was wrong. Thus, the officer's action did not intrude on defendant's freedom to leave. Although the record was not clear as to why the officer activated the emergency lights, it was reasonable to infer that it was for safety reasons under the circumstances. The public interest in the officer checking on the driver parked on a roadway in the early morning hours outweighed the minimal intrusion involved. In addition, the officer observed the van at 2:04 a.m. weaving within its lane of travel numerous times and for several blocks. He then observed the van stop in the middle of its traffic lane for no apparent reason and remain stopped in the lane for approximately 45 seconds with the driver sitting in the van.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Prior to the witness's testimony, the trial court held several discussions with defense counsel and the prosecutor concerning the appropriate scope of cross-examination. Defense counsel argued that he should have been able to question the witness about what counsel characterized as &quot;the break&quot; he received in sentencing as a result of his statement. The trial court did not prohibit questions concerning the terms of the plea agreement. Rather, it suggested that questions concerning the plea agreement would be appropriate. Defense counsel was able to and, in fact, did question the witness about his charges and whether he expected to get a benefit from testifying. However, eliciting information about the actual sentence imposed was not relevant to any incentives the prosecution gave him for testifying on behalf of the State. Therefore, defendant's right to confrontation was not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, that &sect; 302.095(2) was unconstitutionally vague, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, and his conviction should have been reversed in the interest of justice. The appellate court rejected defendant's claims. Inter alia, the court held that taking items out of the prison for an inmate, and particularly the transaction for which defendant was to have been paid $ 500, constituted providing a service for an inmate, in violation of the fraternization policy. The appellate court held that it was not necessary to rely on the separate work rule prohibition against delivering articles to an inmate in violation of &sect; 302.095. A reasonable person reading the fraternization policy and the work rules would have understood that taking items out of the prison for inmates was prohibited by the work rules and would understand that receiving items from an inmate for that purpose was prohibited by &sect; 302.095(2). Indeed, when confronted with evidence of his actions, defendant told the police that, inter alia, he &quot;knew it was wrong&quot; to take the items from the prison. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant car dealer sought declaratory relief to prevent appellee developer from developing, for retail purposes, land he purchased in a city's industrial park. The Circuit Court for Dunn County (Wisconsin) determined that Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.1101 (2001-02) did not apply and that the zoning classification permitted commercial retail use of the property. The court entered summary judgment dismissing the car dealer's claim. The car dealer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The car dealer argued that &sect; 66.1101(3) prohibited the development, for other than industrial purposes, of the 6 acres the developer purchased. The appellate court held that &sect; 66.1101(3) did not apply. The city purchased and developed the land without benefit of the financing mechanisms under &sect; 66.1101. The land was not a site purchased for &quot;industrial development&quot; under &sect; 66.1101. As a result, the limiting provisions of subsection (3) did not apply, and the section did not prohibit the developer's commercial retail development and use of the property. The land sales policy adopted by the city stated that the city purchased land to expand its economic base and attract business and industry to the area. The city could have rationally concluded that selling the 6 acres for more than half of what the total 73 acres cost the city and the construction of a new automobile dealership on the site would have benefitted the city and attracted other business and industry to the site. Because increasing the tax base and improving the economic climate were public purposes consistent with the sale of the land for retail development, the sale did not violate the public purpose doctrine.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant did not make a reasonable objection, not because his professed theology was unsound, but because he furnished absolutely no support for his claims of church membership or church doctrine. In addition, the officers informed him of what they were going to do before they did it, and he refused to cooperate. Later, halfway through the process, he offered to cooperate, if they would let him sit up. The trial court found that offer was &quot;a whimsical change of mind&quot; that was not credible under the facts and circumstances. Because the methods used to obtain the blood draw were reasonable under the circumstances, and defendant made no reasonable objection to the procedure, the judgment denying the motion to suppress the results of the blood sample analysis was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had been arrested by a police officer for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants (OMVWI), argued that the trial court erred in denying his motions to suppress evidence of the result of a blood alcohol test performed following his arrest. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the blood sample should not have been analyzed without a warrant. However, defendant acknowledged that the Wisconsin Supreme Court's holding in a 2002 case and the instant court's holding in a 2002 case effectively disposed of these issues adversely to him. Defendant did not mention a 2003 case in which the instant court held that police do not need a warrant to perform a test for alcohol concentration on a blood sample properly seized from an OMVWI arrestee. The instant court was bound by these precedents, and it affirmed both the denial of defendant's suppression motions and his conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment and order of the Circuit Court for Brown County, Wisconsin, convicting him of two counts of sexual assault of a student by school staff and one count each of fourth-degree sexual assault and disorderly conduct and denying his motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a high school boys' and girls' swim coach during the 1998-99 school year and was not a teacher, nor did he hold any other position at the school. Defendant was charged with several crimes stemming from allegations that he had sexual contact with four members of the girls' team. On appeal, defendant only challenged the conviction of sexual assault of a student stemming from the March 14, 1999, incident. Defendant argued the only way he could have been liable under Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.095 (1997-1998) was if he was under contract on March 14, and the jury should have been so instructed. While defendant's coaching duties were done at the end of the boys' season on February 20, defendant had out-of-season contact with the school and his athletes. The appellate court ruled that the evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that defendant was providing services to the school or school board when he committed the alleged assault. The appropriate interpretation of the statute was to view an &quot;employe&quot; and persons &quot;under contract&quot; as examples of persons included within the group of people that provided services to a school or school board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, company and property owners, sought a rezoning of the owners' property for an ethanol plant. Appellant town and appellant county approved the change. Respondent citizens group filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to find the rezoning illegal. The Winnebago County Circuit Court (Wisconsin) found the rezoning was unconstitutional spot zoning, but dismissed the group's claim of invalidity and nuisance. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, appellants argued that the rezoning decisions did not constitute illegal spot zoning. The appellate court noted that because the parcel was granted privileges that were not granted to other land in the vicinity, this was spot zoning. However, the zoning was not illegal because the zoning would benefit the community and not just the interested partied. The town and county also considered the site plan, odor emissions, noise and traffic considerations, employment and tax base considerations, fire control considerations, water considerations and the general effects of zoning gradation for future objectives of planning. Thus, the court reinstated the town's and the county's zoning decisions. Appellees cross-appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the rezoning was null and void because the town failed to follow necessary notice requirements. The appellate court disagreed because the town complied with all state notice requirements but failed to comply with its local ordinance requirements. Failure to comply with the town's notice requirements, when all statutory notice requirements were met, did not defeat the purpose of the ordinance's notice provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rezoning was not illegal spot zoning, therefore, that portion of the judgment was reversed and remanded with directions to reinstate the town's and the county's rezoning decisions. The judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) dismissing their claim that the assessment for the cost of removing gravel and dirt and for legal fees levied by respondent, the Town of Bristol, was unlawful and void. The landowners also sought review of the trial court's determination that the claim was frivolous, an award of attorney fees, and the entry of a protective order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute arose between the landowners and their neighbors concerning a drainage ditch that crossed the landowners' property, carrying water from a wetland on the neighboring farm. After the Town sent the landowners the assessment, the landowners filed a petition for a writ of mandamus. The court agreed with the trial court that the claim was time-barred by Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.72 insofar as it challenged the assessment for the cost of removing gravel and dirt. However, the court concluded the Town was without power to make an assessment for the legal fees. Therefore, the one-year limitation in &sect; 893.72 did not apply. Attorney's fees were properly assessed against the landowners in connection with their motion for reconsideration because the motion raised arguments that the trial court had previously held were frivolous. The trial court properly exercised its discretion in determining that the landowners' counsel violated Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 20:4.2 when counsel signed, swore to, and filed a petition containing facts that were not true at the time, because the events referenced therein had not yet transpired. As such, sanctions were proper under Wis. Stat. &sect; 802.05(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court judgment, which had dismissed the claim and awarded attorney fees, and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The court affirmed the award of attorney's fees imposed for the frivolous motion for reconsideration, the protective order, the attorney fees imposed for the frivolous objection and for the frivolous motion for reconsideration, and the sanction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the circuit court erred by denying his motion for plea withdrawal; and his convictions for recklessly endangering safety violated double jeopardy. The appellate court found that, consistent with the appellate court's instructions on remand, the circuit court conducted a hearing concerning defendant's motion for plea withdrawal and determined that trial counsel was deficient and properly exercised its discretion to select resentencing as the appropriate remedy. As to his double jeopardy claim, where multiple persons were endangered by reckless conduct, multiple convictions under the statute were not multiplicitous. As 4 different people were endangered by defendant's reckless conduct, the 4 convictions for reckless endangerment were not multiplicitous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner department of human services sought to terminate respondent mother's parental rights to her children under the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(7) (2001-02). The mother moved to dismiss, and the Circuit Court for Monroe County (Wisconsin) denied the motion. After a disposition hearing, the circuit court terminated the mother's parental rights. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was the victim of her father's sexual assaults while she was under the age of 13, and the mother's father was the father of all of her children. The mother contended that the ground of incestuous parenthood, Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(7) (2001-02), was unconstitutional as applied to her, as she was the victim of her father's assaults. The appellate court found that: (1) the mother had a fundamental liberty interest in parenting her children, regardless of the fact that they were born out of an incestuous relationship; (2) the incestuous parenthood of the children did not, in itself, show that the mother was an unfit parent, as the mother was a minor, a victim of sexual assault, and she did not want to raise the children with her father as a parent; (3) the trial court's discretion to decide not to terminate parental rights did not satisfy the requirements of due process; and (4) the application of Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(7) (2001-02) to the mother and the finding of unfitness violated her right to substantive due process, as the fact that the other parent of the mother's children was her father did not, in itself, make the mother an unfit parent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Green County Circuit Court, Wisconsin, which convicted him for operating while intoxicated, as a second offense within 10 years, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a) (2001-2002) and Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.65(2)(b) (2001-2002).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it denied his motions to suppress the results the blood draw taken incident to his arrest. When defendant was stopped for speeding, a police officer noticed that defendant's eyes were bloodshot, his speech was slurred, and there was a strong odor of intoxicants on his breath. Defendant failed field sobriety tests and a preliminary breath test reading was .16 percent. Defendant subsequently submitted to a blood draw. Analysis of the blood sample showed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.171 percent. The instant court noted that defendant did not challenge the probable cause for his arrest. The instant court was presented solely with questions of law regarding the constitutionality of the implied consent law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(2) (2001-2002), and the analysis of defendant's blood sample. It concluded that the trial court properly denied defendant's motions to suppress the results of his blood test and correctly concluded that the implied consent statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it denied his motions to suppress the results of the blood draw taken incident to his arrest. Defendant argued that the blood draw and analysis of the blood sample was a warrantless seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The appellate court noted that the exigent circumstances exception to the Fourth Amendment allowed the police, following an arrest for operating while intoxicated supported by probable cause, to perform a blood test for alcohol concentration, regardless of the existence of a breathalyzer. Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(2) required an individual arrested for OWI to choose between submitting to a blood draw or immediately losing his driving privileges. Section 343.305(2) was not unconstitutional because, even if the coercive event occurred when the officer read the &quot;Informing the Accused&quot; form, as opposed to when the individual applied for a driver's license, the limited intrusion posed by a blood draw was reasonable when weighed against the State's interest in protecting the public from intoxicated drivers. The analysis of blood after it was drawn was not a second search subject to Fourth Amendment protections.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff relatives sued defendants, correctional officer, sheriff, and county, for the death of the decedent, who committed suicide while in the county jail. The Circuit Court for Rock County, Wisconsin, dismissed the relatives' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims against all defendants and dismissed state law negligence claims against the sheriff. The relatives appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent, a pretrial detainee, filled out a form during the booking process as to whether he had ever attempted or was considering suicide. The decedent placed a small mark in the &quot;no&quot; column and a larger check in the &quot;yes&quot; column. The officer said that it was his practice to review yes answers with the detainees. The officer did not recall following that practice with the decedent, but was sure that he had and that the decedent had indicated he was not presently considering suicide. The decedent committed suicide six days later. The appellate court affirmed the grant of summary judgment on the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims as the court noted defendants were not &quot;deliberately indifferent&quot; to the risk that the decedent would commit suicide. As &quot;deliberate indifference&quot; was greater than negligence, the relatives failed to show that defendants knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to the decedent's safety. There was no liability by the officer in his official capacity, and thus no liability on the county, as the relatives failed to prove that the sheriff had an unconstitutional practice, policy, or custom that deprived the decedent of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of several crimes after helping prisoners escape from jail. As part of her probationary sentence, defendant was ordered to serve some active jail time. The trial court declined to place defendant on home monitoring. After the sentence was imposed, the sheriff placed defendant on home monitoring. The trial court then amended its judgment to preclude the sheriff from placing defendant in the program. Defendant then sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the trial court's order improperly infringed upon the executive branch's authority. Once the sentence was imposed, the adversary system was terminated. The sheriff had the discretion to place prisoners on home monitoring under Wis. Stat. &sect; 302.425(2). The decision to place a prisoner on home monitoring was best decided by the sheriff of a particular county, who was vested with the oversight of the county jail under Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant conceded that, under precedent, the warrantless seizure of his blood did not violate the Fourth Amendment, as it came within the exception to the warrant requirement for exigent circumstances. However, he contended the analysis of his blood was a separate search that must be justified by an exception separate from that for the seizure of his blood, and exigent circumstances did not justify the analysis of his blood once it was drawn. The appellate court recently rejected the same argument in another opinion, as defendant acknowledged in his letter explaining he would not be submit a reply brief. The appellate court also rejected the argument in another decision that the implied consent law was unconstitutional, as it compelled drivers to consent to submitting to a chemical test by threatening loss of driving privileges. It followed that there was no constitutional impediment to sanctioning defendant's refusal by suspending his license. The appellate court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the results of the chemical test of his blood and correctly concluded the implied consent statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a trial court judgment convicting him of 15 counts of theft by fraudulent misrepresentation, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.20(1)(d) (1999-2000). The court affirmed however, stating that the State produced sufficient evidence to establish venue in the county, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.19(2) (1999-2000), as the invoices in question were received in the county. In applying the first part of the multiplicity test, the court concluded that the charges were not identical in fact, because each theft charge against defendant required proof of an additional fact that the other charges did not, namely, the proof of the existence of each individual invoice. Furthermore, the charges were different in fact, as they were separated by time and involved separate volitional acts. Defendant's equal protection challenge failed, as he failed to prove the unconstitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.71 (1999-2000) as applied to him. The court concluded that defendant's counsel was not ineffective, because it was apparent that a motion raising either venue or multiplicity would have been unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>

The victim told police that defendant touched his penis many times before the incident as well. The appellate court found that the trial court admitted evidence to support defendant's theory that the victim's mother fabricated the assault, but excluded evidence relating to the specifics of her own criminal conviction sentencing hearing. The appellate court ruled that this was a reasonable decision, and it would not be disturbed. Also, the trial court did not erroneously exercise its discretion when it summarily denied defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Defendant failed to provide any specific facts to suggest that, but for counsel's advice, the outcome of his trial would have been different. Furthermore, defendant's assertion that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and excessive was moot, due to defendant's death, as any decision regarding the length of sentence would have no practical effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant weight loss club sought a declaration that it was exempt from appellee city taxation under Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.11(4), which, inter alia, exempted from general property taxes property owned and used exclusively by educational or benevolent associations. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) dismissed the complaint, because, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.35(2m), such declaratory-judgment actions were not permitted. The club appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The club paid the taxes &quot;under protest.&quot; The club admitted that it had not followed the procedure mandated by Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.35, even though the assessor's letter denying the requested exemption alerted it that, if it wanted to dispute the determination, it had to follow the procedures set forth in Wis. Stat. 74.35. The appellate court held that the club's contention was that its property was exempted from taxation was not premised on Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 70.11(21)(a) or 70.11(27). Rather, it claimed that it was both an educational and benevolent organization and, therefore, its property was exempt under Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.11(4). Thus, it did not fall under the exceptions to the exclusive procedure mandated by &sect; 74.35(2m), the main aspect of which was set out in Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.35(2). The appellate court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.35(2m) was enacted after Friendship Village was decided, 1997 Wis. Act 237, &sect; 311m, and was, based on uncontroverted legislative-history, enacted with the specific legislative intent to overrule Friendship Village's holding that the denial of tax exemption could have been challenged via a declaratory-judgment action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before defendant was released from incarceration for two sexual assault convictions, the State filed a petition under Wis. Stat. ch. 980 alleging defendant was a sexually violent person. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, found defendant was a sexually violent person and ordered him committed to the department of health and family services. Defendant's motion for post-commitment relief was denied and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that his constitutional rights were violated by the dismissal of the only African-American juror on the jury panel and that his lawyer was deficient for agreeing to the removal of the juror without consulting him. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the decision to have the juror removed as a result of her failure to pay attention during the trial was reasonable. Moreover, defendant was not unfairly prejudiced by the decision to dismiss the inattentive juror. Thus, defendant failed to show that his counsel provided ineffective assistance. Further, defendant was not entitled to a new trial as the real controversy was whether he was a sexually violent person, not whether he was a sexual sadist, as defendant contended. Nor was he entitled to a new trial based on articles he attempted to admit to support his claim that the issue of future risk of dangerousness was not fully tried as the articles were not newly discovered evidence. The State was not required to prove lack of volitional control under Wis. Stat. ch. 980; expert testimony that defendant's disorders created a probability that he would re-offend was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment that found him guilty of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated as a second offense under Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.307 (2002). The arresting officer read an &quot;informing the accused&quot; form to defendant, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(4). Defendant moved to suppress the blood sample and the blood test results. The Circuit Court for Columbia County (Wisconsin) denied the motion, and defendant pled no contest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that evidence obtained from a blood draw taken after his arrest should have been suppressed for two reasons: (1) his consent was involuntary, as the implied consent law unconstitutionally coerced consent; and (2) without consent, a search warrant was needed to analyze his blood sample. The blood sample was analyzed two days after it was drawn. Defendant contended the implied consent law produced coerced &quot;consent,&quot; as it effectively threatened citizens with a penalty, if they did not consent. The appellate court rejected that argument, concluding that any coercion imposed by the implied consent statute was not unreasonable and was thus constitutional. Therefore, defendant's consent was voluntary. Because defendant's consent was voluntary, his assertion that a search warrant was needed to analyze his blood necessarily failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment convicting her of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OMVWI). She claimed the Circuit Court for Columbia County (Wisconsin) erred in denying her motions to suppress evidence of the result of a blood test administered following her arrest. Inter alia, defendant argued that Wisconsin's &quot;implied consent&quot; law was unconstitutional, as it was impermissibly coercive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the allegedly &quot;coercive&quot; implied consent statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(2) (1999-2000), and thus, in her view, VanLaarhoven was not controlling. The appellate court concluded in State v. Wintlend, that the provisions of &sect; 343. 305(2), which conditioned a driver's privilege to operate a motor vehicle on Wisconsin highways on the surrender of his or her right to refuse a chemical test for alcohol concentration did not violate the Fourth Amendment. One who applied for and accepted a license to drive did so on the condition that a failure to submit to the chemical tests would result in the revocation of his license, unless the refusal was reasonable. The appellate court concluded that, to the extent that that condition constituted &quot;coercion,&quot; it was nonetheless not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, given the minimal intrusion at issue balanced against the State's compelling interest in detecting and deterring drunk driving.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the La Crosse County Circuit Court (Wisconsin) which rejected defendant's motion to suppress the admissibility of the results of a chemical test, and convicted defendant of driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant challenged the admissibility of the results of the chemical test performed on her blood. Defendant did not challenge the warrantless seizure of her blood, but argued that the analysis of her blood was a separate search that required a justification under the U.S. Const. amend. IV separate from that for the seizure of her blood, and exigent circumstances did not justify the analysis of her blood once it had been drawn. The appellate court rejected defendant's argument. The court found that the analysis of defendant's blood did not constitute a separate search for constitutional purposes; rather, it was an examination of evidence already seized. Therefore the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the results of the chemical test of her blood.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Outagamie County Circuit Court (Wisconsin) of operating while intoxicated (OWI), third offense. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds. The court of appeals disagreed. Raising the issue of the delay from the dismissal of the first case to the recharging was irrelevant, as, during that period, no trial was pending. Additionally, as the trial court was scheduling motion hearings and briefing, nothing indicated that defendant objected to the expanding timetable. In effect, defendant waived his right to a trial within 60 days of his initial appearance. Defendant could not benefit from a presumption of prejudice, as the delay between his initial appearance and his trial was only 10 months, and the presumption did not arise until 1 year passed. Nothing indicated that the State was more responsible for the delay than defendant, nor was there any indication the State tried to cause a delay so as to hamper the defense. Defendant failed to affirmatively assert his right to a speedy trial. Finally, defendant did not show that he was prejudiced in any way by the delay. Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>
