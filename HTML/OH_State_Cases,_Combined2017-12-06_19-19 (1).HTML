</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant horse training licensee (HTL) sought review of a judgment from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which affirmed an amended order of appellee, the Ohio State Racing Commission (OSRC). The OSRC declared the HTL ineligible to obtain a license from the OSRC for a one-year period, set a reinstatement requirement, imposed a fine, and assessed costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The OSRC issued a training license to the HTL Prior to the expiration thereof, the HTL was found guilty of aggravated theft, in violation of R.C. 2913.02. Accordingly, the OSRC notified the HTL that it intended to suspend or revoke his license pursuant to Ohio Admin. Code 3769-2-26(A)(1). After a hearing, the OSRC adopted a hearing examiner's recommendation for sanctions. However, it rendered him ineligible to obtain a new license rather than a suspension because his license had expired. The trial court affirmed that decision and the HTL sought further review. The court found that the trial court properly determined that the HTL had to show prejudice from the OSRC's failure to issue subpoenas pursuant to R.C. 119.09 in order to obtain a reversal. However, no prejudice was shown because the evidence sought was at most only marginally relevant. The OSRC's imposition of a fine did not constitute double jeopardy, as it was civil in nature. Section 3769-2-26(A)(1) was unconstitutional, as it was a permissible delegation of legislative authority to the OSRC under R.C. 3769.03 because it involved the State's police power in regulating the racing industry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant workers' compensation claimant sued appellee motorist in the Hancock County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for negligence and sought a declaratory judgment that R.C. 4123.931 and 4123.93 were unconstitutional as applied. Appellee Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC) filed a subrogation claim. The trial court denied the claimant's partial summary judgment motion and found R.C. 4123.931 constitutional. The claimant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held R.C. 4123.931 did not offend due process or compensation for takings because its formula, applied to the BWC's subrogation claim, allowed a full and fair hearing. The formula's pro rata distribution ensured subrogation only for sums the BWC paid or would pay. The statute's jury interrogatories, distinguishing between economic and noneconomic loss, were constitutionally adequate, and more interrogatories could be sought as needed to ensure sums not payable as workers' compensation were not recouped. The BWC had no current collectible interest in the claimant's future estimated payments as she could set up a trust account from which to reimburse the BWC for actual future payments. Claimants settling with an alleged tortfeasor were not unconstitutionally distinguished from those who went to trial because both could show their tort recoveries did not duplicate workers' compensation. The claimant's right to a jury trial was not violated because the statutory formula ensured the BWC only recouped what it paid, and no deviation from a jury verdict and interrogatories was allowed when applying it. The interrogatories' use was required when applying the formula.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, upon a guilty plea, of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and was sentenced to six months of incarceration. He was granted judicial release and was placed on three years of community control. Defendant appealed an order entered by the Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) ordering him to submit a DNA sample and a thumbprint as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.07.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the law in effect when he was sentenced did not require him to submit a DNA sample or thumbprint and that the retroactive application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.07 violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The appellate court held that the amended version of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.07 did not expressly provide that the statute was to be applied retroactively and thus did not withstand the first step of the analysis set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.48. The inclusion of such language as &quot;if a person (was) convicted of or (pleaded) guilty to a felony offense and the person (was) on community control&quot; did not provide a clear manifestation of the Ohio legislature's intent that the statute be applied retroactively. Had the legislature intended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.07 apply retroactively, it could have clarified its intention by including specific language to that end. The Steele case was inapplicable as it did not consider whether &sect; 2901.07 could be constitutionally applied retroactively. The trial court erred in retroactively applying &sect; 2901.07. Thus, the statute did not have to be analyzed under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 or the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed. The case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation filed a complaint seeking declaratory judgment and a writ of mandamus, alleging that the zoning ordinance was invalid, rendered its property unfit for use, and constituted an appropriation. The Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted summary judgment for appellee village, as the corporation failed to comply with the statute of limitations under R.C. 2744.04 and R.C. 713.121. The Corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment for the village. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in rendering summary judgment in favor of the village. The trial court correctly concluded that claims regarding procedural irregularities in the zoning ordinance were barred by the corporation's failure to file suit within the two-year statutory period outlined in R.C. 713.121. The mandamus claim was also time barred. Pursuant to the amendment to R.C. 2305.09(E) (2004), the corporation's cause of action in mandamus to compel the village to commence an appropriation action became time-barred on May 31, 2004. Even if the refiled action could properly have been deemed to have related back to the original action, it was time-barred. Although the trial court erroneously applied a two-year statute of limitations, the four-year statute of limitations prescribed in R.C. 2305.09(E) barred the claim. Finally, R.C. 713.121 was constitutional because the right-to-a-remedy provision of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16 applied only to existing, vested rights and state law determined what injuries were recognized and what remedies were available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After sexually propositioning another male university student who was in a restroom stall using the toilet, defendant was convicted in the Cleveland, Ohio, Municipal Court for importuning in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.07(B). Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court should have dismissed the charge, as &sect; 2907.07(B) violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was a first degree misdemeanor with maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $ 1,000 fine under &sect; 2907.07(B), to solicit a person of the same sex to engage in sexual activity with the offender if the offender knew such solicitation was offensive to the other person or was reckless in that regard. Defendant argued that &sect; 2907.07(B)&nbsp;unconstitutionally burdened homosexuals with criminal liability for conduct that was lawful if committed by heterosexuals. The court of appeals found it was not bound by an unreported state supreme court decision that had found no equal protection infirmity in &sect; 2907.07(B).  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11 proscribed the same conduct without regard to the victim's gender, but violating &sect; 2917.11 was a minor misdemeanor with a maximum $ 100 fine. Applying the rational basis test in light of the State's purported interest in protecting the public from offensive conduct likely to provoke physical violence, the court of appeals found no rational basis for burdening homosexuals with greater criminal liability for conduct that would be subject to a lesser punishment if committed by a heterosexual. The importuning statute violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the conviction, vacated the sentence, and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion of the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an employee and his wife, sued defendants, a city and a supervisor, alleging an intentional tort. Defendants jointly filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6) on the grounds that they were both entitled to governmental immunity. The Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted the motion as to the city and denied the motion as to the supervisor. Plaintiffs appealed and the supervisor cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While directing traffic around a department backhoe, which was removing a salt spill from the roadway, the employee was hit by a car and suffered injury as a result. The appellate court held that there was no error in granting the city's motion for dismissal because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.09(C) did not strip the city of immunity. The term &quot;conditions of employment&quot; did not refer to the conditions the employee worked within, and an intentional tort would have occurred outside the scope of employment. Further, as the city was engaged in a governmental function, immunity applied. Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that an exception to immunity applied because they failed to show that the crest of the hill and the equipment affected the regular and ordinary course of traffic, which the law required them to do. Additionally, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2744 did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 34 because that provision was a broad grant of authority to enact laws pertaining to employee rights, not a limitation on its power to enact legislation. The cross-appeal was dismissed for lack of a final, appealable order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant limited liability companies appealed the judgment of the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio) dismissing a complaint filed on behalf of the limited liability companies before the Franklin County Board of Revision (FCBOR), because it was insufficient to invoke the FCBOR's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 50 percent owner of one of the limited liability companies filed a complaint on their behalf with the FCBOR. The FCBOR found in favor of the limited liability companies. The matter was appealed. During the pendency of appeal, a decision invalidated the amended portions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.19, which permitted a formerly unauthorized person to practice law in certain circumstances. As a result, the limited liability companies' complaint was dismissed. For a complaint before the board of revision to be jurisdictionally valid, either an attorney, or an owner-taxpayer acting pro se, had to prepare and file the complaint. The owner was not an attorney, and he did not meet the jurisdictional requirements under former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.13 and former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.19. A limited liability company could not appear in court through an appointed agent not admitted to practice law. Amended Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.19(A)(1)(e), which purported to permit a member of a limited liability company to file a complaint on behalf of the limited liability company, was unconstitutional, because only the judicial branch could make such a determination.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to life in prison and found to be a sexual predator. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the nine-year-old friend of defendant's granddaughter came over to play, defendant engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior with the girls. The police found computer files containing sexually explicit photographic images. At least 47 of the photographic images depicted minor children either in a state of nudity or engaging in sexual conduct and/or sexual activity. The appellate court held that defense counsel was not ineffective. Because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2907.321(A)(5), 2907.322(A)(5), and 2907.323(A)(3) did not prohibit virtual child pornography, only pornography produced by the use of real children, the statutes were not overbroad. Further, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59, that defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to request severance of the counts. As to the sex offense charges, the computer evidence was admissible to show defendant's motive, intent, scheme or plan in committing the sexual abuse against his granddaughter and her friend. That was based upon the fact that the exhibits admitted into evidence clearly established they were gathered and viewed by someone interested in child pornography.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit certified a question of state law to the Ohio Supreme Court as to whether former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5301.24 violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a federal court bankruptcy matter, respondent trustee was allowed to avoid a mortgage in favor of petitioner mortgagee because the mortgage was not properly witnessed, despite former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5301.234, which allowed such mortgages to remain effective. The federal court found that the statute violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D), which required legislative enactments to contain only one subject. The supreme court held a manifestly gross violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D) would cause a legislative enactment to be invalidated, and since the one-subject provision of art. II, &sect; 15(D) was capable of invalidating an enactment, it could not be considered merely directory in nature. Former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5301.234 lacked a common purpose or relationship with the rest of the bill of which it was a part, and there was no discernible reason to combine those provisions into one bill. It was a classic violation of the one-subject rule in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D). It was inappropriate for the court to inquire into extrinsic evidence of whether the statute's enactment was actually the result of logrolling, or whether the statute involved controversial legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified question was answered in the affirmative, and it was held that the statute's inclusion in a particular bill violated the one-subject rule, so the statute was severed from the remainder of the bill and nonoffending provisions in the act adopting the bill were saved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother appealed a judgment of the Seneca County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) granting the motion for summary judgment filed by defendants, village, village recreation board, and lifeguard in the mother's wrongful death action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 15-year-old swimmer drowned at the village's public swimming area. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by granting defendants' summary judgment based on immunity under R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) because the village and its recreation board were political subdivisions and were engaged in the governmental function of maintenance and operation of the recreational swimming area and the exception to immunity under R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) did not apply. The mother failed to demonstrate that there was a physical defect on the premises because: (1) even though the village did not post signs warning of the presence of deep water, deep water in public swimming areas was a common and expected feature, especially as the swimming area had diving boards and slides; (2) the mother's expert, who stated that there were copious amounts of vegetation, inspected the area almost three years after the swimmer's death; and (3) during her deposition, the expert stated there was not a significant drop off in the area where the swimmer drowned. The mother also failed to show that the swimmer's death was due to the alleged physical defects.</SPAN></P>

Appellant estate sued, on behalf of decedent, claiming appellee city had failed to provide proper warning devices. The court affirmed summary judgment in appellee city's favor. The Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.01 et seq., was not unconstitutional because the legislature could have enacted statutes to limit liability against a political subdivision that were rationally related to preserving their fiscal resources. The statute barred claims based on failure to erect warning devices or additional center lane line extensions as these were discretionary decisions; there was no claim of disrepair.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his plea was not knowing and voluntary under Crim. R. 11. The court of appeals disagreed. At defendant's plea hearing, defendant's counsel indicated to the trial court that he had informed his client of the maximum 28 year penalty. However, the trial court clearly indicated that the rape charges carried a maximum prison term of 40 years and the felonious assault charge carried a maximum penalty of eight years. The trial court reiterated that the combined total maximum penalty that defendant was facing was 48 years. Defendant indicated that he understood. Further, the plea form that defendant signed clearly provided the possible maximum sentence. Although the trial court did improperly indicate a mandatory four-year rather than a five-year period of postrelease control, defendant failed to demonstrate a prejudicial effect of the misstatements; thus, his plea was not rendered invalid.</SPAN></P>

There was no evidence they knew or were aware of any great probability of harm. Trial court was correct in granting summary judgment to defendant employees. The acts or omissions were not discretionary under &sect; 2744.03(A)(5), thus, defendant board was not immune.

The insurer appealed, and the Court of Appeals certified a conflict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was denied uninsured motorist coverage for injuries received when riding in a vehicle driven by her spouse under a provision that &quot;uninsured motor vehicle&quot; did not include a vehicle owned by an insured or a family member, tracking former R.C. 3937.18(K)(2). The supreme court held the appellate court's conclusion that former R.C. 3937.18(K)(2) created a classification based on household status was fundamentally flawed. The statute's focus was on &quot;the tortfeasor,&quot; and it did not bar coverage based on the insured's relationship to the tortfeasor. It focused on the vehicle the tortfeasor drove at the time of the accident and allowed a denial of coverage if the tortfeasor drove a vehicle owned by, furnished to, or available for the use of a named insured, regardless of the relationship of the party seeking coverage to the tortfeasor. There was no classification so there could not be an equal protection violation. Former R.C. 3937.18(J)(1) and former R.C. 3937.18(K)(2) did not conflict, as they addressed different topics and could function alternatively or together, so &sect; 3937.18(J)(1) played no role in an equal protection inquiry regarding &sect; 3937.18(K)(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a judgment of the Union County Common Pleas Court, Ohio, which denied, inter alia, his petition for sexual offender reclassification.  The inmate asserted three assignments of error including the claim that under R.C. 158, he should have been allowed to seek reclassification of his sexual offender status under the version of R.C. 2950.09(D) as it existed when the inmate was initially sentenced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was classified as a sexual predator when he was originally sentenced on multiple counts of pandering obscenity and sexually oriented matter involving a minor. The classification was restated after an appeal resulted in a resentencing. The inmate asserted three assignments of error. The claim that the Walsh Act, R.C. 2950.31, which required the Attorney General to reclassify previously classified sexual offenders under a new three-tiered system, was unconstitutional was premature. The issue of whether the trial court violated the inmate's due process rights by failing to hold a sexual predator classification hearing when the inmate was originally sentenced was barred. The issue could have been raised in his direct appeal. The appellate court agreed with decisions by the Fifth and Eighth Appellate Districts that the version of R.C. 2950.09(D) in effect when the inmate filed his petition for reclassification applied. As the amended version of R.C. 2950.09(D) went into effect on July 31, 2003, it applied to the inmate's 2007 petition for reclassification. Reclassification was prohibited under amended R.C. 2950.09(D).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a water and sewer district, challenged a decision from the Licking County Court of Common Pleas, Ohio, which granted a directed verdict and dismissed the district's complaint against appellees, a city and a school board, in a dispute over what entity was permitted to provide water and sanitary sewer services to a parcel of property. The board filed a cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district filed a complaint against the board and the city seeking a declaration that it had the exclusive right to provide water and sanitary sewer services to the location at issue. The trial court granted a directed verdict made by the city and dismissed the district's complaint. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the balancing test stated in City of Columbus v. Teater was the proper state law basis for resolving the dispute. The outcome of the constitutional argument depended upon the facts and circumstances of the case. Ohio Const. art. XVIII did not confer absolute authority on a municipality to construct and maintain a water supply system within its borders. While the district had the pipes in the ground, the Ohio General Assembly did not see fit to protect rural water associations from encroachment of its service area by annexation; further, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency permitted the board to install connection lines to the city, the district's request to lock-in this service area had been denied, and a quality management plan indicated that the board could have obtained sewer services from either the district or the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was affirmed. The cross-appeal was rendered moot.</SPAN></P>

The Equal Protection Clause was not violated simply because defendant was convicted and sentenced under the statute carrying the greater penalty; [3]-The felony murder statute adequately provided notice to defendant of the elements of the crime charged and was neither overbroad nor void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's hand was amputated on the job. An intentional tort action was filed, and judgment was entered for the employer. The appellate court reversed, and the case was ultimately remanded by the Ohio Supreme Court. In affirming the trial court, the appellate court held that R.C. 2745.01 was not an affirmative defense. Therefore, no waiver resulted from the employer's failure to assert R.<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#266;</SPAN> 2745.01 in its answer. Next, the appellate court rejected the employee's argument that R.C. 2745.01's substantial certainty requirement was less stringent than the substantial certainty requirement articulated in Fyffe v. Jeno's Inc. Even though the trial court analyzed the case under the standards in Fyffe, there was no error in granting summary judgment in favor of the employer. The facts of the case did not implicate R.C. 2745.01(C), (D). There was nothing in the record indicating that the employer committed a tortious act with the specific intent to injure the employee or that the employer acted with a deliberate intent to cause the employee to suffer an injury for purposes of R.C. 2745.01(A), (B). The injury was a result of a miscommunication and constituted an unfortunate accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A lawsuit was filed in 2005 after it was discovered that footers for residences were not placed at the proper depth under a city's building code. The trial court determined that the statute of repose in R.C. 2305.131 did not apply. A judgment was entered for the association, and this appeal followed. In reversing, the appellate court determined that an &quot;improvement&quot; included everything that permanently enhanced the value of the premises for general uses. By its very nature, the construction of a building, including the installation of the foundation and footers, was an &quot;improvement to real property&quot; as it was a permanent structure intended to add value to the real estate via a new use as a residence or business. The footers were an integral part of the foundation for the condominiums, they were permanent in nature, they were meant to be an integral part of the land, and they enhanced the value and use of the property. R.C. 2305.131 began to run upon the completion of services and construction, which in this case was in 1990 when occupancy permits were issued. Finally, a constitutionality issue was not addressed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicted defendant of multiple counts of rape, gross sexual imposition (GSI), and kidnapping. His sentence was reversed. On remand, he received consecutive life terms in prison on two of the rape counts, 10 years on the other two rape counts, eight years on each kidnapping count, five years on four of the GSI counts, and 18 months on the other counts of GSI. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it failed to merge the kidnapping and rape counts as allied offenses. The appellate court held that, as the State conceded, the trial court did err by failing to merge the kidnapping and rape counts as allied offenses. However, imposition of consecutive terms of imprisonment, rather than concurrent terms, was not contrary to law. Defendant faced the same range of potential prison sentences on the date that he committed the offenses as he did on the day that he was sentenced. Ex post facto claims relative to the application of Foster had already been addressed and rejected. Foster did not judicially increase the range of defendant's sentence, nor did it retroactively apply a new statutory maximum to an earlier committed crime, or create the possibility of consecutive sentences where none existed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the trial court judgment which failed to merge the kidnapping and rape counts as allied offenses was reversed and the case was remanded for merger of the allied offenses and modification of the sentence. The sentencing judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a county recorder and three registered voters, sued defendant county and others, claiming that the county recorder and other elected county officials were being unconstitutionally removed from office before the end of their terms. The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. Only one of the voters appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that public officers have no vested property interest right in the office. Ohio law does not recognize an elector's right to have an elected officer complete his or her term in the office. The county charter could have provided a remedy for the officeholders whose terms were abolished in mid-term, but the drafters chose not to and the court could not provide redress. The county charter provisions at issue were not expressly made retroactive. The abolition of the existing offices were not based on a prior election. The voter did not have a right cognizable by law, constitutional or otherwise, to demand that public officeholders complete their elected terms. Because the voter had not alleged a personal stake in the outcome of the instant controversy, or demonstrated that he had or would suffer a specific injury that was redressible by the court, he did not have the requisite standing to pursue this appeal. The trial court properly denied the recorder's request to have counsel appointed at public expense. No public purpose was furthered by expending public funds to help the recorder remain in the abolished office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's rape conviction subjected him to the notification requirement under Ohio's sex offender registration and notification law (SORN). He later pled no contest to violating that requirement and was convicted. The conviction was reversed on appeal. On remand, the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) found him guilty of violating R.C. 2950.05(A) by not giving notice of his address change. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to present evidence that was critical to establishing the impossibility defense. The appellate court held that had any of the suggested evidence been presented, the trial court's verdict would have been the same. To establish the affirmative defense of impossibility, defendant needed to notify the sheriff of the change in his residence address on the first business day after he learned of the change. As the trial court found, defendant never notified the sheriff. Therefore, defendant could not establish the impossibility defense. Further, defendant did not contend that the evidence failed to support an essential element of the failure-to-notify offense. His contention that the evidence proved that it was impossible for him to notify the sheriff of his intent to move was irrelevant as to whether the State presented enough evidence to support the conviction for failure to notify. However, rather than sentencing him under current law, the trial court should have sentenced him under Megan's Law, the law that was in effect in 2006, when he committed the underlying offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed. However, his sentence was vacated and the cause was remanded so that he could be resentenced under former law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of multiple murder counts and related offenses. He was sentenced to death, which was affirmed on appeal. A petition for postconviction relief was dismissed. The dismissal was affirmed. A motion for reconsideration and then a motion to reopen his direct appeal were denied. He again filed for postconviction relief, which was denied by judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his second petition, Defendant set forth 43 claims for relief. The appellate court found he was properly denied appointed counsel for his second petition because the appointment was requested after the petition was filed, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21(I) spoke to a person who intended to file a petition. It was unnecessary to appoint counsel to accomplish a task already completed. The trial court also determined there were no substantive grounds for relief, and dismissed the petition without a hearing. At that point, any potential need for the appointment of counsel at the trial court level was obviated. Without reaching the question of whether the appointment of counsel in a second petition for postconviction relief was required, the appellate court found there was no error in declining to appoint counsel in the instant action. The dismissal of the petition, without a hearing, was also proper. There was no requirement for states to provide postconviction relief, and, therefore, Ohio was allowed to impose procedural requirements before a postconviction hearing would be required. The appellate court found Ohio's requirements were reasonable, proper, and constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated murder and was sentenced to death. Appellant obtained federal habeas corpus relief, obliging the trial court to resentence him. The trial court held that it could not retroactively apply R.C. 2929.06(B) in resentencing appellant, and therefore, appellant was ineligible for a death sentence. The Court of Appeals for Ashland County (Ohio) reversed and remanded. Appellant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the trial court should have applied R.C. 2929.06(B) on resentencing, thereby allowing the death penalty to once again be available on remand. The state supreme court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals. R.C. 2929.06(B) applied where an aggravated-murder conviction with a death specification had been affirmed, but the death sentence had been set aside for legal error, when the error infected and thus invalidated the sentencing phase of the trial. In such a case, R.C. 2929.06(B) permitted empanelment of a new jury to resentence the offender. The state supreme court held that application of R.C. 2929.06(B) to appellant's resentencing would not increase appellant's potential sentence, impair any of appellant's vested or accrued rights, violate any reliance interest or any reasonable expectation of finality, or impose any new burdens on him. R.C. 2929.06(B) was remedial, not substantive. Hence, the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution, Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, did not bar its retroactive application in cases where the aggravated murder was committed before its enactment, but the death sentence was set aside after its enactment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that because he had completed the sentence for the sexually oriented offense and was serving a sentence for crimes committed in another county, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to conduct the hearing. While the trial court retained jurisdiction to hold a sexual predator classification hearing and properly adjudicated appellant a sexual predator, appellant could not be required, upon release, to register as a sexual predator. The duty to register, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2950.04(A)(1), 2950.03(A)(1), was only imposed upon a sexual predator who was, on or after July 1, 1997, serving a term of incarceration for a sexually oriented offense. Appellant's term for gross sexual imposition (GSI) expired in 1994 and, at the time of his adjudication, appellant was serving time for offenses that were not sexually oriented. Since appellant was sentenced prior to July 1, 1997, he did not fit under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.04(A)(2), nor did he fit under &sect; 2950.04(A)(3) because he was never adjudicated a habitual-sexual offender and was not required to register under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court adjudicating appellant a sexual predator and ordering him to register was reversed, and the case was remanded with instructions to the trial court to vacate its entry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Common Pleas of Perry County, No. 22043.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In DeRolph v. State (1997), 78 Ohio St. 3d 193, 677 N.E.2d 733 (&quot;DeRolph I&quot;), at the syllabus, this court determined that &quot;Ohio's elementary and secondary public school financing system violates Section 2, Article VI of the Ohio Constitution, which mandates a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state.&quot; For the background and procedural history of the events that led up to that opinion, see 78 Ohio St. 3d at 193-195, 677 N.E.2d at 734-735.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In DeRolph I, this court recognized that a new funding system could not be crafted and implemented without time and deliberation. Therefore, we stayed the effect of our decision for twelve months, id. at 213, 677 N.E.2d at 747, in order to give the General Assembly time to enact remedial legislation. We remanded the cause to the trial court, ordering the trial court to &quot;retain jurisdiction until the legislation is enacted and in effect, taking such action as may be necessary to ensure conformity with this opinion.&quot; Id.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In entries issued after that decision, this court expounded on its order of remand to the trial court. In particular, in response to a request from the defendants for clarification and reconsideration of the decision, this court stated that local property taxes could be part of the revised funding plan, but property taxes could not be the primary means of funding a thorough and efficient system of schools.  78 Ohio St. 3d 419, 678 N.E.2d 886, 887. Furthermore, this court stated that, consistent with the DeRolph I decision, upon remand to the trial court the parties could present evidence regarding the enacted remedy, to establish whether the remedy satisfied the Thorough and Efficient Clause of the Ohio Constitution. 78 Ohio St. 3d at 420-421, 678 N.E.2d at 887-888. The parties could then appeal the trial court's ruling directly to this court, for final determination.  Id. at 421, 678 Ohio St. 3d at 888.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From August 24, 1998, through September 3, 1998, the trial court held a hearing on the General Assembly's efforts in the wake of DeRolph I to create a new funding method. Plaintiffs, who continued to assert that Ohio's system of funding public education is unconstitutional, are essentially the same plaintiffs who pressed that position in DeRolph I. The defendants argued that the revised system complies with the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the hearing, the trial court propounded inquiries to this court. This court responded by stating that (1) the remand to the trial court involved the Thorough and Efficient Clause of the Ohio Constitution and did not involve the Equal Protection Clause, and (2) the state bore the burden of production and proof on remand, and was required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the Constitution had been satisfied in order to prevail.  83 Ohio St. 3d 1212, 699 N.E.2d 518, 518-519.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After extensive briefing and the presentation of a great deal of evidence, the trial court issued its decision on February 26, 1999. The decision, reported at (1999), 98 Ohio Misc. 2d 1, 712 N.E.2d 125, is two hundred sixty-three pages in length in the Ohio Official Reports. Upon determining that the state had failed to implement a complete systematic overhaul of Ohio's school-funding system, the trial court concluded that the state had failed to meet its burden of proof that it had complied with the requirements of the Ohio Constitution. 98 Ohio Misc. 2d at 263, 712 N.E.2d at 297.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the defendants' appeal as of right from the trial court decision, under the procedures established in DeRolph I and subsequent orders of this court.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Perry County that the Ohio General Assembly's recent reworking of the laws governing Ohio's public school financing system still left the State with an unconstitutional public school financing scheme.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with the trial court's determination that the Ohio General Assembly (legislature) had failed to show that it had systematically overhauled Ohio's school funding system to pass constitutional muster. Specifically, it found fault with the methods used to measure the equity of district funding, because the legislature had departed from its expert consultant's measuring standards without explanation for its departure. Local property taxes still accounted for the majority of school funding, contrary to court mandate. The measures passed for construction of new facilities and maintenance of existing facilities was inadequate to correct the existing $ 16.5 billion deficit, and made no account for forthcoming maintenance needs. The legislature passed academic standards accountability statutes without passing the necessary appropriations bills to sustain them, in effect worsening the schools' financial positions. Voters did not approve a one-cent sales tax increase passed to increase funding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court affirmed trial court's judgment and extended time for State of Ohio General Assembly (legislature) to enact legislation to bring public school financing system within constitutional compliance, because court was unwilling to completely reject legislature's progress and because process was complex and required balancing of many factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, four Ohio bars and their proprietors, sought review of a judgment from the Franklin County Municipal Court, Environmental Division (Ohio), which granted summary judgment to appellee city in appellants' action challenging the constitutionality of the &quot;City of Columbus Smoke-free Indoor Air Act of 2004,&quot; enacted as Columbus, Ohio, City Code &sect; 715.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional and an injunction against the Act's enforcement by the city. The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment. It found that there was no conflict with state law, no violation of appellants' substantive due process or equal protection rights, and that the Act was not vague as to its definition of proscribed conduct. On appeal, the court found no conflict with R.C. &sect; 3791.031 where that provision and the Act regulated the issue of smoking in public places differently, and each addressed different public spaces and different conduct. Accordingly, there was no violation of Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. The Act set out an objective standard that set forth the proscribed conduct in ordinary language, and use of the phrase &quot;permit smoking&quot; was commonly understood, such that the Act was not vague. There was no substantive due process or equal protection violation by the Act, as it passed the rational basis test because the city had a legitimate governmental interest in protecting the health of its citizens, and distinctions between private and public clubs were not arbitrary or invidious.</SPAN></P>

The Portage County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) sentenced him to five years on each count, to be served consecutively, for a total of 25 years in prison, plus five years of post-release control. He was also adjudicated a Tier III sexual offender. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it imposed the maximum sentence because it did not comply with the statutory factors. The appellate court held that the trial court had no obligation to make findings of fact or reference any statutory presumption while determining the aggregate length of the prison term. Further, the trial court's sentencing determination was not contrary to the law because the sentences were within the ranges under R.C. 2929.14(A)(3). Also, the imposition of an aggregate term of 25 years was consistent with both reason and the trial record, and did not demonstrate any arbitrary or unconscionable attitude on the part of the trial court. Defendant pled guilty to five offenses showing a specific pattern of behavior on his part. He admitted that he engaged in sexual contact with the victim on multiple occasions over a six-year period. The facts also established that the sexual contact began when the victim was only seven years old, that defendant's conduct was facilitated by his relationship with the victim as her step-grandfather, and that the victim suffered significant psychological harm as a result of his conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which classified him as a sexual predator pursuant to R.C. 2950.09.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court improperly relied on an inarticulable recollection of assumedly aggravating circumstances in determining that he was a sexual predator. In addition, he argued that because he could never have the classification removed, R.C. 2950.09 was ex post facto and retroactive legislation. The appellate court concluded that the basis for the trial court's decision was clear on the record. The trial court specifically mentioned the statutory factors upon which it relied in determining the likelihood of defendant's recidivism. The trial court also commented on the fact that defendant's case was unusual, because, at the sentencing hearing, the trial court deemed it necessary to impose consecutive terms for each sexual offense conviction contained in a single indictment. This was more of a remark than a basis for the trial court's decision. The trial court had information that indicated defendant, a repeat sexual offender, met the criteria for a diagnosis of pedophilia. In addition, the appellate court had previously addressed and rejected defendant's argument that R.C. 2950.09 was unconstitutional as retroactive and ex post facto punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county department of job and family services revoked appellant home day-care provider's Type B certification. The provider filed a notice of administrative appeal. The department moved to dismiss the appeal. The Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the provider missed the deadline to appeal the revocation under Ohio Admin. Code 5101:2-14-40. The provider appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The day-care provider argued that, pursuant to R.C. 119.07, she should have been allowed 30 days in which to file her administrative appeal of the department's decision to revoke her home day-care license. The appellate court held that, pursuant to R.C. 119.06, the department was required to provide the day-care provider an opportunity for a hearing in connection with its decision to revoke her home day-care license. Pursuant to former R.C. 119.07, the provider was entitled to a hearing on the decision to revoke her license as long as she requested it within 30 days of the date that notice of that decision was mailed to her. Further, Ohio Admin. Code 5101:2-14-40, which allowed only 10 days in which to file a county appeal review, clearly subtracted from, and therefore conflicted with, former R.C. 119.07, which granted a 30-day deadline for the same activity. Given the conflict, Ohio Admin. Code 5101:2-14-40 was invalid. Thus, pursuant to former R.C. 119.07, the provider should have been afforded 30 days in which to file her appeal with the agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based upon alleged criminal activity involving a female under 10 years old which occurred over a three-year period, appellant was indicted on 20 counts of rape by force or threat of force, and 20 counts of gross sexual imposition. On the trial date, appellant agreed to withdraw his pleas of not guilty in exchange for the dismissal of several counts in the indictment. The trial judge then accepted appellant's guilty pleas. Prior to sentencing, appellant asked the judge to withdraw his plea. The judge denied the motion, sentenced appellant, and determined appellant to be a sexual predator. Judgment affirmed. Trial judge properly denied appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, as the motion was based upon nothing more than a change of heart. Based upon appellant's age, the victim's age, the period of time during which appellant committed the offenses, the nature and pattern of the sexual contact, and the threat to kill the victim's father, the court concluded affirmed the sexual predator determination. There was no unfairness in holding the sexual predator hearing at sentencing rather than prior to appellant's release from prison.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sign company sued appellee city in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) (1) to declare it was entitled to a sign permit and applied for a sign outside the right-of-way; (2) mandamus requiring the city to prove the sign was installed on property zoned for billboards; (3) damages; and (4) an injunction restraining a stop work order's enforcement. The trial court granted the city summary judgment, and the company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company had unsuccessfully appealed the city's board of zoning appeals' (BZA) decision upholding a stop work order barring the company from building an approved sign. The appellate court held res judicata barred the company's declaratory judgment claim that its sign was not in a right-of-way because the BZA's ruling and its upholding were a judicial proceeding on the merits of whether the sign was in the right-of-way. Res judicata did not bar constitutional claims or a claim that the company was entitled to a permit based on its last submitted application was outside the scope of the first trial court judgment. The city was entitled to sovereign immunity as to the company's claim for damages because the city was engaged in a governmental function when it denied the company's applications, but this did not apply to the company's claims for equitable relief. The company's equal protection violation claim was not supported because it did not show it was treated differently from a similarly situated entity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed as to the dismissal of the company's claim that its proposed sign did not encroach on a right of way, and as to the company's damages and equal protection claims, but it was otherwise reversed, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings on the company's declaratory judgment and mandamus claims on whether it was entitled to a permit based on its final application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) to one count of rape. The trial court imposed a sentence of imprisonment, which was ordered to run concurrently to a previously imposed sentence of imprisonment for kidnapping, and classified defendant as a Tier III sex offender under R.C. 2950.01. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his sentence as well as his sexual offender classification, registration and community notification requirements. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's challenges to S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007 and 2008), because it was not an impermissibly retroactive and ex post facto scheme that exposed offenders to double jeopardy and imposed cruel and unusual punishment. Further, because there was no prior judicial classification in effect, defendant's classification was not governed by Bodyke. Furthermore, sex offender classification was a creation of the Ohio Legislature, and therefore, the power to classify was properly expanded or limited by the Legislature. Moreover, pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, which included a joint recommendation for a concurrent sentence, the parties agreed that defendant's sentence on the rape charge would not merge under R.C. 2941.25(A) with his prior sentence on a kidnapping offense. Finally, defendant failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel because defendant did not demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would have received a more favorable outcome or sentence if his counsel had objected to the agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator property owners were granted a writ of mandamus compelling respondents city, mayor, city council, and planning commission to commence appropriation proceedings to determine the amount of the city's temporary taking of the property owners' land. The city, mayor, city council, and planning commission moved for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A case cited by the city, mayor, city council, and planning commission was inapplicable because it involved a direct action for money damages against a municipality and was based upon the doctrine of sovereign immunity. By contrast, the instant case involved a mandamus claim to compel public authorities to institute appropriation proceedings where an involuntary taking of property was proven. The city, mayor, city council, and planning commission had asserted the applicability of another case in their merit brief. This attempt to reargue was not authorized under Ohio Sup. Ct. Prac. R. XI(2)(A). In any event, the second case was also inapplicable. The court ruled that restricting the property owners' land to residential use on property that was held to be unsuitable for residential use had an obvious adverse economic impact on the property owners. Further, the city's application of residential classifications to the property did not substantially advance any legitimate concern of the city. However, the court did change its holding regarding when the taking was deemed to have occurred, and ruled that date was to be when the property owners refiled their declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion for reconsideration was granted in part, and the period of the temporary taking was shortened. In all other respects, the motion was denied.</SPAN></P>

Chapter 3316 was unconstitutional. The matter arose when the employees' contracts were suspended as part of a reduction in force.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to a determination by a State Auditor that a city school district was in a state of fiscal emergency pursuant to R.C. 3316.03, a commission was appointed. The commission directed the district board of education to suspend employment contracts through a reduction in force, which suspensions included the support staff employees. Appellants filed suit, alleging that R.C. Chapter 3316 violated the Equal Protection Clause of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2, and that it violated Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect; 3. The trial court granted motions under Civ. R. 12(B)(1) and (6) to dismiss by the commission, the superintendent, and the Auditor. Appellants dismissed their claims against the board. On appeal, the court noted that the trial court applied the proper standard in deciding the dismissal motions. It held that the trial court properly applied the rational basis test in determining the equal protection claim, as the fundamental right to vote was not implicated. The State had a legitimate interest in protecting the financial stability of the district pursuant to R.C. 3316.02. There was no violation of Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect; 3, as electors could vote on the number and organization of the board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges filed against defendant for aggravated murder with a firearm specification and tampering arose from the shooting death of his wife. Defendant pled guilty to murder and the firearm specification, and no contest to the tampering count pursuant to a plea agreement. The trial court found defendant guilty of the tampering count. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in not entering specific findings on the sentence imposed on the tampering conviction. The appellate court disagreed, because trial court judges were not obligated to engage in judicial fact-finding prior to imposing consecutive sentences. Also, there was no error as a matter of law in the trial court sentencing defendant to the maximum, consecutive sentences nor any abuse of discretion. The allocution of facts supported a separate animus for the crime of tampering with evidence, and there was potential harm if the State was forced to bring the matter as an aggravated murder charge because of the blackout defense asserted by defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the landfill filed its declaratory judgment action, the neighbor, who owned property adjoining the landfill, was not joined as a party. A consent judgment was entered in the case. The consent judgment, among other things, declared certain zoning regulations invalid as they applied to the landfill and required a zoning inspector to issue a zoning certificate for expansion of the landfill. The neighbor filed the motion to intervene and motion to vacate the consent decree, but the motions were denied, as the case was no longer pending due to the consent judgment. An initial appeal was dismissed for lack of standing. On return to the trial court, consideration was given to the neighbor's motions. The trial court, based on a denial of the neighbor's motion to intervene in a related case, denied the neighbor's motion to intervene and Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(B) motion. The ruling in the related case was appealed. The appellate court reversed the ruling in the related case. Thus, the basis for the ruling denying intervention in the instant case had been reversed on appeal. As a result, the trial court was required to consider the merits of the neighbor's motion to intervene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments were reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for a determination of the neighbor's motion to intervene, and, if granted, the neighbor's motion for relief from judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The mother successfully completed her case plan, and her child was returned to her care and the TC in the agency was terminated. Thereafter, the mother reverted to her bad habits and a new matter was commenced. The father failed to appear at all, and the mother stipulated to allegations of dependency. The child was removed and TC was again granted to the agency. Thereafter, the juvenile court granted permanent custody of the child to the agency. On appeal, the court found that the father was properly served with notices of the hearings. There was no unconstitutionality in R.C. &sect; 2151.413(D)(1), although no specific finding of unfitness was required where the child was in the temporary custody of the agency for 12 or more months out of a consecutive 22-month period under R.C. &sect; 2151.414(B)(1)(d), as there was an implicit finding of unsuitability in various other findings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of pandering obscenity involving a minor, pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor, endangering children, and illegal use of a minor in nudity oriented material or performance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a relationship with a 16-year-old female victim. Multiple nude images of her, as well as a sexual video, were found on an image storing device that belonged to defendant, and were seen on his laptop computer. He was indicted for multiple sexual offenses, and convicted after a jury trial. The trial court imposed a term of imprisonment on him. On appeal, the court found that denial of defendant's dismissal motion was proper with respect to two counts under R.C. 2907.323(A)(1) and (3), as the indictment was sufficient for those offenses pursuant to Crim. R. 7(B). The judicial construction placed on the element &quot;state of nudity&quot; was not a separate element of the offense, but instead, merely defined that element. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's pandering conviction under R.C. 2907.322(A)(1), as he admitted to downloading the video of the victim onto a flash card. Such action was sufficient for the jury to reasonably conclude that defendant had &quot;reproduced&quot; the video. Accordingly, denial of his acquittal motion under Crim. R. 29 was proper.</SPAN></P>

The sentences were within the statutory sentencing range. Furthermore, the record reflected that the trial court considered the purposes and principles of sentencing and the seriousness and recidivism factors as required in R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12 and advised defendant regarding post release control. Finally, the imposition of consecutive sentences was not an abuse of discretion given the circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The CAT was imposed for the privilege of doing business in Ohio, R.C. 5751.02(A); pursuant to R.C. 5751.03(A), the tax was based on gross receipts. The grocers alleged that to the degree that gross receipts included proceeds from the sale of food, the CAT was an unconstitutional tax on the sale of food. The high court disagreed. While Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect;&sect; 3(C) and 13 prohibited a sales tax on food, they did not prohibit the State from using gross receipts to compute the amount of a privilege-of-doing-business tax, even if those gross receipts included proceeds from the sale of food. A franchise tax could be measured by tax-exempt income or property and still be a valid tax on the franchise and not on the property. The CAT was what it purported to be: a permissible tax on the privilege of doing business, not a proscribed tax upon the sale or purchase of food.</SPAN></P>

At approximately 10:21 p.m., 911 dispatchers received a call from defendant, who told the dispatchers that the son had fallen down a stairway, and had stopped breathing. The son was rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Defendant filed a motion to suppress oral statements made to police officers and motions to dismiss both counts of the indictment charging defendant with felony murder because of various alleged constitutional infirmities, which the trial court denied. After his conviction, the appellate court found that neither Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.02(B) nor defendant's conviction for felony murder where the predicate offense was not independent of the conduct that killed the son were in violation of equal protection or due process guarantees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City argued that Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;1.63 was not a general law. The appellate court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.63 provided the State with sole authority to regulate the business of originating, granting, servicing, and collecting loans and preempted municipal ordinances that attempted to regulate the same. Section 1.63 did not prescribe a rule of conduct upon citizens generally and was not a general law. As &sect; 1.63 was not a general law and the State's attempt to extinguish the legislative power of a municipal corporation under &sect; 1.63 was unconstitutional, the appellate court did not consider whether the City ordinances were in conflict with it. The City ordinances did not permit what state statutes expressly prohibited or vice versa. The state statutes set a minimum requirement and did not expressly permit or prohibit loans for a lower threshold. They also did not expressly limit any of the additional requirements imposed by the City. There was no constitutional basis for applying implied preemption. The enactment of the City ordinances with more stringent regulations was a proper exercise of the City's home rule powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Lorain County (Ohio) that convicted defendant of six counts of sexual battery and one count of corruption of another with drugs, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2907.03(A)(7) and 2925.02(A), respectively. Defendant was sentenced to 10 years in prison. On appeal, defendant argued 13 assignments of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a high school teacher who was accused of engaging in sexual relationships with two students, and, in one case, supplying one with marijuana. On appeal, the appellate court found that defendant waived his right to appeal on the allegation that his conviction was beyond the statute of limitations. Further, there was ample evidence in the record to support defendant's sexual battery convictions based on the testimony of the two victims, the first victim's diary, and other evidence. Moreover, defense counsel's performance was not deficient, and the appellate court found that defendant suffered no prejudice from counsel's failure to file a motion to suppress. As to the make up of the jury, the jurors who admitted reading or listening to pre-trial publicity also indicated that they could still fairly decide the case based only on the evidence presented at trial. As to defendant's Batson challenge, the panel still contained one African-American juror, though the State could have exercised its additional peremptory challenges against that juror. However, the trial court did not make explicit findings to justify the imposition of consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded as to defendant's sentence, and affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held the general assembly stated an intent to preempt municipal regulation and occupy the field of predatory lending as an issue of statewide concern. Sub. H.B. 386 was a general law, for purposes of a home-rule analysis, because (1) only the state could regulate mortgage lending, so Sub. H.B. 386 was part of comprehensive statewide legislative regulation, and statewide dominance was required, (2) the statute applied uniformly to all parts of the state, (3) the statute involved the use of police power, and (4) the statute prescribed a rule of conduct upon citizens generally. The city's regulations conflicted with the state's statutes because they sought to prohibit conduct the state had authorized. The city impermissibly regulated the making of a loan authorized by the general assembly. R.C. &sect; 1.63, as part of Sub. H.B. 386, Gen. Assem.

The witness became confused on the stand and stated that her written statement might refresh her recollection. She returned the statement to the prosecutor before continuing with her testimony. Defendant's felonious assault conviction under R.C. 2903.11(A)(2) was not against the manifest weight of the evidence and was therefore supported by sufficient evidence as defendant was aware for R.C. 2901.22(B) purposes that shooting a gun at the two victims would probably cause physical harm. Further, defendant threatened the witness if she told anyone of the shooting. Defendant's consecutive sentences were proper. The amendment to former R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), renumbered R.C. 2929.14(C)(4), requiring fact finding for consecutive sentences did not apply to defendant as the amendment was not effective until after defendant was sentenced.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a bench trial in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) of one count of failure to register, a violation of R.C. 2950.041. The trial court sentenced defendant to the statutory minimum term of imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was originally classified as a sex offender under Florida law, failed to notify a county sheriff's department of his change of address. He argued that the penalty in force in Ohio when he was convicted and classified in Florida as a sexual offender in 2006 had to be applied to his 2010 violation of notification requirements. On appeal, the court found that it appeared that defendant could have been classified as a sexual predator under Ohio's version of Megan's law. However, even if he were classified as a sexually oriented offender, under both Ohio and Florida law he was required to comply with registration and notification provisions. His violation, and a prior violation, were within the compliance period. Due to the definition of defendant's original crime, his violation was changed from a third degree felony to a first degree felony by S.B. 97, Gen. Assem. (Ohio). Thus, the penalty codified at R.C. 2950.99(A)(1)(a)(ii) (2008), for violation of the reporting requirements was not to be applied. Instead, remand for resentencing as a third degree felony, the penalty that was in place when defendant was originally classified as a sexual predator, was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed in part as to defendant's conviction. The sentence was reversed and the matter was remanded to the trial court for resentencing and for clarification of the appropriate sex offender classification for defendant under Ohio's version of Megan's Law.</SPAN></P>

The city cashed both checks. Before any drilling commenced, the city passed a resolution rescinding the prior resolution due to concerns that the wells might have caused safety and health issues. The trial court revived the lease and held that the energy company could invoke its right of arbitration under the lease. The city maintained that the second resolution did not impair the lease and that the energy company waived its contractual right to arbitration. On appeal, the court found that the second resolution impaired the lease in violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and that the energy company did not waive its contractual right to demand arbitration. Further, the trial court's decision to stay the proceedings pending arbitration left the court without authority to make any factual findings on issues that were arbitrable under the lease.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was classified as a sexually oriented offender pursuant to her guilty plea to attempted rape of a person under 13 without force, under R.C. 2923.02 and R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(h), she contested her reclassification as a tier III sex offender, under Am. Sub. S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007) (S.B. 10), in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio). The trial court found S.B. 10 constitutional, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said her reclassification violated bars against cruel and unusual punishment and double jeopardy. The appellate court disagreed because S.B. 10 was civil and non-punitive. The reclassification did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because (1) her reclassification was not judicially determined, as it attached by operation of law based solely on her crime, nor did it disturb a prior judicial determination, and (2) sex offender classifications were a legislative mandate, rather than an inherent judicial power, which the legislature could expand or limit. Res judicata and collateral estoppel did not bar the reclassification because it was not a final judgment of conviction, since proceedings under R.C. Chapter 2950 were civil, and no judicial determination was made when she was originally classified or when she was reclassified. Moreover, while the notification provisions of S.B. 10 were constitutional, defendant could request a hearing pursuant to R.C. 2950.11(F)(2) to show that those provisions did not apply to her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of domestic violence, in violation of R.C. 2919.25(A). Defendant contended that the trial court erred in its imposition of sentence and that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court did not err in imposing a 12-month prison sentence on defendant upon his conviction for domestic violence as the sentence was within the middle of the statutory range for a fourth-degree felony set forth in R.C. 2929.14(A)(4), the trial court considered the purposes and principles of sentencing and the seriousness and recidivism factors as required by R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12, and the trial court advised defendant regarding postrelease control. Moreover, evidence was presented that defendant allegedly caused injuries to the victim in a fight which occurred at the victim's home, that defendant threatened to kill the victim, and that defendant had a prior conviction for domestic violence. Further, defendant's conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. While the victim recanted, evidence was presented from which the jury could reasonably conclude that the victim's recantation was designed to protect herself, her child, or defendant. Defendant had been previously convicted of domestic violence in this relationship, and the victim stated to police at the time of the incident that she was afraid defendant would kill her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to rape, under R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), and was sentenced to five to 25 years in prison. The State filed a motion seeking a hearing to determine whether defendant was a sexual predator, as defined by R.C. 2950.01. Following a hearing, the Ashland County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) adjudicated defendant a sexual predator under R.C. 2950.09. Defendant filed a request to be reclassified, which was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in holding that R.C. 2950.09, as rewritten by S.B. 5, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2003), could be imposed on those sentenced prior to its enactment because doing so violated the ex post facto clause of the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions. The appellate court held that, because defendant filed his request for reclassification after R.C. 2950.09 was amended, the statute mandated that the sexual predator classification was permanent and could not be removed or terminated. R.C. 2950.09 had previously been found to be constitutionally valid and thus, was not violative of defendant's rights. Further, because defendant did not appeal from his classification as a sexual predator, he waived his right to challenge his sexual predator classification. Finally, defendant's right to due process was not violated because the trial court held an evidentiary hearing before adjudicating him a sexual predator. Defendant was present at the hearing and had the opportunity to be heard. Moreover, the sexual predator hearing was not required to be held immediately prior to release from prison.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) resentenced defendant to 17 years in prison for burglary and aggravated robbery, with a one-year firearm specification, upon remand from a federal court pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said Foster misapplied Ohio precedent on severance. The appellate court declined to consider this because it could not overrule or modify Foster. Defendant's sentence was void because (1) he was not advised of post-release control at his resentencing hearing, (2) he did not waive this by not objecting at his first sentencing, as he was presumably notified of post-release control at that hearing, and (3) he had to be advised, or re-advised, of post-release control at his resentencing. His indictments were not defective under Colon I for failing to allege a culpable mental state because, if Colon I applied when he pled guilty, (1) as to the aggravated robbery indictment, the crime required no intent beyond that for its theft element, and it was a strict liability crime for which no culpable mental state had to be alleged, and, (2) as to burglary indictments, under R.C. 2911.12(A)(2) and (3), those statutes contained the culpable mental state of &quot;purposefully,&quot; and the culpable mental state of &quot;knowingly&quot; was incorporated in the predicate crime of trespass. Further, the burglary indictment properly tracked R.C. 2911.12, including identifying trespass as a predicate crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Butler County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicted defendant of aggravated murder for an offense which occurred 13 years prior to the indictment, while he was still a minor. He was sentenced to life in prison. The conviction was affirmed on appeal. The cause was before the court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was found dead in her home, having bled to death from nine stab wounds. The fingerprints found remained unidentified. In 1998, new technology identified defendant's fingerprints as a good match to those on objects found in the victim's home. The state's highest court concluded that the Ohio General Assembly intended that the 1997 amendments to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2151 apply retrospectively. Therefore, application of the juvenile statutes in place at the time the State commenced criminal proceedings did not impair defendant's substantive rights within the meaning of Van Fossen and its progeny. Further, application of the amended juvenile statutes to defendant did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, as there was no violation of either U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 or Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. Defendant had virtually no chance of being kept in the juvenile system. Therefore, application of the amended statutes did not increase defendant's available punishment in any manner other than a speculative and attenuated one. Finally, as the delay was justified, the 13-year hiatus between the offense and the indictment did not violate defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a bench trial in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, in violation of R.C. 4511.19. The trial court imposed a sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence was presented as to defendant's erratic driving before an accident, the strong odor of alcohol on his person, his poor performance on two field sobriety tests, the presence of beer bottles/cans in his vehicle, and the presence of alcohol in his blood. On appeal, the court found that defendant waived his claims regarding the admission of evidence by failing to raise them in a pretrial motion to suppress. Nonetheless, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the blood evidence for purposes of determining the presence of alcohol, despite the fact that it was obtained outside the three-hour time limit of R.C. 4511.19(D)(1)(b), because the testimony was sufficient to establish substantial compliance with the regulations for refrigeration, under Ohio Admin. Code 3701-53-05(F), and chain of custody, under Ohio Admin. Code 3701-53-06(A). Moreover, defendant's procedural and substantive due process rights under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16 were not violated by the State of Ohio's use of a certified Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicle record, pursuant to R.C. 2945.75(B)(2), to prove his three prior convictions. Finally, the evidence supported the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a board of elections referred appellants, a group and its founder, to appellee Ohio Elections Commission (OEC), the OEC determined that the group was a political action committee (PAC) and that it had failed to comply with R.C. 3517.10 by failing to designate a treasurer and to file periodic financial statements. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) affirmed the OEC's decision. Appellants challenged the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Ohio's definition of a PAC in R.C. 3517.01(B)(8) and the reporting and disclosure requirements of R.C. 3517.10 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I when applied to an entity with small contributions and expenditures. These requirements, even when imposed on small PACs, were substantially related to the government's sufficiently important governmental interests in providing the electorate with information about money in political campaigns. As for the group's argument that its &quot;major or primary purpose&quot; under R.C. 3517.01(B)(8) could not be express advocacy because it spent such an insignificant amount of money for that purpose, the determination of an organization's &quot;primary or major purpose&quot; was a fact-intensive analysis and such a determination had to weigh a number of considerations. The OEC made its finding that the group's major or primary purpose was express advocacy based on a number of facts, none of which involved how much money was spent or received, including the group's mission statement, voter guide, and website. Finally, the court could not say that the absence of a monetary trigger for PAC designation in Ohio was wholly without rationality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that evidence of her performance on the field sobriety tests administered to her was not admissible because the arresting officer did not strictly comply with the testing procedures adopted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Additionally, the enactment of S.B. 163, Gen. Assem. (2003) was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers doctrine and Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(B). Finally, if the State failed to show compliance with the NHTSA procedures, then the impaired driving charge had to be dismissed. The appeals court first held that S.B. 163 altered the court's interpretation of the existing rules of evidence. Hence, it was unconstitutional. Second, the State failed to meet its burden that the field sobriety tests administered were conducted in strict compliance with the standardized procedures adopted by NHTSA. Thus, evidence of the arresting officer's observations of defendant's performance on the field sobriety tests had to be suppressed. However, the officer had probable cause to make an arrest based on evidence that defendant had been in a one-car accident and smelled of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Suppression was granted as to evidence of defendant's performance on the field sobriety tests, but suppression was denied as to evidence of defendant's erratic driving and the odor of alcohol detected by the officer used to support her submission to a chemical breath test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant manufacturer did not pay required milk inspection fees on out-of-state milk it received. Appellee state agriculture department sought to revoke its license. A hearing was held, and the hearing examiner recommended that the manufacturer lose its license. The department then ordered the license revoked. On appeal, the Defiance County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) entered judgment in favor of the manufacturer. The department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court found that the statutory fee schedule imposed by the department created an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. The appellate court disagreed. It was conceded that the statute establishing the inspection fees, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 917.031, did not explicitly discriminate against out-of-state interests. Nevertheless, the manufacturer argued that the inspection fees were discriminatory both in purpose and in effect. Milk product produced out-of-state was also inspected in the state of origin. The manufacturer argued that since it was assessed a fee twice, which made it more costly, Ohio producers were given an economic and competitive advantage. In rejecting this argument, the appellate court found that it would assume that the out-of-state milk inspection standards were not necessarily the same as Ohio's. Accordingly, the public health interest was served, albeit perhaps tenuously, by the imposition of inspection fees to fund the Ohio inspection program for both in-state and out-of-state product. The Ohio inspection fee schedule was not an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The Licking County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, (Ohio) granted the State of Ohio's motion to dismiss, finding that the juvenile's petition was untimely filed under R.C. 2950.031(E) and 2950.032(E). The juvenile appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile argued that his petition was not untimely filed because a U.S. District Court issued an order staying the 60-day filing requirement for all persons who were reclassified by letter from the Ohio Attorney General. The juvenile also argued that S.B. 10 was unconstitutional as applied to him on the basis that it violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, the right to due process, and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution and the right to due process, the Retroactivity Clause and the Separation of Powers doctrine of the Ohio Constitution. On appeal, the court found that the juvenile's petition was timely filed because of the stay order in the federal court. However, the court also found that (1) the registration and notification provisions of R.C. Chapter 2950 did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because its provisions served the remedial purpose of protecting the public; (2) due process was not implicated by S.B. 10; (3) the power to classify was properly expanded or limited by the Ohio Legislature; and (4) S.B. 10 was not unconstitutional as applied to the juvenile because it did not violate his right to equal protection under the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for one of the drug offenses in Cincinnati, Ohio, Mun. Code ch. 755, and he was given a 90-day exclusion notice from the drug-exclusion zone (zone) by the arresting police officer. Immediately upon conviction of the charge, defendant was served by the city with a notice of a one-year exclusion from the zone. Several months later, defendant was found to be present in the zone and was arrested for criminal trespass. On appeal, defendant argued that the one-year exclusion violated the freedom of association guaranteed by the First Amendment and the right to travel guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The state supreme court held that ch. 755 did not burden the right of association, because it prohibited access only to a particular area of the city, and defendant had not demonstrated that he personally had been denied his First Amendment freedoms. However, ch. 755 did violate the constitutional guarantee of the right of travel because, although it was justified by a compelling interest, it was not narrowly tailored to restrict only those interests associated with illegal drug activity, but also restricted a substantial amount of innocent conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted defendant on one count of illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.041(A), a felony of the third degree. After his arraignment, defendant had entered a not guilty plea to the charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial due to the State's failure to comply with Ohio R. Crim. P. 16 by not disclosing favorable evidence to defendant in the nature of two videotapes showing defendant and another individual whispering back and forth in the booking room of the police station. The court found that it was undisputed that the State did not disclose the videotapes as part of discovery, even though defendant had required all relevant written statements made by a defendant or co-defendant in his request for discovery. However, the record revealed that there was no willful failure by the State to disclose the videotapes and that the trial court attempted to remedy any disadvantage to the defense by allowing defense counsel an hour to view the tapes. As a result, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial since such decision was not arbitrary, unconscionable, or unreasonable. The court further upheld the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.041, as it required an overt act of possessing chemicals for production and did not outlaw mere possession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

He appealed his sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said the facts found to impose a maximum and consecutive sentence had to be found by a jury or admitted by him. The appellate court held findings under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.14(C) and 2929.19(B)(2)(d) to impose a maximum sentence did not implicate his jury trial right, as they did not change the maximum he was subject to. Clear and convincing evidence showed a maximum sentence was proper, as he posed the greatest risk of reoffending. Findings under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.14(E)(4) and 2929.19(B)(2)(c) to impose a consecutive sentence did not implicate his jury trial right, as they did not impose a sentence greater than the statutory maximum. A consecutive sentence (1) was required to protect the public from future crime or to punish defendant, (2) was not disproportionate to his conduct's seriousness, and (3) was not disproportionate to his danger to the public. His new offenses were committed while on probation. He had several felony convictions, including multiple convictions for drug possession, drug trafficking, and receiving stolen property. He twice violated parole. He did not take responsibility for his actions or show remorse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant received four-year prison sentences on each case, to be served concurrently. In the earlier case, he received 354 days of pretrial detention credit. He said it violated equal protection not to give him the same pretrial detention credit in both cases. The appellate court held his appeal in the earlier case was moot, as the trial court gave him the credit he sought. As to the later case, he was not entitled to duplicate pretrial detention credit for any time he was held simultaneously on both cases, under Ohio R. Crim. P. 32.2(D) (repealed) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.191, as the legislature did not intend to allow a defendant held and later sentenced on multiple offenses to multiply his single period of pretrial confinement by the number of his convictions. As defendant said a law that was impartial on its face was applied to him in a discriminatory manner, his equal protection claim had to show intentional or purposeful discrimination. He did not allege intentional or purposeful discrimination in the application of &sect; 2967.191 or Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 5120-2-04(F), nor was there any evidence of such discrimination in the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee insurer sued appellant employee and vehicle owner for subrogation as to the employee's personal injury claim against the owner. The trial court granted summary judgment to the employee and owner, but the Third District Court of Appeals (Ohio) reversed, and the employee and owner sought further review. The court of appeals certified a conflict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, his employer, and the insurer were Louisiana citizens. The vehicle owner was an Ohio citizen, and the injury occurred in Ohio. The appellate court held Louisiana law applied, and, because subrogation was lawful in Louisiana, it was error to grant summary judgment. The supreme court held Louisiana law applied to the subrogation claim. This did not mean Louisiana law applied to all issues in the case. While Louisiana law applied to the subrogation claim, it was necessary to find if the insurer's assertion of subrogation rights under Louisiana law would violate Ohio's public policy. Applying Louisiana law and letting the insurer enforce its subrogation rights would not prejudice any Ohio citizen's interests or undermine the state's public policy. The only parties with a substantive interest in the subrogation claim were Louisiana citizens. The owner would be only marginally affected by the outcome of the subrogation claim because liability issues would not necessarily be decided under Louisiana law. The subrogation action would find only which party the owner had to pay if it was found liable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that although the judge had jurisdiction over his case and sentenced him pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.14(A)(1) and (B), those statutes were unconstitutional under Apprendi v. New Jersey and Blakely v. Washington. The supreme court held the inmate had adequate remedies at law, such as appeal and postconviction relief, to review any alleged sentencing error. A writ of mandamus would not issue on behalf of a party with an adequate legal remedy. Alleged sentencing errors were not ordinarily reviewable by an extraordinary writ. Moreover, the inmate conceded the judge was authorized by &sect; 2929.14 to impose the sentence that he did. Because the inmate had adequate remedies in the ordinary course of law to raise his claims, it was unnecessary to address his constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) of rape of a person under 13, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(A)(1)(b), rape, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(A)(2) and (B), gross sexual imposition involving a person under 13, and pandering obscenity involving a minor, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.321(A)(1), (5) and (C). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant took videos of his sexual contact with the victim. The appellate court held evidence showed he copied, created, or possessed obscenity involving a minor, knowing the images' content and character. Thousands of child pornography images were found on his computers, letting a rational juror find pandering obscenity involving a minor. Viruses could not have caused the images to be on the computers, as some were there before a virus. The jury could see the victim's testimony and cross-examination about her molestation. Defendant and the victim were identifiable on the videos. The State had to allow discovery of photos from the videos, as well as the videos, but a failure to do so was not willful, as it did not know of them until just before a witness testified, and defendant sought no continuance, showing a lack of prejudice. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.321 was not overbroad, despite identical overbroad language in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.322(B)(3), as Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.321 required possessing obscene material, removing the First Amendment's protection. A jury could find images defendant was convicted for were unaltered photographic depictions of real children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father filed a motion to terminate his child support obligation for his disabled emancipated child. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3119.86(A)(1)(a), a magistrate increased the obligation and rejected the father's request to modify the administrative adjustment of the support obligation. The Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division (Ohio), adopted the decision as its preliminary order. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's son had been in an automobile accident when he was 16 years old, which resulted in part of his brain being removed during surgery. The son was unable to care for himself. On appeal, the father argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3119.86(A)(1)(a), which required payment of child support beyond the age of majority if the child was disabled before the support order was entered, was unconstitutional as it violated the Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const. Amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The appellate court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3119.86(A)(1)(a) was reasonable, not arbitrary, and that it rested on a ground of difference between married and divorced parents of disabled adult children which had a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, which was that all persons who were parents of disabled adult children were treated alike, whether pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3119.86(A)(1)(a) or by the common law duty announced in Castle, with respect to their obligations of support. Therefore, the rational basis test was satisfied and the Equal Protection Clause was not offended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's motion to suppress and/or dismiss was denied, he pled no contest to two counts of operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A). The Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) sentenced him to 18 month of incarceration on each count, suspended on condition of two years of community control. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the results of his blood alcohol test. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in concluding that the State substantially complied with the requirements of Ohio Admin. Code 3701-53-05. Because defendant did not notify the State with sufficient particularity of the specific evidence it was obligated to present, the State needed only to demonstrate, in general terms, that it substantially complied with the regulations. Further, the totality of the facts and circumstances available to the officer--the late hour, defendant's failure to use headlights in the dark and his failure to concede that his lights were not on, his indecisive driving, the immediate smell of alcohol upon approach, his admission to having had a few alcoholic beverages, his loss of focus and need to ask repetitive questions, and his slurred speech--were sufficient to warrant a belief that defendant had violated R.C. 4511.19. Finally, R.C. 4511.191(A)(5)(b), permitting compelled blood draws under limited circumstances, was constitutional as the nature of the search was minimally invasive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three separate cases, defendants appealed judgments of the Sixth District Court of Appeals (Ohio), the First District Court of Appeals (Ohio), and the Eleventh District Court of Appeals (Ohio) affirming defendants' resentencings pursuant to R.C. 2929.191 to impose a mandatory term of postrelease control that was previously omitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants said their resentencings violated due process and double jeopardy. The supreme court disagreed because they had no legitimate expectation in the finality of their original sentences lacking a required postrelease control term. Defendants resentenced before Sub. H.B. 137, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2006) (H.B. 137) was enacted had no standing to contest its constitutionality because it was not applied to them. A defendant did not show R.C. 2929.191 usurped the Ohio Supreme Court's power in Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(B) to prescribe procedural rules because he identified no conflicting rule. R.C. 2929.191 did not violate separation of powers because it did not confer review power on an administrative agency, but, instead, let a trial court correct its own judgment entry. H.B. 137 did not violate the one subject rule by including a provision on sealing juvenile records because this was related to H.B. 137's postrelease control provision. A defendant was not properly notified of postrelease control because he was not told mandatory postrelease control terms which applied to him or that such control was mandatory. He could not be resentenced because he had completed his prison term.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of the Sixth District Court of Appeals and the First District Court of Appeals were affirmed. The judgment of the Eleventh District Court of Appeals was reversed, that defendant was discharged, and the trial court was instructed to note on the record that he was not subject to resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee citizen sued appellants, the Ohio Attorney General and a board of elections, in the Medina County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for a permanent injunction and declaratory judgment to enjoin the board from conducting an election for municipal clerk. The trial court denied the Attorney General's motion to dismiss and granted a permanent injunction. The Attorney General appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen contested the constitutionality of a statute allowing a municipal clerk's election rather than appointment. The appellate court held he had no standing to bring a declaratory judgment suit contesting the statute because no real justiciable controversy existed. He denied a direct and concrete injury to himself different than any public injury and did not show a legal interest adverse to the board of elections and/or Attorney General, so there was no real justiciable controversy, and he had no standing to seek a declaratory judgment. The public action exception to the general rule on standing did not apply to a declaratory judgment action, and this was not a rare and extraordinary case in which a contested statute directly and broadly divested courts of judicial power. The statute applied to one county and gave its voters the power to elect the municipal clerk of courts, so it did not broadly and directly divest courts of judicial power. The clerk's appointment was an administrative, and not judicial, act. This was not a &quot;rare or extraordinary&quot; case to which an exception to the normal rules of standing applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's final order and order denying the Attorney General's motion to dismiss were vacated, and the matter was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In determining to impose the use tax on the taxpayer's courses, the TC concluded that the courses were actually taxable computer services training. On appeal, the taxpayer alleged that the services it provided did not qualify as &quot;taxable computer services&quot; under &sect; 5739.01(Y)(1)(b). The Board agreed with the TC's decision. On appeal, the court noted that it lacked jurisdiction over the taxpayer's constitutional claims involving free speech and equal protection, as the claims were not raised in the taxpayer's notice of appeal to the Board, and they were not facial challenges. As the taxpayer failed to specify a void-for-vagueness challenge in its notice of appeal, the court also lacked jurisdiction over that issue. Training on routers and switches involved &quot;computer equipment.&quot; The taxpayer did not show that the Board's decision was unreasonable or unlawful with respect to all but two courses, as most of the courses were within the &quot;for use in business&quot; requirement of 5739.01(B)(3)(e). With respect to the other two courses, as they involved nontaxable application-software training, they were erroneously characterized as taxable by the TC.</SPAN></P>

The trial court imposed consecutive sentences of imprisonment, and it classified defendant as a Tier III sex offender (SO) pursuant to R.C. 2950.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three counts of rape and one count of kidnapping. Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant entered a guilty plea to two counts of rape and one count of attempted kidnapping. Prior to the imposition of sentence, the prosecutor and the victim provided a detailed statement of the facts. The trial court imposed consecutive terms of imprisonment and classified defendant as a SO. On appeal, the court found no error in the imposition of consecutive sentences, although any such error was waived for purposes of appeal. The sentences were within the statutory range and were based on consideration of R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. The offenses were not allied under R.C. 2941.25. The trial court made the proper consideration of applicable factors to satisfy the requirement under &sect; 2929.11(B) of consistency. The SO statutory scheme, which was amended by Am. Sub. S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008), withstood constitutional challenge with respect to ex post facto, retroactivity, due process, and separation of powers claims. The legislation was civil, remedial, and non-punitive in nature. The registration and notification provisions were de minimis procedural requirements.</SPAN></P>

He pled guilty to the new charges. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) denied his subsequent motion to withdraw his guilty plea to the new charges, revoked his judicial release, and sentenced him to 54 months in prison.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was on probation, his probation officer found his journal depicting fantasies about the torture and rape of a number of fictitious minor children. He was charged with violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.321(A)(1) (possessing child pornography), as well as the terms of his probation. His counsel told him to plead guilty to the new criminal charges because he had no defenses. At the hearing on defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, counsel testified that she thought the journal depicted actual, not fictitious, children. The appellate court held that this misapprehension prevented her from providing effective assistance, as she did not advise defendant of defenses to the charges, based on the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that banning possession of child pornography that did not depict real children was unconstitutional, and an Ohio case construing a statute similar to &sect; 2907.321(A)(1) as prohibiting only images depicting real children. Defendant was thus entitled to withdraw his plea. The trial court also erred by increasing defendant's original sentence from the 18 months originally imposed to 54 months when it resentenced him for the earlier charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment denying defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and the 54-month sentence it imposed, were reversed. The case was remanded for re-sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant district board of education sought review of an order of the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which dismissed appellant's complaint, seeking to halt administrative proceedings conducted by appellee Ohio Department of Education. The proceedings concerned a proposed transfer of certain properties out of the school district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petition was submitted to appellee, proposing a repositioning of the border between two school districts. The districts were requested to submit data on issues surrounding the proposed transfer, but appellant chose not to respond. Instead, it chose to commence a federal action to state its claims that racial gerrymandering was being attempted. Appellant's complaint in the instant action asserted that comity and judicial economy considerations required that the state administrative proceedings be halted in deference to a subsequent federal action that was filed by appellant to challenge the proposed transfers on equal protection grounds. The trial court held a bench trial and determined that appellee had an obligation to proceed with the administrative process. The trial court dismissed the action and appellant sought review. The court held that the abstention policy adopted by the Ohio Supreme Court in Zellner was no longer applicable, as the cases were factually distinguishable and the state courts had litigated many such claims. Further, the trial court ruled on appellant's declaratory judgment claim.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's claims that &sect; 2950 violated the Ex Post Facto and Retroactivity Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions were overruled, as were his claims of double jeopardy and vagueness, on the basis of prior decisions. The finding was supported by evidence that appellant had engaged in oral sex with three young children.

The service company alleged that the Commission lacked statutory authority to issue the order, and that the order lacked record support, substantially impaired the obligations of the service company's contracts, and resulted in an unconstitutional taking of property. On appeal, the court found that (1) the Commission acted within its powers under R.C. 4905.06 because its order was related to the protection of the public safety; (2) the record supported the Commission's determination that natural gas service lines presented safety issues and its decision to place service-line responsibility in the hands of the utility company; (3) the Commission did not violate the prohibition under U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant approached a 13-year-old girl, threatened to kill her, and then raped her.

Defendant was convicted and he was sentenced to incarceration. On appeal, the court found that defendant's counsel rendered effective assistance. Defendant's counsel's failure to seek dismissal of the charges, on the grounds that the prosecution was barred by the limitations period, was not ineffectiveness, as defendant could not show prejudice because his arguments, as a matter of law, lacked merit. As the pre-existing six-year statute of limitations period applicable to defendant had not expired when the statutory amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.13 (Am. Sub. H.B. 49, Gen. Assem.

The Ohio Elections Commission did not present sufficient evidence that R.C. 3517.21(B)(1) was actually needed to achieve that aim or even that it did achieve that aim, beyond what counter-speech may feasibly have remedied and thus, the statements on the campaign materials could have been debunked readily and obviously.</SPAN></P>

The evidence supported that the trial court fully discharged its duty to protect the public from future crime by defendant and to punish him in accordance with R.C. 2929.11(A); [2]-Defendant failed to offer any basis to hold that his sentence was directly disproportionate to sentences given to other offenders.</SPAN></P>

Applying S.B. 10 to him did not offend U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10's bar against ex post facto laws because it was remedial, not punitive. Its application did not offend Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28's bar against retroactive laws because he could not expect his conduct would not be subject to future laws. Its application did not offend double jeopardy because it was not punitive. Its application did not offend procedural or substantive due process because he was not denied a substantial liberty or property right and he lacked standing to contest any residency restrictions, as he was in prison. His required registration as a sex offender in person was not unconstitutional as it did not restrain him and it had a remedial purpose, and publicly disseminating his information was not punitive when furthering a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

He agreed to serve at least eight years in prison and further agreed that none of the offenses were allied and, therefore, that none of the convictions would merge at sentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it imposed his sentence. The appellate court held that the sentence was not contrary to law because it was within the statutory guidelines and the trial court indicated that it considered all factors required by law. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to 15 years in prison because, pursuant to R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12, the trial court noted that defendant held his coworker hostage for hours on Christmas Eve, digitally raped her, threatened to kill her, repeatedly bit, choked, slapped, and punched her, threw the victim across the room, and threatened to kill himself. The trial court further acknowledged that, based on defendant's statements to the victim during the incident, he may have killed her had she not been able to escape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Wood County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of vandalism, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.05(A). Defendant was sentenced to consecutive terms of incarceration for the vandalism and for violating his post-release control (PRC), and he was ordered to pay restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant threw rocks through the window of a bar, which was seen by various witnesses. He was convicted and sentenced, and he appealed. The court found that there was no violation of Ohio R. Crim. P. 11 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.19 by the sentence imposed on the PRC violation. The trial court substantially complied with Ohio R. Crim. P. 11 and defendant was clearly apprised of the PRC portion of the sentence. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.141 did not violate defendant's due process rights. There was no error in the denial of defendant's ex parte motion for a preliminary hearing transcript as it was procedurally improper and despite an opportunity to file correctly, he failed to do so. Although defendant's counsel did not properly file an affidavit seeking the sentencing judge's disqualification pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;2701.03, such was not ineffectiveness where the request lacked merit. The fact that the judge was a prosecutor when an assistant prosecutor filed the charges against defendant did not establish personal bias. The denial of a longer continuance in order to secure a witness's return to the courtroom was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the appellate court rejected the argument that Am. Sub. S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007) violated the prohibition on ex post facto and retroactive laws. Moreover, there was no separation of powers, procedural due process, or substantive due process violations. As to res judicata and collateral estoppel, the offender's expectation of finality was limited to his conviction and did not include his former classification. His previous classification was nothing more than a collateral consequence arising from his criminal conduct. As a result, in amending Ohio's classification scheme and making it retroactive to apply to all sex offenders, the Ohio General Assembly did not abrogate a final judgment. Finally, there was no double jeopardy violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state trooper administered a BAC test to defendant by use of a BAC DataMaster cdm, and he sought suppression. At the suppression hearing, defendant stipulated that all regulations pertaining to the Ohio Administrative Code, the administration of the BAC test, the required instrument checks, the solution, and the results were followed, with the exception of Ohio Admin. Code 3701:53-07(D) and 3701:53-09(B). At the hearing, an Ohio Department of Health (ODH) official testified regarding the breath testing and test permit procedures under R.C. 3701.143 and 4511.19(D)(1). The state trooper testified that she had a permit for the BAC DataMaster Standard. The court noted that there were differences between various models of the DataMaster machines and the Intoxilizer, but that they were operationally similar. The court determined that the permit issued by the ODH that authorized operation of the BAC DataMaster Standard also authorized operation of the BAC DataMaster cdm for purposes of Ohio Admin. Code 3701:53-02. As the Director of the ODH was not arbitrary and capricious in allowing one permit to authorize operation of both machines, there was no basis to suppress the results.</SPAN></P>

The inmate had been reclassified as a Tier I sex offender (SO), which required him to register annually for 15 years, and he contested it under R.C. 2950.031(E) and 2950.032(E).</SPAN></P>

After the enactment of S.B. 10, which implemented the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, the inmate was reclassified as a Tier I SO. He contested his reclassification and raised various constitutional challenges to S.B. 10. The trial court summarily overruled the inmate's challenges to S.B. 10 based on prior judicial precedent. On appeal, the inmate's counsel opted to adopt appellate briefs filed in a case that was already pending. Those challenges were based on the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution; the prohibition against retroactive legislation under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28; the double jeopardy provisions of the Ohio and United States Constitutions; the separation of powers doctrine; res judicata and collateral estoppel principles; and the cruel and unusual punishment provisions of the Ohio and United States Constitutions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city recently annexed the corporate land. The appellate court held code violations were strict liability offenses, so the city did not have to prove recklessness. The fact that the corporation's violations preceded the annexation did not bar its convictions because the city could regulate a preexisting nuisance, so the code did not unconstitutionally take corporate property. State building standards did not preempt the code because it did not conflict with the standards and cities were explicitly allowed to impose greater requirements than those minimum standards. The code was not void for vagueness because it told ordinary citizens what was prohibited and prevented arbitrary enforcement. The code was not an unconstitutional taking because it promoted and substantially advanced a legitimate state interest. The code did not violate substantive due process because it was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. The fine was invalid because it was ambiguous whether it applied to each of four convictions or all convictions combined, and indefinite, continuing fines were improper because the corporation could only be sentenced for violations it was convicted of.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation's convictions were affirmed, but the trial court's judgment was reversed as to sentencing only, and the matter was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted of rape, aggravated robbery, and felonious assault. The trial court conducted a sexual predator hearing pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09 due to defendant's rape conviction, and found that the defendant was a sexual predator. The Court of Appeals for Montgomery County (Ohio) reversed the judgment and remanded for further proceedings. The cause was considered pursuant to a discretionary appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09 violated the separation of powers doctrine by usurping the trial court's fact-finding role because it prescribed what evidence trial courts must consider in determining whether a sexual offender was likely to reoffend. The state supreme court held that &sect; 2950.09 did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. The state supreme court held that the factors listed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(2) were guidelines that served an important function by providing a framework to assist judges in determining whether a defendant was a sexual predator. These guidelines provided consistency in the reasoning process. However, these guidelines did not control a judge's discretion.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(2) required a court to consider all relevant factors including, but not limited to, the listed factors. This language required the court to consider the factors, but did not direct the court on what weight, if any, it must assign to each factor. Thus, the appellate court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(2) did not divest a court of its fact-finding powers in assessing the relevancy of each factor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with multiple counts of kidnapping and gross sexual imposition, as well as sexually violent predator specifications, involving two young victims. He entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to imprisonment. He appealed his sentence, and the court held that the trial court erred in imposing a term of post-release control in its journal entry, as that term was not imposed in open court at the sentencing hearing. Accordingly, the trial court violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.19(B)(3)(c) and (d). The court followed case precedents in finding that the sexual predator statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01 et seq., was constitutionally valid, as it was not punitive in nature and there was no violation of the prohibitions against ex post facto laws or retroactive legislation. Although the trial court misstated the definition of clear and convincing evidence by using the term &quot;more than likely&quot; rather than &quot;likely&quot; with respect to defendant's likelihood of committing future sexual offenses, that was harmless error, as the trial court properly considered the factors in Ohio Rev.

One month before his release on parole, the State requested a sexual predator adjudication hearing. The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) found, pursuant to R.C. 2950.09(B)(3), by clear and convincing evidence that defendant was likely to reoffend and labeled him a sexual predator. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the State failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses. The appellate court held that there was clear and convincing evidence to support the adjudication that defendant was a sexual predator as contemplated by R.C. 2950.01(E). Although there were several factors that favored defendant, the trial court adhered to the statutory requirements and considered the relevant factors enumerated in R.C. 2950.09(B)(3). The trial court found, relevant to its determination, the nature of the rape offense which involved someone known, but unrelated, to defendant, his history of drug abuse, and his prior criminal record, which included a prior offense of violence. The trial court also considered defendant's age and his Static-99 evaluation of moderate-high risk category. Finally, it noted that defendant had not lived with a lover for at least two years. Further, defendant waived his constitutional argument and failed to show that he suffered any actual deprivation of his property rights by operation of R.C. 2950.031.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the three offenses and he was sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment. In a prior appeal, the convictions were affirmed, but the sentence was vacated pursuant to Foster and the matter was remanded for resentencing.

XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16, as well as his ex post facto rights. The court noted that such argument had been previously reviewed and rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pled guilty to unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, in violation of R.C. 2907.04(A), the Warren County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) classified him as a tier II sex offender/child victim offender registrant under S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007) (S.B. 10), which was in effect when he was classified and sentenced but not when he committed the crime. He appealed, contesting the constitutionality of S.B. 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said S.B. 10 violated various constitutional provisions. The appellate court held its registration provisions did not offend a bar against retroactive laws because it was expressly retroactive and only remedial. It did not violate the ex post facto clause because it imposed a civil, nonpunitive, regulatory scheme. Criminalizing the failure to register did not make it punitive because this was already a crime, nor did placing it in the criminal code show a punitive intent. Defendant did not overcome the legislature's non-punitive intent with the &quot;clearest proof,&quot; as it was not like public shaming or intended to further retribution and deterrence. A ban on living within 1,000 feet of a school, preschool, or day-care did not apply retroactively if he lived there before July 1, 2007, as he committed his crime before the statute was effective, but no ex post facto violation existed as no affirmative disability or restraint was imposed. Separation of powers was not violated because classifying sex offenders was a legislative mandate. His 25-year registration duty was not cruel or unusual because it was not punishment. The non-punitive statute did not violate double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the decision of the Cuyahoga County (Ohio) Court of Common Pleas, which denied his motion to dismiss an indictment charging him with one count of failure to register as a sex offender in violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had registered as a sex offender in Washington, moved to Ohio but failed to register in Ohio. Defendant contended that &sect; 2950.04 violated due process according to Lambert because it imposed strict liability for an omission regardless of notice or scienter. Affirming the denial of the motion to dismiss and defendant's conviction, the court held that &sect; 2950.04 as applied to out-of-state sex offenders did not violate due process. As long as the offender was on notice from the state of conviction that the offender must register, he was on notice to inquire into the applicable law of the state to which he moved. Defendant was notified of his continuing duty to register as a sex offender for the next 15 years when he was adjudicated delinquent for two counts of child molestation in Washington, and he signed a form acknowledging his duties. As a result, he was unable to argue that he lacked notice or probability of notice, and he was put on notice to inquire into the applicable law of Ohio upon his move. Thus, he had constructive knowledge sufficient to satisfy due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio) held that the Court of Claims had exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether appellant state employee was immune from personal liability under Ohio Rev.

Meanwhile, the Court of Claims found in an immunity-determination hearing that he was acting outside the scope of his employment, and, thus, the trial court had jurisdiction over the matter. The trial court found he was acting within the scope of his employment and, thus, was immune. The appellate court found the Court of Claims had exclusive jurisdiction over the immunity question. It also determined that if the state employee was not allowed to participate in the immunity-determination proceedings, his constitutional rights would be violated. On appeal, the state supreme court found the Court of Claims, by statute, had exclusive jurisdiction over the immunity issue and the state employee's constitutional rights were not violated by his exclusion from participation in the immunity-determination proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician did not request an administrative hearing when he was notified of possible administrative action against his license, so the trial court dismissed his appeal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and found he waived any constitutional challenge to R.C. 4731.22(B)(22) by not raising it in his notice of appeal. The appellate court held the physician's notice of appeal adequately stated the grounds for his appeal, as it was not required to set forth specific facts to support the grounds alleged, and invoked the trial court's jurisdiction. The exhaustion doctrine did not apply to preclude his facial constitutional challenge to &sect; 4731.22(B)(22) because the Ohio State Medical Board had no authority to address such a challenge. Therefore, it would have been futile for the physician to raise the issue administratively, and his failure to seek an administrative hearing did not bar such a challenge. He was entitled to raise a facial constitutional challenge to &sect; 4731.22(B)(22) for the first time on appeal to the trial court because no administrative record was required to decide such a challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, found appellant, a juvenile, to be delinquent based upon two charged offenses of rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), which occurred when he was 14 and 15 years old. The juvenile court also found him to be a serious youth offender, sentenced him, classified him as a Tier III sexual offender pursuant to R.C. 2152.86, requiring him to register for life. Appellant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that R.C. 2152.86 violated his right to due process of law by requiring the juvenile court, without any discretion, to automatically classify him as a Tier III sexual offender. The appellate court held that the automatic registry requirement for Tier III juvenile sexual offenders in R.C. 2152.86 was antithetical to the goals and purposes of the juvenile court system. It removed the discretion of the trial court judge to make certain determinations and deprived appellant of due process to determine the likelihood of recidivism before assigning the lifetime label of sexual offender. Therefore, R.C. 2152.86 was unconstitutional to the extent it prematurely required, at adjudication, the automatic registration as a sexual offender by juveniles based solely on the commission of certain sex crimes, without the opportunity to present rebuttal evidence at such time as the juvenile offender was released from the Department of Youth Services. Due process required that appellant receive a hearing to determine whether he had been rehabilitated before his information was released for all the world to see, especially in light of internet access to such information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Tier III sexual offender classification was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's convictions of three counts of rape and one count of kidnapping were affirmed, he was classified by the trial court as a sexual predator. The Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio) affirmed that classification, and defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said amendments to former R.C. Chapter 2950 enacted in Am. Sub. S.B. 5, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2003), were unconstitutionally retroactive. The supreme court held, as to former R.C. 2950.041(A), the legislature explicitly made the statute retroactive. As to former R.C. 2950.081 and former R.C. 2950.09(D)(2) and (F), the statutes were presumably retroactive because the legislature did not contradict a judicial conclusion to that effect. Despite being retroactive, the amendments were not unconstitutional because former R.C. Chapter 2950 was a remedial, rather than punitive, remedy, despite its consequences. Defendant had no reasonable expectation of finality in the possible removal of his classification. Eliminating the possible removal of the classification, the amendments' more burdensome registration and reporting requirements, and the collection and dissemination of more information about offenders was not driven by a punitive intent but by a desire to protect the public, so they were not unconstitutionally retroactive. The amendments, as applied to defendant, did not violate protections against ex post facto laws because such protections only applied to criminal laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicted defendant of corrupting a minor, trafficking in crack cocaine, both with school specifications, tampering with evidence, and possession of crack cocaine, under R.C. 2925.11(A)(C)(4)(b). On remand, he was resentenced. His motion to vacate his sentence was granted and he was again resentenced to 15 years in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred. The appellate court held that res judicata precluded defendant from raising any issues he raised, or could have raised, in his first direct appeal. Defendant's sentence was only void to the extent the trial court improperly advised him regarding his post-release control obligation. The trial court recognized its error, granted defendant a resentencing hearing where it corrected its error, and reimposed the same sentence. Now, on appeal, defendant was limited to raising issues that arose at the resentencing hearing. Further, his consecutive sentences were also barred by the doctrine of res judicata because the &quot;offending portion&quot; of defendant's sentence was the trial court's incorrect statement that his post-release control term was discretionary when in fact it was mandatory. Consequently, the appellate court could only consider whether the trial court corrected that error, which it did. Regardless, the judicial findings previously required in order to impose consecutive sentences were no longer required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' son died in a physical education class in the school pool. The appellate court held an exception to the district's presumed immunity in Ohio Rev.

Code ch. 3701-31, so immunity under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.03(A)(3) or (5) for discretionary acts was unavailable, but &sect; 2744.03(A)(5) applied to the teacher's claimed negligence in supervising and trying to rescue the son, involving discretionary decisions. The teacher's malice, bad faith, or wantonness were not shown, but whether he was reckless was an issue. The teacher and superintendent did not act outside their employment or official duties, so a liability exception in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.03(A)(6)(a) did not apply, and no statute expressly imposed liability on them. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.03(A)(6)(b), the teacher's reckless supervision of the son was an issue. There was no evidence of the superintendent's malice, bad faith or wantonness, but his operation of the pool may have been reckless, creating a fact issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">R.C. &sect; 169.08(D) was amended to provide that the state no longer paid interest on unclaimed funds it held when the funds' owners claimed them. The general assembly did not retain authority to redefine interest on unclaimed funds as something other than private property. The common-law rule that &quot;interest follows principal&quot; was not subject to legislative repeal as it pertained to the unclaimed-funds statutes. The statutory language actually written did not support the argument that the state's unclaimed funds program was merely a disguised form of an &quot;abandoned&quot; property program, nor did the unclaimed funds escheat to the state, nor were unclaimed funds subjected to a form of &quot;forfeiture&quot; to the government. Beyond a reasonable doubt, the unclaimed funds program generated net interest that the state expropriated. It was unconstitutional for the state to retain interest on unclaimed funds when the Unclaimed Funds Act, R.C. &sect; 169.01 et seq., provided a five-percent administrative fee for services given to owners of unclaimed funds. The nonpayment of interest on unclaimed funds violated the Fifth Amendment, and the plaintiff class was entitled to a remedy under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first sentence of R.C. &sect; 169.08(D) was declared unconstitutional, and the Ohio Department of Commerce was enjoined from enforcing it.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court observed that each of defendant's constitutional arguments had been considered and rejected by the Supreme Court of Ohio. Specifically, the appellate court advised that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950 was neither &quot;criminal,&quot; nor a statute that inflicted punishment; thus, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950 did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. In addition, the appellate court advised that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.03 required notification of the statutory registration requirements to an offender who had been adjudicated a sexual predator. The appellate court found that, after reviewing the transcript from the sexual predator hearing, the trial court read the sexual predator form verbatim to defendant.

On appeal, defendant's first argument was that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.07(E)(2) was void for vagueness. Defendant also argued that the statute violated the commerce clause, and that he was entrapped into violating the statute. As to his constitutional claims, the appellate court found that lacking in defendant's argument was any explanation as to why Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.07(E)(2) was void for vagueness. Further, the appellate court found that the statute was narrowly tailored, and did not have a chilling effect on speech because the offender would have to believe that he was soliciting a minor for sexual activity, a criminal act, before his conduct would be regulated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.07(E)(2). Finally, there was no evidence that supported defendant's contention that the criminal design originated with the police officer and that he implanted the idea of sexual activity with a 14-year-old girl with defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, appellant State challenged the decision of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which declared, in plaintiff construction groups' complaint, that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 4116 was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and thereafter permanently enjoined its enforcement. Appellant proposed intervenor claimed that the trial court erred in denying its motion to intervene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the proposed intervenor argued that the trial court erred when it failed to allow it to intervene as a matter of right under Ohio R. Civ. P. 24(A)(2) or, alternatively, permissively under Ohio R. Civ. P. 24(B). The appellate court concluded that the proposed intervenor was not entitled to intervene either permissively or as a matter of right where its interests were adequately represented by the State. Also on appeal, plaintiffs argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 4116 did not preclude a public authority from entering into a project labor agreement (PLA), therefore no controversy existed justifying the trial court's decision to grant declaratory relief. The appellate court found that the trial court erred when it found Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 4116 unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 4116 did not prohibit a public authority from entering into a PLA and, as such, there was no real controversy that warranted declaratory relief. The statute was not constitutionally infirm on the basis that it was preempted by the NLRA because the State was not acting as a market regulator but rather was acting as a market participant.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held the State had to prove the prior conviction as an element of the crime defendant was charged with, so it would have been reversible error to bar the State from introducing such evidence. The trial court curbed possible prejudice from the introduction of the prior conviction by instructing the jury not to consider it in deciding if defendant committed the charged offense. Defendant did not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(D)(4)(b), allowing introduction of the results of field sobriety tests if recognized testing standards were substantially complied with, was unconstitutional, because the Ohio General Assembly could adopt legislation on the admissibility of evidence which did not conflict with the rules of evidence adopted by the Ohio Supreme Court, and the statute did not conflict with such a rule of evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile, admitted allegations in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division (Ohio), that he committed acts that would constitute the crime of gross sexual imposition, and he was classified as a tier II sexual offender, pursuant to Am. Sub. S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007) (S.B. 10). He appealed his classification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant said S.B. 10 was unconstitutional. The appellate court held prior R.C. Chapter 2950, which S.B. 10 amended, did not violate the ex post facto clause of the United State Constitution because it served the remedial purpose of protecting the public, so it was not punitive. This applied to S.B. 10. Prior R.C. Chapter 2950 did not violate double jeopardy protections because it was neither &quot;criminal&quot; nor did it inflict punishment, and this applied to S.B. 10. S.B. 10 did not implicate due process because (1) due process did not protect &quot;stigma&quot; or &quot;favorable reputation,&quot; and (2) a sex offender registry's public disclosure without a hearing as to whether an offender was &quot;currently dangerous&quot; did not offend due process where an offender was registered based only on the fact of his conviction, as was the case under S.B. 10. S.B. 10 did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because classifying sex offenders into categories was a legislative mandate, not an inherent power of the courts. S.B. 10 was not cruel and unusual punishment because sexual offender notification and registration requirements were not punitive but were remedial measures designed to protect the public.</SPAN></P>

Appellant had been adjudicated as delinquent based on three counts of rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant was adjudicated as delinquent, he was committed to the custody of the Ohio Department of Youth Services for an indefinite term. He was granted early release and placed at a treatment center. Shortly prior to his release from the center, a juvenile sex offender classification pretrial was scheduled. The juvenile court classified appellant as a juvenile sex offender registrant and as a Tier III sex offender. On appeal, the court found that appellant was properly classified pursuant to R.C. 2152.83(B)(1), as such was done within the reasonable time of seven months of the juvenile's release from the center. The repeal of prior sex offender statutes under S.B. 10, &sect; 2, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007), occurred on the same date that the new laws became effective pursuant to S.B. 10, &sect; 1.

The Eleventh District Court of Appeals (Ohio) reversed the convictions, and the State appealed. The Supreme Court also accepted a certified conflict on the question of whether the statutes were overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held R.C. 2907.322 criminalized virtual child pornography and that R.C. 2907.323(A)(3) chilled such protected speech. The supreme court held R.C. 2907.322(B)(3)'s allowance of an inference that a one depicted as a child in nudity-oriented material was a child did not make R.C. 2907.322(A)(5) overbroad as it was an evidentiary tool that did not expand the definition of child pornography to include protected speech. The State had to prove a child depicted in the material was a real child. Applying the reckless culpable mental state to R.C. 2907.323(A)(3) did not make the statute overbroad because it did not prohibit a substantial amount of protected speech, as one still had to have notice of the character of the material possessed and could only be convicted on proof that it showed a real nude child engaged in a lewd exhibition or graphic focus on the genitals. Evidence supporting defendant's convictions was not insufficient as the record did not show experts could not distinguish between virtual and real child pornography, and the trial judge, as factfinder, could find from the images at issue that the State met its burden to show they depicted real children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified questions were answered in the negative, and the judgment of the court of appeals was reversed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, three defendants sought review of judgments entered by the Huron County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which denied each defendant's petition contesting his reclassification as a Tier III sex offender under R.C. 2950.01 et seq., as amended by S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants either pleaded no contest or guilty to sex offenses. Several years after the convictions, defendants were notified that the amendments to R.C. Chapter 2950 brought about S.B. 10 resulted in their reclassification as Tier III sex offenders under R.C. 2950.01(G)(1)(a). The change in classification required defendants, inter alia, to personally register with the local sheriff every 90 days for life. Defendants raised a number of constitutional issues. The court affirmed. Because defendants' crimes were committed prior to the effective date of S.B. 10, they claimed that S.B. 10 violated the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution and Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28; however, no violation occurred as a retroactive statute could affect rights that were merely remedial and civil in nature. S.B. 10 was not punitive in nature as, inter alia, the dissemination of sex offenders' personal information under R.C. 2950.11(A)-(F) was designed to protect the public rather than to punish the offender. Based on precedent, S.B. 10's retroactive application to sexual offenders who pleaded guilty or no contest did not impair the obligation of contract protected by Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One injured party had a &quot;run in&quot; with a bailiff for the county who was also the county court's chief probation officer. That injured party alleged the bailiff walked up behind him and placed a handgun to the back of his head. The trial court found the bailiff was not employed by the county commissioners or the sheriff, who were immune from liability in any event, and that the injured parties had not alleged any set of facts that would constitute a cause of action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The appellate court held the injured parties' assertion of liability based upon the bailiff's violation of a criminal statute was not preserved for review and would have failed in any event. The appellate court held appellees were immune as to the state law claims. However, the injured parties adequately pled a valid civil rights claim. Appellees failed to carry its initial burden under Ohio R. Civ. P. 56(C) with respect to that claim. Appellees cited no evidentiary materials in support of their motion for summary judgment. Thus, they showed neither the absence of factual issues, nor their entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that his convictions for intimidation and using sham legal process were based upon an erroneous interpretation of law, insufficient evidence, and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. However, evidence was presented that defendant was aware he was issuing documents not recognized as legal by Ohio law, but which were titled in a manner to purport to be indictments or judgments or unilateral contracts that affected the public servants in their duties or required them to pay large sums of money to defendant, if the public servant acted or failed to act as defendant wanted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing a five-year sentence. The appellate court held that the trial court complied with the applicable statutes in imposing the sentence, and it was not clearly and convincingly contrary to law. At the time that defendant pled guilty to the charge of robbery, and prior to the occurrence of the second matter involving the stabbing of defendant's stepfather, the trial court specifically apprised defendant that she would receive a five-year sentence for the robbery charge if she violated the terms of community control. The trial court only imposed the five-year sentence for the community control violation; it imposed no additional penalty despite the fact that defendant had committed the additional serious offenses of felonious assault and misdemeanor domestic violence. Further, the record indicated that the trial court considered the factors outlined in R.C. 2929.12, including the seriousness of the conduct, the likelihood of recidivism in relation to defendant's substance abuse and emotional issues, and also considered her limited inpatient treatment as well as her housing issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A pharmacy was robbed and the suspects subsequently fled in a van driven by defendant. Upon apprehending defendant and the van, incriminating evidence was found in the van and a bag which had been discarded by one of the suspects. Defendant was found guilty of aggravated possession of Oxycodone in an amount equal to or exceeding 100 times the bulk amount as charged in the indictment. Since the jury, not the court, determined defendant's guilt there was no Apprendi violation. Defendant's classification as a major drug offender vested the trial court with the discretion to impose an additional prison term upon specific findings concerning recidivism and the seriousness of his conduct. Defense counsel's remarks regarding defendant's failure to testify did not insinuate defendant had a criminal record. The trial court had an evidentiary basis for some, but not all of its finding in support of its determination that the prison terms imposed were demeaning to the seriousness of the offense. The appellate court could not determine from the record to what extent the improperly considered matters may have influenced the length of the prison term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The asbestos manufacturers moved to dismiss the estate's claim, arguing that the estate failed to provide prima facie evidence of asbestosis by failing to produce a chest x-ray report constituting radiological evidence of asbestosis as required by R.C. 2307.92(B). The estate argued that the statutory requirements were inconsistent with current medical standards as they did not provide for the use of the most modern imaging methods available to aid in the diagnosis of asbestosis, i.e., a high resolution CT scan. Further, the estate contended that it substantially complied with the statutory requirements by submitting the CT scan evidence. On review of the order of dismissal, the court held that R.C. 2307.92(B) did not permit substantial compliance as it pertained to the minimum medical requirements needed to maintain an action for nonmalignant injury from asbestos exposure. Strict adherence to the statutory requirements was required; because the estate failed to strictly comply with the requirements, its claim was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for offenses in two counties including gross sexual imposition, in violation of Ohio Rev.

At the time that the first court held the sexual predator hearing, appellant had completed his sentence in that county and was serving a sentence in the other county. The trial court found him to be a sexual predator. The appellate court affirmed because either trial court that had convicted him sexually oriented offenses had jurisdiction to hold a sexual predator hearing pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C)(1). His argument that the provisions in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950 were unconstitutional was overruled as having been previously considered and rejected. Finally, the trial court had clear and convincing evidence for a determination that appellant was likely to commit a sexually oriented offense in the future as he had multiple sex offenses, he committed offenses while on bail, and he committed a sexual offense against a teenager, which shows a high probability of recidivism.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Mahoning County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) that convicted him of cocaine trafficking, crack cocaine trafficking; defendant claimed that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing a disproportionate sentence in violation of R.C. 2929.11(B), and that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the imposition of consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions stemmed from two separate undercover drug transactions. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the six-year sentence defendant received was within the statutory range for one first-degree felony offense and two third-degree felony offenses. The trial court properly considered the principles and factors contained in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. Furthermore, defendant was afforded his allocution rights pursuant to Crim.R. 32(A)(1). Although defendant raised disproportionality during sentencing, he proffered no evidence about the other cases into the record. Consequently, it was impossible to tell whether the other defendants were similarly situated so as to make a comparison with defendant a fair one. Defense counsel clearly advocated for an aggregate term of three years, which would require the sentences to run concurrently. There was not much more that defense counsel could have done to oppose or object to consecutive sentences during sentencing. Consequently, defendant failed to show that counsel was ineffective or that his sentences violated U.S. Const. amend. VI.</SPAN></P>

The trooper testified that as defendant passed him, he observed that defendant was driving under the posted speed limit and that his demeanor and driving mannerisms were unusual. The trooper further testified that as he followed defendant on a four-lane highway, he observed defendant drive across the center hash line from the right lane slightly into the left passing lane by about a tire's width, and then re-entered the right lane. Defendant then drove across the white fog line on two occasions. Defendant then re-entered the right lane abruptly. There was no traffic around the vehicle to force it outside of its lane and no turn signals were utilized during that maneuver. Based on the trooper's testimony, he had reasonable, articulable suspicion that defendant violated R.C. 4511.33 and he initiated a lawful traffic stop after observing defendant commit multiple marked lane violations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the jury verdict in their favor in their action for damages for the personal injuries sustained by appellant wife when she was involved in an automobile accident with appellee. Appellants contended that they were prejudiced by the admission of testimony on appellant wife's non-use of a seat belt to show her comparative or contributory negligence. The court vacated and remanded for a new trial. Former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4513.263(F)(1) provided that the failure of a person to wear a seat belt was not to be considered or used as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. The former version of &sect; 4513.263(F)(1) was applicable in this case since the vehicle accident at issue occurred prior to the effective date of the amendment to &sect; 4513.263(F)(1). The court could not conclude that the jury would have arrived at the same decision as to damages had the seat belt evidence not been erroneously admitted, such that the error constituted reversible error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Realtors, a voting committee and several of its members and resident-electors, filed the original action with the court seeking a writ of mandamus to compel respondent, the Ohio Secretary of State, to treat the video-lottery-terminal (VLT) provisions of Am. Sub. H.B.  1, Gen. Assem. (2009) as subject to referendum and to discharge her duties pursuant to Ohio Const. art. X and R.C. 3519.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court narrowed the legal issue before it to whether the VLT provisions of H.B. 1 were an appropriation for the current expenses of the Ohio state government and were, therefore, not subject to referendum pursuant to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 1d. After careful review, the court held that its original jurisdiction had been properly invoked, that mandamus was an appropriate remedy, and that the VLT provisions of H.B. 1 were subject to referendum. The court held that the VLT provisions of H.B. 1 did not fall within any of the exceptions to the right of referendum in that they were neither laws providing for tax levies, nor appropriations for the current expenses of the state government, nor emergency laws necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety. Therefore, they were subject to referendum. As a result, the court held that relators had established entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ sought by realtors and directed the secretary of state to treat the VLT provisions as subject to referendum. The court stayed the amendments to the relevant statutes for 90 days from the date of its decision in order to allow realtors a meaningful opportunity to circulate a referendum petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate entered a guilty plea to a charge of unlawful sexual contact with a minor, in violation of R.C. 2907.04.

The trial court thereafter denied the inmate's motion to be sentenced under the version of Chapter 2950 that was in effect at the time that he committed the offense, rather than after the major changes took effect on January 1, 2008. The inmate was designated a Tier II sex offender under the current version of Chapter 2950, S.B. 10. Accordingly, he was subjected to registration and classification requirements. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's decision, finding that the provisions of S.B. 10 did not violate the Ohio Constitution's ban on retroactive laws. On further review, the court held that S.B. 10 violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. It held that the registration requirements of the new scheme applied retroactively, and that the various provisions were punitive as applied to a defendant who committed sex offenses prior to the enactment of S.B. 10.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) to abduction and two gross sexual imposition counts. He was sentenced to 17 months in prison on each imposition count, to be served consecutively, into which the abduction conviction merged. He was also classified as a sexual predator. He appealed the acceptance of his guilty plea, his sentence, and his classification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said his guilty plea was not knowing, intelligent or voluntary. The appellate court held his Crim. R. 11 hearing complied with the Rule's constitutional and nonconstitutional provisions, competent counsel represented him, and a complete and impartial hearing was held on his motion to withdraw. A claim that Foster did not apply to him was not ripe because he had not yet been sentenced under Foster. His sentence was void because unconstitutional provisions were used to impose consecutive sentences. Counsel's stipulation to a sexual predator classification was not ineffective because (1) the trial court classified defendant based on evidence at a hearing, and (2) defendant derived a benefit from this strategic stipulation, as he escaped a possible life sentence. In classifying him, the trial court created a clear record, deferred to a psychiatric opinion that he was at a &quot;high&quot; risk to reoffend, and stated factors most relevant to its decision, which were his criminal record, including a gross sexual imposition conviction, and an abduction conviction, for which he was classified as a sexually oriented offender. It also found the victim was a young, unrelated, stranger.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions and sexual predator classification were affirmed, but his sentence was vacated, and the matter was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After sentencing defendant for burglary and forgery, the Mercer County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) resentenced him pursuant to R.C. 2929.191 to notify him of post-release control and issue a corrected sentencing entry. Defendant appealed his resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said imposing post-release control violated finality of sentencing. The appellate court held the trial court could resentence him under R.C. 2929.191 and judicial precedent because it originally did not include notice of post-release control in its judgment entry and resentenced him before his prison term expired. This did not violate finality of sentencing or double jeopardy because notice of post-release control was a statutory term of his sentence, so including such notice in his sentencing entry did not enhance his punishment or violate the constitution, nor was it unforeseeable. The State's failure to appeal this issue did not waive it because the lack of notice of post-release control made his sentence void. The trial court's resentencing hearing under R.C. 2929.191(C) before issuing a corrective judgment entry was not a required new and complete resentencing hearing, as it only told defendant he would be subject to post-release control and memorialized this in corrective entries. R.C. 2929.191 did not offend the one-subject rule as Am. Sub. H.B. 137, Gen. Assem. (Ohio) did not contain provisions so unrelated as to manifestly or fraudulently violate that rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's corrective sentencing entry was vacated and the matter was remanded with instructions to conduct a de novo sentencing hearing and notify defendant of post-release control before his prison term expired. The trial court's judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant said S.B. 10 was unconstitutional. The appellate court held prior R.C. Chapter 2950 did not violate the ex post facto clause because it served a solely remedial purpose of protecting the public, so it was not clearly punitive. This applied to S.B. 10. Prior R.C. Chapter 2950 did not violate double jeopardy protections because it was neither &quot;criminal&quot; nor did it inflict punishment, and this applied to S.B. 10. S.B. 10 did not implicate due process because (1) due process did not protect &quot;stigma&quot; or &quot;favorable reputation,&quot; and (2) public disclosure of a state's sex offender registry without a hearing as to whether an offender was &quot;currently dangerous&quot; did not offend due process where he was registered based only on his conviction, as was the case under S.B. 10. S.B. 10 did not violate separation of powers because classifying sex offenders into categories was a legislative mandate, not an inherent judicial power. S.B. 10 was not cruel and unusual punishment because sex offender notification and registration requirements were not punitive, but were remedial measures designed to protect the public, so they did not implicate protections against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Huron County (Ohio) that convicted defendant of grand theft and eight counts of burglary, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2913.02(A)(1), and/or (3); 2913.02(B)(5); and 2911.12(A)(3). On appeal, defendant argued six assignments of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment stemmed from a string of events which involved defendant's alleged theft of an automobile in Lucas County, and the use of that vehicle to visit various schools and to commit theft. Defendant pleaded not guilty. Witness testimony indicated that defendant allegedly engaged in a series of stops at various Huron County locations, whereupon he engaged in various acts of theft. On appeal, defendant contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.12 was unconstitutional in that it violated Ohio Const. art. 1 &sect; 10. The appellate court found that defendant confused the determination of where venue was proper and proof of venue at trial. Defendant's actions began in Lucas County with the alleged theft of the keys and the car; the vehicle was then taken into Huron County. Evidence was presented that defendant stole a vehicle, and then used that vehicle to travel from place to place, using stealth or deception to gain entry to restricted areas of schools or private homes. Finally, the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of prior acts, since it was relevant to establish motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Mahoning County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which convicted him of attempted burglary based upon his guilty plea, and sentenced him to a five-year maximum term of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for burglary and entered a guilty plea to a reduced charge of attempted burglary upon the State's agreement to adopt the presentence investigation recommendation if favorable to defendant, or alternatively to stand silent at sentencing. Upon defendant's sentence to the maximum term of imprisonment, he appealed and the court reversed the conviction and sentence. The court found that the trial court had given an insufficient allocution, pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(C)(2)(c), where defendant was informed of his right to a jury and possibly his right to confront his accusers, but there was no information as to his self-incrimination privilege or to his right to compulsory process. There was no support for defendant's claim for specific performance or breach of the plea agreement based on a promise of entering a plea in exchange for a four-year sentence. The court noted that defendant was not personally advised at the plea hearing that the parole board could impose post-release controls. Accordingly, on remand the trial court was directed to fully inform defendant as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2943.032(E), 2929.19(B)(3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to one count of unlawful conduct with a minor. Following a sexual offender classification hearing, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B), the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) classified defendant as a sexual predator, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01(E). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the sexual predator statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01 et seq., violated the Ohio and the United States Constitutions as ex post facto legislation. The appellate court held that, because sexual offender registration laws were not punitive in nature, they did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws. Therefore, Ohio's sexual predator statute was constitutionally valid. Further, the trial court was presented with clear and convincing evidence to support its ultimate adjudication that defendant was a sexual predator as contemplated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01(E). It adhered to the statutory requirements and considered the factors enumerated in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(3) and specifically stated that the following factors were most relevant to the sexual predator determination: defendant's age of 34; his past criminal record, which included an earlier conviction for unlawful sexual conduct with a minor; the victim's age of 14; and that defendant had impregnated two minors under the age of 16 within the previous three years. There was no error in considering defendant's juvenile record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest to two charges of gross sexual imposition, with physical harm specifications. Defendant was sentenced to two to 10 years; however, his sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation for three years. Defendant violated his probation and the court reimposed his original sentence. Prior to his release, the department of rehabilitation and correction recommended that Defendant be adjudicated a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C). The trial court adjudicated defendant a sexual predator and defendant appealed. The court determined that defendant was a sexual predator because defendant was likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses. This determination was supported by clear and convincing evidence. Statements by the state's witness were sufficiently reliable to constitute admissible evidence. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 constituted a valid use of the state's police power, and therefore did not violate Ohio Const. art. I &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendant, challenging the constitutionality of budget bill provisions enacted by the legislature which reduced or eliminated municipalities' authority to regulate use or public rights-of-way by public utilities and telecommunications operators and limited their authority to recover costs imposed upon them by such uses. Plaintiffs sought, through document requests and interrogatories, information relating to meetings or communications between state representatives, their staffs, and representatives of utility service providers or cable operators. The State objected, claiming immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause, Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 12. Trial court denied plaintiffs' motion to depose legislatures. However, it ordered production of the corporate representatives' identities who had met with legislators. Defendant appealed and plaintiffs moved to dismiss. The court dismissed. Legislators were not entitled to immunity as the narrowly tailored discovery order did not interfere with the legislative process that immunity was designed to protect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's appeal dismissed; because the information ordered disclosed by the trial court was not within the scope of legislative privilege, the trial court's discovery order was not a final appealable order. Plaintiffs' motion to place appeal on accelerated calendar rendered moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a trial in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), defendant was convicted of sexual battery in violation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(13). He appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss because R.C. 2907.03(A)(13) on its face violated the Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">R.C. 2907.03(A)(13) prohibited a peace officer from having sexual conduct with a minor more than two years younger than the officer. The court held that while the State might have a legitimate interest in protecting minors from those who might use their undue influence over them in order to pursue sexual relationships, R.C. 2907.03(A)(13) bore no rational relationship to a legitimate government interest. Unlike the other subsections, R.C. 2907.03(A)(13) required no intent on behalf of the offender and no relationship or occupational connection between the offender and the victim. One's occupation as a peace officer alone, without more, did not provide a person with an unconscionable advantage over a minor. Consequently, the State's method or means of achieving its interest was not rational.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment. It remanded the case with instructions to grant defendant's motion to dismiss with respect to his claim declaring R.C. 2907.03(A)(13) violative of the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Ohio constitutions. The trial court was also ordered to vacate defendant's conviction and sex offender classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attempted to make a left turn onto a street when he pulled into the victims' lane of travel and struck the victims' motorcycle.

Defendant failed several field sobriety tests. Defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(D)(4)(b), governing the admissibility of field sobriety tests, violated the separation of powers doctrine because it infringed upon the state high court's exclusive authority under Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(B) to promulgate rules of evidence. Because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(D)(4)(b) did not conflict with Ohio R. Evid. 702, the legislature did not infringe upon the judiciary's power to enact evidentiary rules. Expert testimony governed by Ohio R. Evid. 702 was not required as a predicate to admission of the results of a field sobriety test. The State presented sufficient evidence that defendant caused the accident in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.08(A)(1), as the State presented evidence that defendant turned left into the victims when the victims had the right-of-way.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was a passenger in a motor vehicle operated by his wife. The vehicle smashed into a utility pole, causing the insured to sustain permanent injuries. The insurer denied coverage claiming an intrafamily exclusion. On appeal, the insured argued that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the insurer by finding the intrafamily exclusion denied the insured the right to pursue uninsured motorist coverage. The insured also argued that the policy was an attempt to thwart Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18 and was against public policy. The appellate court concluded that the trial court was correct in granting judgment for the insurer. There was no coverage under the main policy by operation of the policy language and the policy provisions were not ambiguous or contradictory. In addition, the appellate court found that the policy's language had properly followed the allowable exclusions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18 and that it appeared to be the specific intent of the Ohio General Assembly to allow insurance carriers to contractually limit their exposure. The legislature did so by providing for the exceptions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18(J).</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4123.93 and 4123.931, which were the Ohio workers' compensation subrogation statutes, as enacted by Sub. S.B. 227, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured while working for the employer, who participated in the state insurance fund. The employee filed suit, alleging an employer intentional tort, and she sought workers' compensation benefits from the OBWC. The claim was allowed, and certain payments were made with a possibility of additional future compensation. The employee alleged that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4123.93 and 4123.931, as enacted by Sub. S.B. 227, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2003), violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect;&nbsp;2, 16, and 19, and the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. In resolving cross-motions for summary judgment, the court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;4123.931 removed the risk to a claimant of estimated future expenditures by creation of a trust account. The settlement provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4123.93 and 4123.931 removed constitutional infirmities of the former statutory scheme with respect to the proof regarding double recovery in settlements. There was no violation of equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2 under a rational basis level of review, as claimants of an employer intentional tort were not distinguished from other claimants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the employer's motion for summary judgment and granted the OBWC's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners purchased property in contemplation of opening an adult store. Permits to remodel the existing store area had been granted, and the owners expended sums on renovation of the premises. However, the city enacted Wooster, Ohio, Codified Ordinance 1122.16(j) prior to the time that the owners' store was open or operating as a sexually oriented business. The city then revoked the owners' zoning permit and filed suit. The trial court held that the ordinance was valid and constitutional, it enjoined the owners from using the premises for a sexually oriented business, and it dismised their counterclaims for a declaratory judgment in their favor, an injunction against the city, and attorney's fees. On appeal, the court found that the ordinance was constitutional, as the city had the authority to enact zoning regulations that combated the secondary negative effects of such businesses. The ordinance was not a content-based restriction on speech in violation of the First Amendment. The business did not qualify as a nonconforming use, as it was not &quot;lawfully operating&quot; at the time that the ordinance became effective. Lastly, there was no finding that the city had &quot;unclean hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The case was dismissed with prejudice. The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted defendants' motions for sanctions and awarded attorney fees to defendants. The attorney appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney argued that the trial court erred when it imposed sanctions pursuant to R.C. &sect; 2323.51 and Civ. R. 11. The appellate court held that R.C. &sect; 2323.51 and Civ. R. 11 did not conflict and thus, R.C. &sect; 2323.51 did not violate Ohio Const. art. IV. A plain reading of R.C. &sect; 2323.51 and Civ. R. 11 revealed that, although different language was used, both the statute and the rule imposed the same requirement on an attorney: to prosecute only claims having merit under existing law. Further, the trial court properly found that the attorney engaged in sanctionable conduct for (1) bringing a loss of consortium claim, (2) including all defendants in the allegation that the patient was called a drug addict and told to leave the hospital because she did not have insurance, (3) failing to dismiss the case after learning that the case totally lacked merit and that his clients did not want to proceed, and (4) alleging punitive damages in the refiled complaint without any basis. Additionally, the evidence supported the award of attorneys fees. Finally, all of the parties filed their motions for sanctions within the 21-day period required by R.C. &sect; 2323.51(B)(1).</SPAN></P>
