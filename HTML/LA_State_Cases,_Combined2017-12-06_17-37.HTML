<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-In defendant's death penalty case, counsel was not ineffective in litigating the motion to suppress his custodial statements because defendant appeared completely coherent and, before giving his second statement in which he placed himself inside the taxi, was again advised of his rights and waived them; defendant's conduct thus indicated he made a knowing and intelligent waiver; [2]-Counsel's decision not to draw further attention to the letters and seek their admission in full form under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:450 was strategic because the damaging nature of much of the content that was admitted suggested that other redacted portions might have been harmful to the defense; defendant therefore could not shown that counsel unprofessionally erred by failing to introduce the letters in complete form.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 9:2800.17 was unconstitutional as applied retroactively, because the homeowner's causes of action arising from the demolition of his house accrued before the effective date of the statute.</SPAN></P>

VI, &sect; 29(D)(1) required the Louisiana Legislature when it enacted a tax exclusion to treat tax authorities in all parishes the same or to make tax authorities in all parishes act the same. HOLDINGS: [1]-Under La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 29(D)(1), a legislative tax exclusion must treat all local tax authorities the same. Because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:301(14)(g)(i)(bb) (2013) (current version at La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:301(14)(g)(i)(bb)(I)) mandates that tax authorities in East Feliciana Parish, Louisiana apply the exclusion--but for tax authorities in all other parishes application of the exclusion remains optional--La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:301(14)(g)(i)(bb) is unconstitutional; [2]-Severance of the offending mandatory language in La. Rev. Stat.

Const. art. I, &sect; 4 (a question certified by the United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit). HOLDINGS: [1]-The railroad was not entitled to exclusive use of the land on which it had only a right of use servitude, because under Louisiana law, a right of use was a limited personal servitude, not ownership; [2]-Section 48:394 applied retroactively because it was a procedural law that did not impair contractual obligations or disturb vested rights; [3]-Until the LPSC ruled on the railroad's intent to close the private crossings, the railroad's claim that &sect; 48:394 effected a temporary physical taking of its property was not ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of aggravated kidnapping and four counts of armed robbery for crimes committed when defendant was 16 years old, and the trial court imposed a mandatory term of life imprisonment without parole for the kidnapping and four 10-year terms, also without benefit of parole, for the armed robberies, but subsequently amended the sentences. The Court of Appeal, Louisiana, affirmed. The State sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Louisiana Supreme Court held that parole eligibility restrictions were proper on defendant's four 10-year sentences for four armed robberies. No Eighth Amendment violation arose from the 70-year sentence that resulted from combining the 40 years for armed robberies with a consecutive sentence of life for aggravated kidnapping, with parole possible after 30 years under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:574.4(D). The court held that although the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment forbade the imposition of life in prison without parole for juveniles committing non-homicide crimes, that holding of the U.S. Supreme Court applied only to sentences of life in prison without parole, and did not apply to a sentence of years without the possibility of parole. Nothing in U.S. Supreme Court case law addressed the current situation: a defendant convicted of multiple offenses and given term-of-year sentences, that, if tacked onto his life sentence parole eligibility date, equated to a possible release date when defendant reached the age of 86. The trial court properly amended defendant's life sentence to allow parole eligibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court amending defendant's four 10-year sentences for four armed robberies, affirmed the amended life sentence for kidnapping, and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff teachers' unions brought a declaratory judgment action against defendants Department of Education and Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) in the 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, seeking a declaration that La. Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 99 and 2012 La. Acts 2 were unconstitutional. This district court found both measures unconstitutional, and defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Resolution 99 and Act 2 were part of a comprehensive school choice program. The most essential funding effect of Resolution 99 was that it provided funding for voucher programs and a Course Choice Program to be paid to nonpublic entities from the Minimum Foundation Program (MFP), pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:4017. La. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 13(B), clearly restricted the use of MFP funds to parish and city school systems. Under Section 13(A), assistance could be given to nonpublic schools in the form of textbooks and other instructional materials; under Section 13(B), the MFP funds were reserved for &quot;parish and city school systems.&quot; The court did not need to determine whether local funds were also diverted to nonpublic schools because the MFP formula considered both state and local funds and MFP funds were being unconstitutionally diverted to nonpublic entities. Additionally, Resolution 99 was enacted in violation of La. Const. art. III, &sect; 2(A)(3)(a), because it was introduced on the 57th calendar day of the regular session of the Senate. The bill did not contain incongruous and unrelated matters in violation of the single object rule, La. Const. art. III, &sect; 15(A) and (C).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the holding that 2012 La. Acts 2 was unconstitutional and rendered judgment declaring Resolution 99 as void from the outset.</SPAN></P>

The State took a writ to the Court of Appeal of Louisiana, which was denied by a vote of 2-1. The state supreme court granted the State's application for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Const. art. I, &sect; 17(A) was enacted to limit the time period in which a criminal defendant charged with a non-capital offense could exercise his constitutional right to waive a jury trial. The trial court erred by granting defendant's motion to declare La. Const. art. I, &sect; 17(A), as amended in 2010, unconstitutional after he was prohibited from making an untimely waiver of his right to a jury trial in a second degree murder case. The Supreme Court of Louisiana held that the provisions of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 17(A) at issue were constitutional under U.S. Const. amend. VI and XIV and the state constitution. Although the right to trial by jury was constitutionally protected under both the federal and state constitutions, there was no federal or state constitutional right to demand trial before a judge sitting alone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Record landowner sought review of a decision from the Court of Appeal, Fifth Circuit, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, which affirmed a district court's decision to grant summary judgment in a concursus proceeding filed by plaintiff oil, gas, and mineral interest owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved a 1925 tax sale where there was a failure to give notice of the pending tax sale to the property owner. The district court found that the tax sale was an absolute nullity and dismissed the landowner's claim based on a violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV under Mennonite Board of Missions v. Adams. The appellate court affirmed. In reversing, the supreme court determined that Mennonite could not have been applied retroactively to invalidate the instant 1925 tax sale for lack of adequate notice. Under the United States Supreme Court's retroactivity jurisprudence, a new rule of constitutional law announced by the Court applied to all future cases and cases pending on direct review on the date the Court's decision was rendered. Further, retroactivity was limited by the doctrines of res judicata and statutes of limitations or repose. The instant case was not pending on direct review at the time Mennonite was decided, and a suit to annul the tax sale was perempted fifty-three years before Mennonite. Summary judgment was inappropriate because there were genuine issues of material fact regarding ownership of the disputed property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer requested a refund of use taxes alleged to have been inadvertently paid on raw material purchases. The tax collector denied the request without stating any reasons. The taxpayer submitted further requests adding a second raw material and more tax years. After failing to respond to a second and third request, the collector denied a fourth request. The taxpayer requested a redetermination hearing within 30 days of the denial and promptly filed suit after the collector declined to reconsider the denial. The court held that the taxpayer was not limited under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 47:337.63(A)(1)(a), 47:337.77(F), 47:1576(A), 47:1621(F) to the protest procedure as its remedy under La.

Ann. &sect; 14:30.1 and sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor. The Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans, Louisiana, affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. Defendant again appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an alleged act of retaliation, defendant fired shots into the victim's home, striking and killing two victims. A survivor identified defendant as one of the shooters. Before he died, the victim told witnesses that defendant shot him. During jury voir dire, defense counsel attempted to use a back strike under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 799.1, but the district court refused, advising that it only permitted back strikes on a &quot;per panel&quot; basis. In rebuffing defendant's attempt to peremptorily back strike the juror (provisionally selected as a juror from the first voir dire panel) at the end of the fourth panel, but before the jury panel was sworn in as a whole, the district court violated art. 799.1. The court concluded that a harmless error analysis applied, but that the court of appeal had misapplied it; the State had the burden of showing that the jury's verdicts were surely unattributable to the presence of the juror. Given that the verdicts were less than unanimous and the objectionable juror was identified before jury selection was concluded, the State failed to meet this burden.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the court of appeal, vacated defendant's convictions and sentences, and remanded the matter to the district court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant oil companies filed a writ seeking review of two rulings from the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit (Louisiana), which reversed the trial court's partial summary judgments limiting plaintiff landowners' potential recovery of damages for alleged pollution and dismissing one of the oil companies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition alleged that oil and gas exploration and production under a mineral lease had polluted the owners' property. During discovery, one of the companies admitted responsibility under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:29(C) for environmental damage and moved to refer the case to the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources to develop a remediation plan. The court held that pursuant to &sect; 30:29(H), the landowners were not precluded from receiving an award in addition to the remediation damages that would be paid into court to fund the plan under &sect; 30:29(D)(1). As a procedural statute,&nbsp;&sect; 30:29 did not limit the substantive rights of landowners arising out of either the implied obligation to repair or restore a thing leased under La. Civ. Code Ann. arts. 2683, 2686, 2687, 2692 or the implied remediation obligation arising out of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31:122 where a mineral lessee acted unreasonably or excessively. Determinations regarding those implied obligations, as well as tort claims arising under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315, were for the finder of fact. The dismissal of one company was improper because a genuine issue of material fact existed as to its alleged successor status.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 17:176(F), 17:176(G), and 17:236.3 violated La. Const. art.

They were special laws because (1) they did not apply to all Louisiana athletic associations doing the same function as the LHSAA, and (2) they concerned prohibited subject matter by amending a private corporate charter. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:513(A)(1)(b)(v) did not apply to the LHSAA because it was not subject to the Open Meetings Law, La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42:11 et seq., as no public entity formed it. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:513(J)(4)(a) violated equal protection because (1) it treated LHSAA differently from similar groups by subjecting it to the Louisiana Legislative Auditor's authority based on the BESE's decision to adopt its scholastic rules, and (2) it furthered no legitimate state interest, as the state had no such interest in looking at LHSAA's finances, nor was it rationally related to this interest. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:513(J)(4)(b) was unconstitutional because it was not severable from La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:513(J)(4)(a).</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the petition, and the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Parish of Acadia, Louisiana, affirmed, holding on its own motion that &sect; 13:4210 was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The last day of trial in the underlying child custody proceeding was March 18, 2011.

The mother argued that the court of appeal was not procedurally correct in raising the issue of constitutionality on its own motion. The court noted that there was an exception to this rule if a statute was unconstitutional on its face. In this case, the statute was unconstitutional on its face. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4210 ran afoul of the constitutional mandate in La. Const. art. V &sect; 25(C), granting exclusive original jurisdiction over judicial discipline to the Louisiana Supreme Court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed after he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death, but the supreme court affirmed, stating in part that because there was no actual conflict of interest, the district court's actions comported with applicable law and the defendant received constitutionally effective, conflict-free representation. Furthermore, any failure to fully disclose the specifics of a deal, which importantly was not effectuated until six months after trial, did not in any way undermine confidence in the outcome of defendant's trial. Accordingly, no Brady violation occurred. The sentence was proper because the jury's finding of two aggravating circumstances was supported by the evidence. One victim testified that she and the other victim, her boyfriend, were robbed of approximately $30 by defendant and his two co-conspirators, while the three men were all armed with a variety of knives, machetes, and samurai swords. She further testified she and her boyfriend were taken from where they had been sleeping, blindfolded, and then led into the woods by the three men, who all brutally raped her in front of her boyfriend.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, city and employee, filed a writ of certiorari application, challenging the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Parish of Avoyelles, Louisiana, finding no error in the trial court's ruling that defendants' demand for trial by jury under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5105 was unconstitutional by violating the right to equal protection of plaintiffs, driver and passengers. The writ application was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee struck a vehicle operated by the driver while he was backing an emergency fire department vehicle into a fire station. Plaintiffs filed suit, and defendants requested a trial by jury. The trial court granted plaintiffs' motion to strike the jury trial, and ordered the case be tried as a bench trial. Defendants argued plaintiffs were not denied equal protection of the law because plaintiffs had several opportunities to demand a jury trial after the city passed the resolution. The reviewing court held that the resolution passed by the city satisfied the requirement that the waiver pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5105(D) be a blanket waiver, waiving the right to a non-jury trial in all cases, not in a specific suit. Also, plaintiffs were afforded the opportunity to request a jury trial within ten days of service of defendants' supplemental answer pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1733. The fact that the city's resolution was passed after the original petition was filed did not deprive plaintiffs of the opportunity to later file a motion for jury trial.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court reversed, finding that the conviction could not be supported because defendant's criminally negligent act of leaving her young children alone in the middle of the night was not a direct act of killing, but was instead a criminally negligent act of lack of supervision that resulted in her child's death. Defendant was instead found guilty of the lesser-included offense of negligent homicide.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act authorized the Board of Secondary and Elementary Education (BESE) to grant waivers exempting school districts and individual schools from complying with a number of statutes provided for in Title 17, the Education Code. Under the Act, a waiver could not be presented to the BESE unless a majority of the classroom teachers employed in the school, voting by secret ballot, vote in favor of inclusion of such school in the waiver request. At this point, no waiver had been granted under the Act, or even requested. The association asserted that the Act improperly delegated legislative authority to the BESE, it was a prohibited local or special law, it violated due process and equal protection and it improperly allowed the BESE to suspend law. The supreme court found that the instant case presented no justiciable controversy currently amenable to resolution by this court. The association failed to demonstrate any real hardship requiring pre-enforcement review of the statute. It was not certain that a waiver would be requested or granted under the statute, and the association would not be harmed by declining review of the statute at this point in time.</SPAN></P>

In granting the motion to quash, the trial court refused to declare the article unconstitutional, but nevertheless quashed the indictment based on the underlying unconstitutionality of the article. The court determined this was a substantive declaration of unconstitutionality, so that the case was within the court's jurisdiction under La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(d). The court determined that because defendant neither alleged nor proved that the subject article had any serious effect on his rights, he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the article. He failed to show that the circumstances of his indictment would have been any different had the grand jury selection process been conducted by a jury commission, rather than by the judicial administrator.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant local assessors sought certiorari review of a decision from the Court of Appeal, First Circuit (Louisiana), which upheld the district court's dismissal of their cross-claims and reconventional demands/cross-appeals in a suit brought by appellee taxpayers for judicial review of the ad valorem taxes assessed against the taxpayers' natural gas pipelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In accordance with a court order on remand, the Louisiana Tax Commission (LTC) obtained the assessors' assistance in reappraising and reassessing the taxpayers' pipelines, which were public service properties as defined in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1851(M). The court held that because the LTC had a constitutional and statutory duty to appraise, value, and assess the pipeline properties as provided in La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 18(D) and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 47:1853, 47:1957(A), the reassessments were central assessments, not local assessments. Obtaining the assistance of assessors, even when pursuant to a court order, did not constitute a delegation of the LTC's authority to the assessors relative to the assessment of the public service properties. Accordingly, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1856 governed the taxpayers' rights in the proceedings. The court concluded that the assessors could challenge the LTC's final determination of the reassessment valuations on cross-appeal, notwithstanding case law that precluded assessors from initiating such challenges, because the assessors did not initiate the action; rather, the taxpayers amended their pleadings to join the assessors as defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a ruling that the reassessments were central assessments, reversed the dismissal of the assessors' cross-claims and reconventional demands/cross-appeals, overruled the taxpayers' exception of no right of action, and remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sought an ex parte order to perpetuate his testimony, alleging that he had been diagnosed with asbestosis and that it was unlikely that he would survive more than six months.

Plaintiffs brought a wrongful death and survival action against defendants. The trial court denied defendants' motion to strike the deposition, ruling that it could be read at trial. On appeal, the court held that the employee's testimony was inadmissible as a deposition under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1450 because defendants did not have the opportunity to cross-examine him. The employee's testimony was inadmissible as a dying declaration under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 804(B)(2) because the deposition was not taken when he believed his death was &quot;imminent,&quot; but was scheduled because his doctor attested that he might not survive for more than six months.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a nurse practitioner, her insurer, the clinic she owned and operated, and the Louisiana Patients' Compensation Fund (PCF), sought review of an order from the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana), which held that the cap enunciated in the Louisiana Medical Malpractice Act (MMA), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42(B), was unconstitutional to the extent it included nurse practitioners within its ambit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents brought a medical malpractice action against petitioners, claiming that the nurse's delayed diagnosis and treatment of their child caused the severity of her injuries. The trial court reduced the jury's award in favor of the parents to comply with &sect; 40:1299.42(B). The court of appeals reversed the trial court's judgment and held that the cap in &sect; 40:1299.42(B) was unconstitutional to the extent it included nurse practitioners within its ambit. On review, the court held that the cap in &sect; 40:1299.42(B) was constitutional and applied to all health care providers under the MMA, including nurse practitioners. The court of appeals did not err in upholding an award of pretrial medical and related benefits outside of those awarded by the jury. Including the word &quot;past&quot; in the judgment did not result in a double recovery for the parents. Rather, the term merely reiterated what was already contemplated in the definition of &quot;future medical care and related benefits&quot; in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.43(B)(1)(a) and (b). The court of appeals did not err in upholding an award of judicial interest to the parents on past medical expenses paid by Medicaid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals with regard to its holding that &sect; 40:1299.42(B), was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal held that the taxpayer and all other tobacco dealers were not liable for the tobacco tax on smokeless tobacco products under the provisions of the Tobacco Tax Law. It held the other issues surrounding the interpretation of the invoice price and the constitutionality of the definition of invoice price were moot given its determination that the taxpayer was not liable for the tax. However, the court of appeal erred in its determination. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 47:841 and 47:854 imposed an excise tax of 20 percent on smokeless tobacco products to be paid by the dealer who first sold, used, consumed, handled, or distributed the product in Louisiana. The statutory wording and the intent of the legislature were clear, yet the legislature did not correctly draft and amend all the necessary sections of the statutory scheme to reflect that intent. Because the language and intent of both statutes was clear, the statutes were read to impose an excise tax on smokeless tobacco products. Because the finding that the taxpayer did not owe the excise tax was reversed, remand was necessary to consider the two pretermitted issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in permitting the withdrawal of his motion for new trial without first appointing a sanity commission to determine defendant's competence under La.

Defendant did not show the existence of any mental disease or defect that could diminish his capacity to understand the proceedings against him or assist in his defense. Defendant's answers were articulate, cogent, and indicated that he fully comprehended the rights he was foregoing, and the gravity of withdrawing the motion. Because the trial court's interview established that defendant clearly had the capacity to understand the proceedings against him and to assist in his defense, the trial court did not err in failing to appoint a sanity commission to determine defendant's competence. Defendant also failed to demonstrate that counsel labored under an actual conflict of interest under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff family filed a negligence action against defendants, a city, a police department, the chief and certain police officers, and two insurers. The trial court granted the city's request for a jury trial, finding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5105(D) permitted the city to waive the prohibition against jury trials on a case-by-case basis. The Court of Appeal, Fifth Circuit, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), reversed. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family alleged that police officers falsely arrested the decedent, subjecting her to unnecessary force and battery, and improperly left decedent unattended in a police car, where she died. The family's petition requested trial by jury, but the family later moved to strike the jury demand. The following day, the city council enacted a resolution, pursuant to &sect; 13:5105(D), waiving the prohibition against jury trials in this specific case and filed a request for a jury trial. The court of appeals held that the resolution was a prohibited special law because it waived the prohibition against jury trials only in this single case. The supreme court, applying different reasoning, found that the plain language of &sect; 13:5105(D) did not permit a political subdivision to waive the prohibition against jury trials in a single case. Furthermore, the political subdivision's insurer was not entitled to trial by jury where the political subdivision had not waived the prohibition, and the insurer's liability was vicarious, not independent. Therefore, in suits against a political subdivision and its insurer where there were no other nongovernmental defendants, a bifurcated trial was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for second degree murder; he waived his right to trial by jury. However, the State objected, noting that under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, the defendant was required to make the waiver 45 days prior to the trial date. The 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), found that defendant could waive a jury trial at any time before trial and that the time limit was unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the district court could not refuse to enforce a law on the grounds that the district court on its own motion found the law unconstitutional. The district judge lacked standing to raise a constitutional challenge to the laws the judge was charged by judicial oath to enforce. The district court owed an equal duty to apply and enforce a presumptively constitutional legislative act as it did the state constitution. The district court therefore erred in declaring that the jury waiver procedure described in La. Const. art. I, &sect; 17(A) was unconstitutional without the issue being properly raised by the parties. Additionally, because the parties did not themselves raise and brief the issue, the record was not fully developed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. The State filed notice under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant opposed the State's notice just before jury election was to begin. The State notified the trial court that the analyst who conducted the testing worked for a crime lab located in another parish and was not immediately available. The trial court denied defendant's objection as untimely. The court of appeal ruled that introduction of the crime lab report, as opposed to presenting live testimony from the analyst, violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. The supreme court held that the trial court properly admitted the analyst's certificate in lieu of the analyst's live testimony under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:500. Defendant waived his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation by failing to timely request a subpoena for the analyst who performed the test on the rocks of cocaine. States remained free to impose reasonable restrictions on a defendant's assertion of his or her confrontation rights. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to issue an instanter subpoena for the out-of-parish criminalist at the risk of delaying a one-day trial after defendant failed to timely request that a subpoena issue for the witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a class action, the district court granted summary judgment to plaintiff insureds for penalties provided by former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:658(A)(3) arising out of defendant insurer's failure to timely initiate loss adjustment on the enumerated class members' insurance claims. The insurer appealed. The Court of Appeal, Fifth Circuit, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), reversed. The insureds appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal held that a factual determination of whether the insurer breached its duty of good faith was required before assessing penalties under &sect; 22:658(A)(3). The supreme court granted the writ of certiorari to resolve a split in the circuits regarding the proof necessary to award penalties for failure to timely initiate loss adjustment under &sect; 22:658(A)(3) and, correspondingly, former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1220(C). The plain language of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:2658(A)(3) did not require a showing of bad faith by the insurer, but simply required proof of notice and inaction for over 30 days. Therefore, because no genuine issue of material fact existed regarding whether the insurer timely initiated loss adjustment, summary judgment in favor of the insureds was appropriate. Furthermore, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1220(C) capped the penalties for such inaction at five thousand dollars when damages were not proven. Accordingly, the district court did not err in awarding each individual insured five thousand dollars in statutory penalties, subject to a credit in the insurer's favor for those insureds who executed binding releases or opted out of the class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Fourth District Court for the Parish of Ouacita, Louisiana, that convicted him of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted first-degree murder and that imposed the death penalty, arguing that the trial court erred in granting the State's challenge for cause to a juror who was against the death penalty and in admitting into evidence during the penalty phase letters he wrote while in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a domestic dispute, defendant shot his wife, his mother-in-law, and his stepdaughter; only his stepdaughter survived. On review, the court held that the juror was properly excused for cause under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 798 on the basis that she was unable to consider rendering a death verdict. The juror clearly stated that she would automatically vote for a life sentence if defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder and would not consider the possibility of the death sentence because that she believed a life sentence would cause defendant to suffer more. Further, letters in which defendant implicitly admitted to shooting his stepdaughter and expressed a desire to escape from jail and &quot;finish the job&quot; or to hire a hitman to do so were relevant and admissible under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.2 in the penalty phase of trial to prove defendant's character. Despite the fact that there was no evidence that defendant took any steps, beyond mailing the letters, to carry out the plans described, defendant's statements in both letters were directly relevant to the defendant's character and violent propensities, even while confined by the prison walls.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant failed to appear at an arraignment, the State requested that an arrest warrant be issued pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 496. The warrant was issued and an indigent defender subsequently challenged its issuance and the constitutionality of art. 496. The Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) found the article unconstitutional and recalled the warrant. The State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although defendant eventually appeared in court and the State entered a nolle prosequi, the issue was ripe for review, the matter was capable of repetition, yet evaded review, and the appeal presented a justiciable question. In the indigent defender's written motion, the district court was asked to deny the State's request for the arrest warrant absent a judicial determination of probable cause. The district court erred in declaring art. 496 unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amends. IV and XIV, and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 because the district court could have instead adopted a narrowing construction of the article. Although art. 496 did not expressly require a judicial determination of probable cause before a warrant was issued, the general requirements for issuing an arrest warrant under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 202 applied. Articles 202 and 496 should have been read in pari materia, such that an arrest warrant could have issued upon the basis of a bill of information only if an affidavit filed with the information showed probable cause for the arrest. Accordingly, art. 496 was constitutional under the narrow construction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 3-18 prohibited the Sunday sale of alcoholic beverages.

However, the Police Jury had authority under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:493 to regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages. Red River Parish, La. Code &sect; 3-18 was valid. The Police Jury had the power under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:493 to regulate the sale of alcohol, even if the sale occurred on Sundays. To the extent Red River Parish, La. Code &sect; 3-18 was impacted by both La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 26:493 and 51:191, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:493 was the more specific statute, and thus controlling.

Defendant was the assistant chief of police, an authoritative figure, and the request was made in the bedroom of a transvestite who was present and who also made lewd requests of the victim. If the victim had acquiesced in this intimidating environment, the crime would have completed. A rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's conduct constituted attempt to commit indecent behavior with a juvenile. In reviewing the evidence and the totality of the facts and circumstances, a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed an act for the purpose of and tending directly toward the accomplishing of indecent behavior with a juvenile. While most other crimes required an overt physical act in order for an attempt to occur, the completed crime of indecent behavior with a juvenile was accomplished by the mere communication of lewd or lascivious conduct, text, or images.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In five consolidated criminal cases involving convicted sex offenders, defendants underwent the Sex Offender Assessment Panel (SOAP) process under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:560 et seq. Following a hearing, the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) declared La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:560 et seq.&nbsp;unconstitutional. The State filed a motion for direct appeal pursuant to La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:560 et seq. to be unconstitutionally vague, and held that the statutory definitions of &quot;child sexual predator&quot; (CSP), &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; (SVP), and &quot;mental abnormality&quot; were circular and insufficient guideposts for both the offenders and panel members. Additionally, the district court concluded that the penalties imposed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:560.3 were deprivations to the offender's liberty and property that had to meet the requirements of due process at both the panel hearings and court hearings. However, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:560 et seq. was a regulatory, rather than criminal statutory scheme, and, therefore, was not subject to a void for vagueness analysis. Further, even applying a due process analysis, the SOAP statutory scheme did not violate due process. The SOAP statutory scheme provided offenders with notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard at a court hearing to determine SVP or CSP status. Finally, the statutory definitions were constitutionally sufficient to allow the panel to make its recommendation and the court to make a determination of SVP or CSP status.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court reversed the appellate court's determination and found that while &sect; 9:355.12 mandated that the trial court consider all 12 factors listed, its failure to expressly each factor in its written or oral reasons did not constitute an error of law such that de novo review was appropriate. Where the trial court had considered the factors listed under &sect; 9:355.12 in determining whether relocation was in the best interest of the child or children, that determination was reviewed for abuse of discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed under La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(D), from an order of the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, for the Parish of Livingston (Louisiana), convicting him, upon a jury's verdict, of first-degree murder, and sentencing him to death, after finding an aggravating circumstance under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.4, that the victim was a peace officer engaged in his lawful duties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an arrest following an armed bank robbery, defendant pulled a gun from his waist and shot and killed a sheriff's deputy. Defendant's motion to suppress his statement was properly denied because defendant failed to show that he did not make a knowing and intelligent waiver or that he was under the influence of fear and duress sufficient to vitiate voluntariness. Further, defendant failed to show that the pretrial publicity colored the jurors' voir dire responses to the point of making them unreliable or that any of the challenged jurors could not have rendered an impartial verdict based upon the law and evidence. Next, security concerns specifically related to defendant were sufficient to support the trial court's determination that the shackling of defendant was necessary during the trial. There was evidence before the court that the warden had learned that defendant and other inmates had formulated an escape plan and a shank was found in the cell of one of the inmates. With regard to the penalty phase, the court could not tell from the record the extent, if any, of counsel's investigation for mitigating evidence. Thus, remand for an evidentiary hearing was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's first-degree murder conviction and conditionally affirmed the imposition of the death sentence, remanding to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on whether defendant received effective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase of the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, receivers of health maintenance organizations (HMOs), sued defendant, the HMOs' seller, on a guarantee and for various tort claims. The trial court and a jury awarded the receivers compensatory and punitive damages. The Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) affirmed a reduction of damages for breach of the guarantee and reversed the judgments on the tort claims. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The receivers, three states' HMO regulators, contested how the seller sold the HMOs. The supreme court held damages for breach of a guarantee were properly reduced because it only promised to fund an HMO for the minimum required by former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:2010. A breach of fiduciary duty charge was proper because (1) no instruction on former Tex. Bus. Corp. Act art. 2.21 was needed, as no shareholder was sought to be held liable for corporate acts, (2) the HMOs' directors would likely be held to owe the HMOs a fiduciary duty, and (3) the directors could be liable under Tex. Ins. Code Ann. &sect; 843.401. A fraud charge did not fatally err because (1) former Tex. Bus. Corp. Act art. 2.21 did not apply to the seller's pre-sale acts, (2) it correctly instructed on fraud by deception, and (3) error in stating traditional fraud elements did not mislead the jury. It was proper to instruct on deceptive acts in insurance, under former Tex. Ins. Code art. 21.21, because the statute applied to the seller. A civil conspiracy charge was not defective because it did not let jurors eliminate intentional or knowing elements and required a finding of an underlying unlawful act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal's ruling on the guarantee was affirmed, but its rulings on tort claims were reversed, and the verdict and trial court judgment were reinstated, as were compensatory and punitive damages awards. The trial court's ruling on two receivers' attorneys fees and punitive damages claims was affirmed. Its ruling reducing the seller's fault percentage was reversed. Its ruling allocating costs was reinstated and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with false swearing for purposes of violating public health or safety in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:126.1. He filed a motion to quash the bill of information, contending that &sect; 14:126.1 was unconstitutionally vague. The motion was denied. The State challenged an order of the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit (Louisiana), which set aside that ruling and ordered the prosecution quashed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals read the title of the statute, which referred to &quot;false swearing,&quot; into the body of the law. It ruled that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:126 and &sect; 14:126.1 operated in tandem, and consequently, had to be read in para materia to require in the latter case that the offender make the alleged false statement under oath or an equivalent affirmation. The supreme court held that &sect; 14:126.1 did not require that the offender make the alleged false statement under oath or equivalent affirmation. Removing the title of &sect; 14:126.1 as an interpretative guide to the language of the text cured any vagueness that could arise from using the term &quot;false swearing&quot; to describe the making or communicating of &quot;false statements.&quot; The court of appeal erred in its analysis because &sect; 14:126.1 did not form part of the comprehensive set of criminal laws adopted by the legislature in the Criminal Code of 1942, 1942 La. Acts 43, and which set out the crimes of perjury and false swearing, including the parallel provisions that addressed the evidentiary import of the making of subsequent statements inconsistent with a statement made under oath or equivalent affirmation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the decision and remanded the case to the court of appeal to address the defendant's other assignments of error.</SPAN></P>

The property owners were putative members of a class action who were excluded by a later class restriction. Pursuant to La. Code. Civ. Proc. art. 596, the liberative prescription that was suspended with the filing of the class action petition, commenced to run again 30 days after publication of notice of the class restriction. Since notice was provided on April 24, 2008, then, the suspended period ended on May 24, 2008, and the prescription commenced to run anew.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Electors in Ward 3 of the parish voted to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages in the ward pursuant to a local-option election. Ward 8, in contrast, voted to permit the sale of alcoholic beverages. Years later, the parish adopted a home-rule charter, replacing its police-jury system with a parish council. The council district comprised parts of Wards 3 and 8. The owner's convenience store was located in a portion of Ward 3 contained in the council district. The population classification contained in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:583(C)(2) persuaded the appellate court that it was not prohibited as a local law in violation of La. Const. art. III, &sect; 12(A). Further, although &sect; 26:583(C)(2) had characteristics of a special law, it was not aimed at special interests and affected parish residents generally, not business owners specifically. Finally, &sect; 26:583(C)(2) did not violate the owner's equal protection rights pursuant to La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3 because the amendment did not classify individuals; rather, it classified parishes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion for random allotment, challenging the method by which non-capital felony criminal cases were assigned in the Fifteenth Judicial District. The State sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana), which reversed an order denying the motion and found that the system for allocating non-capital criminal cases violated La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the local rules at issue did not offend the uniform rules of allotment, statutes, or the constitutional rights due to a criminal defendant. The plan did not violate La. Dist. Ct. app. 3, R. 14.0. A majority of the Fifteenth Judicial District judges adopted the plan as provided in La. Dist. Ct. app. 14.0A. The judges were not in error in taking into account considerations of judicial efficiency and costs in developing the plan, as long as their method of case allotment did not otherwise violate the law. The so-called &quot;geographical assignments&quot; were only for the first two years of the plan's operation. Thereafter, the judges wold be assigned to the tracks district-wide on a random basis. The plan did not violate the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:502. The supreme court provided a framework in the uniform rules whereby individual judicial districts could develop a plan to randomly allot cases in a way that worked best for that district. The plan did not create a specialized criminal court. It merely provided a mechanism whereby the non-capital criminal cases were allotted to particular divisions within the district court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with simple criminal damage to property. Under La. Rev. Stat.

After entering a plea of not guilty, he sought to declare &sect; 13:1347&nbsp;unconstitutional. Defendant's motion was denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because they were not elected judges, the commissioners of the magistrate section of the criminal district court could not exercise the adjudicatory power of the State to dispose of misdemeanor cases by accepting guilty pleas or conducting trials. Furthermore, &sect; 13:1347 did not grant to the nonelected commissioners the same adjudicatory powers of the elected magistrate judges of the criminal district court. Consequently, the criminal district court's practice of allotting misdemeanor criminal cases to the commissioners of the magistrate section of the court for accepting guilty pleas and conducting trials, violated La. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 1 and 22. Accordingly, the scope of &sect; 13:1347 was clarified in conformity with the state constitution to provide that the commissioners of the magistrate section of the criminal district court could not conduct trials or accept guilty pleas in misdemeanor case because they were not elected judges and the commissioners could not lawfully exercise the adjudicatory power of the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), a tax assessor challenged the constitutionality of the Louisiana Tax Commission's (LTC) administration of ad valorem taxes assessed against public service property. The assessor challenged the LTC's application of the tax valuation methodology set forth in La. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 18(D), 21(F),  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 47:1853,  47:1854,  47:2321.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The LTC sought to determine the value of a company's public service property that was subject to taxation in the parish by subtracting the book value of the company's tax exempt property from the fair market value of the company's property that was subject to taxation by the parish and its various taxing and tax-recipient bodies. The substantive right at issue was the right to challenge the application of the relevant laws governing the tax valuation of public service properties. The legislature under the clear and explicit language of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1856(G) granted the right to bring an as applied challenge regarding the tax valuation of public service property solely to the public service taxpayer, and not to the assessor. Further, the assessor did not have authority to challenge the special provisions governing the assessment of public service properties under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1998(C). Therefore, because the petition failed to disclose a right of action in the assessor, the peremptory exception of no right of action was properly noticed and sustained by the court under the authority of La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 927.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ and rendered judgment sustaining the peremptory exception of no right of action noticed on the court's own motion and dismissing the assessor's petition with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which convicted him of first-degree murder in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The supreme court affirmed, stating that he was not deprived of his fundamental right to present a defense under U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV, and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. Nothing in the record suggested that defendant's homicidal actions were the result of immediate provocation sufficient to deprive an average person of his self-control and cool reflection. Under those circumstances, defendant failed to carry his burden of proof that such evidence was even relevant much less mitigating under La. Code Evid. Ann. arts. 402 and 403. Thus, there was no abuse of the district court's discretion in granting the State's motion in limine and the district court did not deprive defendant of his fundamental right to present a defense. Defendant's death sentence was proper because he subjected the victim to the pitiless infliction of unnecessary pain prior to death. The serious physical, mental, and emotional abuse that the victim had to have suffered moments before death amounted to torture and defendant carried out the death in a particularly inhumane manner.</SPAN></P>

The mortgagee did not receive notice of the delinquent taxes nor notice of the pending sale. The trial court found notice of the pending sale provided to an employee of the owners' corporation was inadequate notice to the individual property owners and that the lack of proper notice to the owners and mortgagee constituted a due process violation under both federal and state constitutions. The city argued that the notice given to the employee at the property location was proper and that it was not required to send notice to the mortgagee because the bank failed to request notice pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2180.1. The court held that the court of appeal erred because it did not review the judgment under the manifest error standard of review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death by a jury in the trial court. The conviction was affirmed by the court on appeal. The United States Supreme Court granted defendant's writ application to consider whether a confession letter was improperly admitted. The Court overruled Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U.S. 625, 89 L.Ed.2d 631 (1986), and remanded the case for consideration of further issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While being taken by officers to locate evidence, defendant wrote a letter of apology and confession to the murder victim's wife in which he described details of the crime. Because the motion to suppress was made on the basis of Jackson, the United States Supreme Court held that defendant should be given a chance to contend that letter should have been suppressed under the rule of Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981), under which a defendant in custody could not be interrogated once he asserted a right to counsel unless he initiated further communications. The court held that defendant's arguments for exclusion of the letter were precluded because he did not raise them at the trial court in a motion to suppress. He failed to argue that he made a clear assertion of his right to counsel on the day of the letter such that the protections of Edwards would apply, or that his subsequent waiver was invalid because it was based on misrepresentations by police, as grounds for suppressing the evidence in the district court. His trial testimony came too late to affect the admissibility of the letter. In addition, admission of the letter was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reaffirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant, a contractor's employee, brought an action for damages against respondent principal employer after the employee was injured at work. The trial court denied the employer's affirmative defense of immunity as a statutory employer under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1061. The Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of Iberville (Louisiana), reversed the trial court's judgment. The employee's application for writ of certiorari was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Preliminarily, the employee's argument that the state constitution required a majority of the full complement of the appellate court to concur to render judgment was rejected. The plain and unambiguous language of La. Const. art. V, &sect; 8 required only a majority of the judges sitting to concur to render the judgment. The en banc composition in the instant case consisted of eleven judges as one judge was recused. Thus, six judges concurring in the judgment composed a constitutional majority. With regard to the employer's affirmative defense, a contract addendum was valid and effective to create a statutory employment relationship between the employee and the principal employer under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1061, although the principal's representative affixed a typewritten signature and there was insufficient evidence to determine if the signature was authorized, because the addendum was prepared by the principal and signed by the contractor's authorized representative. The party that prepared the contract and proposed its terms was bound even if its signature was missing. Accordingly, the principal was a statutory employer entitled to tort immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff interstate gas pipeline companies brought an action against defendants, the Louisiana Tax Commission and various local sheriffs and assessors, challenging an ad valorem tax scheme, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1851(K), (M), as unconstitutional. The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the companies.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The interstate companies all paid their ad valorem taxes under protest for the years in dispute and brought actions, which were consolidated. The companies alleged that the ad valorem tax scheme was violative of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, in that it imposed a greater tax burden on interstate companies than it did upon intrastate companies. Under the tax scheme, all interstate companies were classified as &quot;public service property&quot; subject to a 25 percent ad valorem tax, while some intrastate companies were classified as &quot;other property&quot; subject to a 15 percent tax. The higher tax assessment was not based on whether the company was engaged in intrastate or interstate commerce, but on whether the company was rate-regulated or non rate-regulated. Accordingly, the tax scheme was not discriminatory on its face, and the court of appeal erred in so finding. Moreover, the interstate companies failed to meet their burden of proving that the tax scheme burdened interstate commerce because they failed to show that the differential treatment caused by the tax scheme's classifications somehow benefited intrastate companies at the expense of interstate companies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owner's car was seized pursuant to the Seizure and Controlled Dangerous Substances Property Forfeiture Act of 1989 (the Act), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2601 et seq. The trial court denied the State's motion to strike a notice of claim filed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2610. The Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of Lafourche (Louisiana), denied the State's writ application. The State's petition for supervisory writ was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State complied with the requirements for commencing a forfeiture proceeding under the Act. The parish drug task force properly followed the requirements for seizing the vehicle. The district attorney ensured that the owner was personally served with a Notice of Pending Service, which contained all the information required by statute. Finally, the State chose to make available a stipulation of exemption. Upon receipt of the service of the Notice of Pending Forfeiture, the owner attempted to comply with the requirements of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:2609-10, but failed to do so. The owner's claim did not contain the delineated averments, with the requisite specificity, to qualify as a valid claim under &sect; 2610. The owner's failure to provide the essential and specific factual and legal assertions to support all of the necessary averments rendered his claim invalid under &sect; 2610. The owner's constitutional challenge of the Act was likewise deficient and had no effect on the validity of the claim. The owner failed to provide any factual or legal support for his arguments that the seizure of his property was unconstitutional, that the Act as a whole was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court to allow that court to determine, based solely on the submissions filed by the State, whether the court has jurisdiction, whether the State's Notice of Pending Forfeiture gave sufficient notice under the Act, and whether the facts averred to and provided by the State were sufficient to show probable cause for forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

Child. Code Ann. art. 882, which denied juveniles the right to a jury trial in juvenile adjudications, violated the United States and Louisiana Constitutions where the juvenile was subject to a potential deprivation of liberty of more than six months. Appellant State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was charged with committing six aggravated rapes upon his younger siblings. He was not entitled to a jury trial under La. Child. Code Ann. art. 882 even though the potential penalty involved a deprivation of liberty that was greater than six months. The juvenile court erred in holding that art. 882 was unconstitutional because the ruling was contrary to controlling precedent from the United States Supreme Court. It also erred by not affording art. 882 the presumption of constitutionality. The lack of jury trials in juvenile adjudications did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VI or La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17 because a juvenile court proceeding was not a criminal prosecution. Due process was not violated under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2, because fundamental fairness did not require the State to provide a jury in a juvenile delinquency proceeding. Equal protection, U.S. Const. amend. XIV and La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3, did not provide for a right to trial by jury in juvenile adjudications because juvenile courts were legitimately distinct from adult criminal courts. Further, there was a rational basis for treating juveniles differently from adults.</SPAN></P>

Defendant failed to take any action to indicate that he did not acquiesce in the judgment and sentence. Also, defendant failed to take any action demonstrating his objection to the conviction and sentence prior to his payment of the fine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that &sect; 40:966(E)(2) improperly allowed the State to use a prior misdemeanor conviction of possession of marijuana, first offense, obtained in a proceeding in which there was no right to trial by jury, to increase the statutory maximum penalty available for a second offense possession of marijuana. The appellate court, however, held that U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV did not preclude the sentence-enhancing use of the prior valid, fair, and reliable conviction of a misdemeanor, obtained against an adult, where the misdemeanor proceeding included all the constitutional protections applicable to such proceedings, even though those protections did not include the right to trial by jury. The statutory scheme of increased punishment for recidivist marijuana possession satisfied the requirement of due process because under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, states were allowed the presumption that in petty crimes and offenses, trial judges were capable of reliable fact finding. Accordingly, &sect; 40:966(E)(2) did not suffer from a constitutional infirmity.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 230.2. The Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans, denied relief. Defendant filed a writ of certiorari with the instant court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested without a warrant at 12:04 p.m. on Monday, June 8, 2009, for possession of cocaine; he was booked at 4:35 a.m. on June 9. Defendant appeared before a magistrate at 3 p.m. on June 9, but a probable cause determination was not made until he appeared before the magistrate on June 11. Because the probable cause determination was not made within 48 hours of defendant's arrest, his attorney moved for defendant's release pursuant to Article 230.2. The request was denied. On review, the court reversed, holding that because defendant did not receive the required probable cause determination within 48 hours of his arrest as required by the Fourth Amendment and Article 230.2, he was entitled to immediate release on his own recognizance. The court held that probable cause required under Article 230.2 was not determined at the time of arrest, as the Fourth Amendment required a judicial determination of probable cause when a person was arrested without a warrant. The time began to run when defendant was arrested and the determination could not be delayed to collect additional evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by a store security officer for shoplifting and was directed to return to the store to speak with a police officer who was on-site. Defendant scuffled with the officer, gained possession of her firearm, and fired numerous shots. He shot and killed the officer and wounded the security officer and a bystander who tried to assist in subduing defendant.  On review, the court held that the evidence failed to show that defendant was insane under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:14 because the evidence reasonably supported the jury's finding that defendant could distinguish between right and wrong and was not insane where the record showed that no one stood between defendant and the exit, that several people told defendant to simply leave and not shoot, and that defendant instead aimed and fired at each of the three victims twice. Defendant exhibited full appreciation that the actions he had just taken were so serious that the only course left to him was escape. Further, the imposition of a capital sentence was not disproportionate to the severity of the offense under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.9 and La. Sup. Ct. R. 28.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the mother and sister of a deceased patient, brought suit against defendant medical providers. A second sister sought to join as plaintiff, and the providers filed an exception of prescription.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient died, allegedly as a result of the providers' failure to diagnose and treat a heart attack. At the time the second sister joined the suit, the action had prescribed. The district court held that under the doctrine of relation back in La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1153, and because her survival claim was the same as her mother's and sister's, the second sister's claim could proceed. The court held that article 1153 did not apply to this malpractice action because medical malpractice actions were governed by the specific provisions of the Medical Malpractice Act regarding prescription and suspension of prescription. Any general codal article which conflicted with these provisions may not be applied to such actions. The Act had no rules allowing relation back of pleadings for medical malpractice claims. The application of article 1153 would permit the adding of an plaintiff subsequent to the expiration of the three-year period provided for in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628, and would effectively read out of the statute the prescription and suspension period provisions in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628 and La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated its decision on original hearing, reversed the judgment of the court of appeal, and ordered that the case be remanded to the district court to grant defendants' exception of prescription.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tax recipient filed a petition seeking review of the 2007 tax assessment and valuation for public service properties belonging to defendants, owners. The owners and defendant Louisiana Tax Commission (LTC) filed declinatory exceptions of lack of subject matter jurisdiction, which were granted by the district court. The Court of Appeals, First Circuit, Parish of East Baton, Louisiana, reversed. Review was granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The LTC assessment, centrally valued and assessed all the owners' properties in Louisiana as of January 1, 2007, and then allocated that value among the various parishes in which the properties were located. The owners paid the ad valorem taxes without protest. The recipient challenged the assessment by the LTC. The question was whether the recipient's petition sought to challenge the correctness of the assessment at issue or the legality of it. The reviewing court ruled that the recipient sought review of the correctness of the LTC's assessment, and the district court did not have original jurisdiction over the claim. The recipient expressly and repeatedly stated he was challenging the value placed on the owners' properties by the LTC, that he challenged the method the LTC used to arrive at value, and that his prayer was for a correction of value. The recipient sought to correct the value the LTC placed on the owners' taxable properties, to correct the value the LTC placed on the owners' tax exempt properties, and to increase the percentage of the value allocated to the parish. The recipient did not seek to attack the assessment as having no legal existence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for vehicular homicide. She filed a motion to suppress her oral statements made at the scene of a fatal, one-car accident in which the passenger was killed after defendant lost control of her car; defendant also sought to suppress the blood-alcohol test. Defendant's motion to suppress was granted, and the State sought review. The First Circuit Court of Appeal, Iberville Parish, Louisiana, affirmed. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State contended defendant's statement that she had been drinking alcohol should not have been suppressed, and defendant had no basis for moving to suppress the results of the blood-alcohol test. The supreme court agreed in part, finding that when the trial court considered whether defendant was under arrest or detained when she made her statement to the officer and whether her statement that she consumed alcoholic beverages was admissible, it should have taken into consideration the chief's testimony, including the portion drawn from the officer's police report, when it ruled on defendant's motion to suppress. Further, Miranda warnings were not required because defendant was not in custody. Therefore, the trial court erred when it suppressed defendant's statements at the accident scene. However, suppression of the blood alcohol test results was proper as the State provided no testimony that a qualified person drew defendant's blood sample. Insofar as defendant's test results were sought to be used by the State as presumptive evidence of her guilt, theyh were inadmissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's ruling was reversed to the extent it suppressed defendant's statements made at the scene of the vehicular accident; in all other respects, the State's writ application was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Parish of Natchitoches, after a lower court denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence the State seized purportedly pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum as provided in La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 66, a divided panel of the court of appeal denied defendant's writ. The instant court granted defendant's writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating La. Rev. Stat. 40:971B(l)(i), obtaining a prescription for a controlled dangerous substance from a health care practitioner without disclosing the fact of an existing prescription for a controlled dangerous substance from another health care practitioner, i.e., doctor shopping. Defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in her medical and prescription records such that a warrant was required for a search and seizure of these records for criminal investigative purposes. Because a warrant was required, the trial court erred in finding the remedy was for the State to comply with requirements of La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 66 and La. Rev. Stat. 13:3715.1, which the State had admittedly failed to comply with in obtaining defendant's prescription and medical records, in order for these records to be admissible at trial. Because the Fourth Amendment and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 required a search warrant before a search of prescription and medical records for criminal investigative purposes was permitted, the State could not cure its warrantless search and seizure of the records by a second subpoena of these records.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the first-degree murder of a four-year-old girl and received a death sentence. His first trial ended in a mistrial. The supreme court affirmed, stating that defendant was not constitutionally entitled to the counsel of his choice under U.S. Const. amend. VI and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Moreover, the district court anticipated that the appointment of qualified local counsel would facilitate prompt resolution of future funding and other questions that would arise in connection with defendant's retrial. There was seemingly insoluble funding issues that plagued the judicial district at that time and appointing local counsel allowed the district court to quickly set hearings for questions that arose pretrial. The supreme court also found that there was nothing constitutionally that supported the defense's argument that a criminal defendant had a right to a particular attorney-client relationship in the absence of a right to counsel of choice. Defendant's death sentence was appropriate under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The victim was under the age of 12 years, thus establishing an aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent attorneys and the Louisiana Office of Disciplinary Counsel filed objections to the Louisiana State Bar Disciplinary Board's recommendation based upon the attorneys' violation of La. Sup. Ct. R. XIX, &sect; 16, arguing that the confidentiality requirement imposed by the rule violated their rights under the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In civil litigation, the attorneys revealed information they gained about an adversary through in attorney disciplinary proceedings. A grievance was filed against them for violating the confidentiality rule of La. Sup. Ct. R. XIX, &sect; 16(A) and (I), which prohibited participants in attorney disciplinary proceedings from disclosing any information about such proceedings. In reviewing the recommendation of the Disciplinary Board, the court agreed with the attorneys and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel that the confidentiality rule violated the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I. The confidentiality rule directly abridged speech and was a content-based regulation; as such, it could only be deemed constitutional if it satisfied the requirements of strict scrutiny. While the reputational interests of attorneys were important, they did not qualify as compelling under strict scrutiny. Accordingly, the confidentiality requirement imposed upon participants in attorney disciplinary proceedings under La. Sup. Ct. R. XIX, &sect; 16(A) and (I) was unconstitutional and could not be enforced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the confidential provisions of La. Sup. Ct. R. XIX, &sect; 16, constituted an impermissible content-based restriction of speech and thus violated the First Amendment. As such, the charges against the attorneys for violating this unconstitutional rule were dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner applied to the parish for a permit to sell alcoholic beverages at his saloon. Pursuant to Tangipahoa Parish, La. Ordinance No. 07-39, &sect; 5-38(b) and (c), he was required to obtain the written, notarized consent of all adjacent property owners. One of his five neighbors refused to consent. The owner argued that the ordinance constituted an impermissible zoning law when the parish had no zoning regulation in place. The court held that the owner failed to specially plead his constitutional challenge and failed to particularize the grounds of his claim. Even at the hearing, the owner did not specify any particular provisions of the constitution which he believed the ordinance violated. The court could not determine from the record whether the owner satisfied his burden of identifying a particular constitutional provision that limited the power of the parish to enact the ordinance. Further, the district court was required to make a specific determination that the constitutional issue was essential to the resolution of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the trial court's finding that the ordinance were unconstitutional was premature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a state retiree, brought a declaratory judgment action against defendant, the Board of Trustees of the Louisiana State Employees Retirement System, in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court of the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana). The retiree challenged the constitutionality of 2002 1st Ex. Sess. La. Acts No. 165 (Act 165). The district court granted summary judgment to the employee, and the trustees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Act 165 amended La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:416, part of the Louisiana State Employees Retirement System, to provide for the reemployment of retirees and to provide for the benefits paid to such retirees. The retiree, who retired before the enactment of Act 165, was unable to participate. She argued, and the district court agreed, that Act 165 was unconstitutional because it did not comply with the notice and publication requirements of La. Const. art. X, &sect; 29(C) (1974). The court held that art. X, &sect; 29(C) applied only to bills introduced in regular sessions of the legislature and did not apply to bills introduced in an extraordinary session. Because Act 165 was introduced and enacted during an extraordinary session, it was subject only to the specific and clear notice provisions of La. Const. art. III, &sect; 2(B) (1974). Contrary to the retiree's allegations, the governor's authority under past constitutions to convene an extraordinary session was not limited to a public emergency, but to a time frame, which could not exceed thirty days, and to the objects specially enumerated in the proclamation convening the extraordinary session. Therefore, the rationale of older cases remained valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court granting the retiree's motion for summary judgment and declaring Act 165 unconstitutional, null, void, and unenforceable. Finding that there were no disputed issues of material fact, and that the trustees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the court granted summary judgment to the trustees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction and death-sentence for first-degree murder, but the supreme court affirmed, stating that the trial court did not err in ruling that defendant had the mental capacity to stand trial under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 641. In part, although a letter written by defendant to the district attorney suggested that defendant might not have understood the legal subtleties relative to the law regarding principals, in no way did it demonstrate that she could not assist counsel in her defense. Members of the sanity commission unanimously opined that defendant was competent and even a doctor, whose testimony defendant primarily relied upon in support of the claim and who admitted he did not examine her to determine competency, testified that she understood her rights and was able to communicate with her attorneys. Further, evidence relating to defendant's boyfriend's criminal punishment for his role in the offense was irrelevant and could have very well diverted the jury from the task before it; namely, the character and propensities of defendant. Defendant also failed to establish any basis for the suppression of her multiple statements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the rape of an 8-year old child. He filed a motion seeking access to videotaped interviews of the child victim and also a child witness, age 12, so that his expert could assess the two children. The trial court denied the motion, but the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal (Louisiana) reversed, allowing defendant's expert to view the videotapes. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the victim and eyewitness were children, they were protected persons under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:440.2(C). Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:440.5(C), if defendant's attorney was provided a copy of the videotaped statement, only the attorney and the defendant could view the tape, and no copies could be made by any person. Defendant argued that this language should be interpreted broadly to allow a defense expert to review the videotape as an agent of the attorney, because any additional intrusion on the privacy interests of the protected person was minimal. The court held that the clear language of &sect; 14:440.5(C) stated that only the defense attorney and the defendant could view the tape, and recent amendments made it clear that the legislature did not intend any expansive interpretation of that language. Defendant's right to confrontation was not violated because the victim and witness were available to testify at trial, and counsel could presumably cross examine them without expert assistance. Similarly, his due process right to present a defense was not violated, because it provided no greater rights than his right to confrontation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal granting defendant's expert access to videotaped interviews with a child victim and a child witness and reinstated the decision of the Juvenile Parish Court for the Parish of Orleans denying defendant's motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant contended that requiring the onset of retardation prior to age 18 was arbitrary, and that the defendant was not competent to stand trial. The defendant also argued that he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to remain silent, that jurors were improperly challenged peremptorily based on race and selected based on pro-death attitudes, and the evidence did not support the aggravating factor of murder in a heinous or cruel manner. The Supreme Court of Louisiana held, however, that the defendant was properly convicted and sentenced. Any arbitrariness in the definition of mental retardation was irrelevant since there was no evidence that the defendant suffered adult-onset mental retardation from a head injury, and the jury found as a fact that the defendant was not retarded. Further, the defendant was competent to understand the proceedings against him, and the defendant repeatedly indicated that he understood he was voluntarily waiving his rights. Also, jurors were properly selected based on impartiality with regard to the death penalty and without regard to race, and heinousness was shown by multiple stab wounds of the victim who was aware of impending doom.</SPAN></P>

He argued that &sect; 14:81.3 violated the equal protection provisions of La. Const. art.

On appeal, the court found that although the trial court discussed the constitutional grounds that were properly raised by defendant, its declaration of unconstitutionality of the statute was not based on those grounds. The trial court relied upon constitutional grounds that were not properly raised, La. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, in granting the motion to quash and finding &sect; 14:81.3&nbsp;unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers brought suit against defendants, a city, a tax collection firm, and law firms, challenging the assessment of penalties, interest, and attorney fees in connection with the collection of property taxes. A Louisiana trial court held that the city ordinance in question was constitutional. The Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), reversed and ordered a remand. The city and the other defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance in question permitted the city to place for collection with an attorney or collection agent delinquent ad valorem property taxes, to levy penalties, including a penalty to cover costs of collection by an attorney or collection agent, for delinquent ad valorem property taxes, and to sue to collect the delinquent tax. The court held that the ordinance was an unconstitutional exercise of the city's plenary power under its home rule charter because La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 25 provided tax sales as the exclusive method for a governmental subdivision to collect delinquent ad valorem property taxes and did not allow for the imposition of a penalty for such taxes. The ordinance was unconstitutional to the extent it imposed penalties, other than interest, upon delinquent ad valorem property taxes on immovables. The constitutional provision relating to property taxation, La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 25(B), permitted a governmental subdivision to impose only the taxes, interest, and costs in proceeding to sell the property for the delinquent ad valorem taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the intermediate appellate court's judgment insofar as it held the ordinance unconstitutional with respect to provisions that permitted the city to proceed other than by tax sales to collect delinquent ad valorem property taxes and that permitted the city to impose penalties other than interest. The remainder of the judgment was vacated, and the matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Louisiana Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, affirmed the decision of the district court by granting defendants', medical center, doctor, and physicians' insurer, exception of prescription on plaintiff family's medical malpractice action. The supreme court granted a rehearing to consider whether the determination that the three-year time limitation in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5638 was preemptive was a correct interpretation of Louisiana law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that 1987 La. Acts 915, &sect; 1, amending and reenacting La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628, did not evidence a legislative intent to change the result of a case and make the statute's three-year period preemptive. Had the Legislature meant for the time period to be preemptive, it could have expressed its intent in the title or text of the act, or in the language of the statute itself. The supreme court erred in its original opinion concluding that &sect; 9:5628 established a preemptive time period and the family's action against the doctor, filed over three years after the alleged act of malpractice, was extinguished by peremption. The family's claims against the doctor were properly dismissed. The family had 90 days, plus the remainder of the one-year prescriptive period that was unused at the time the request for a medical review panel was filed (282 days), or until January 29, 2003, to bring the doctor, who had been previously named in the medical review panel, into the suit. Their attempt to bring him into the lawsuit on March 15, 2005, came too late. The district court correctly sustained the peremptory exception of prescription.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Seventh Judicial District Court, Catahoula Parish, Louisiana, granted judgment in favor of appellee landowner by declaring 2006 La. Acts 312 (Act 312) unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated La. Const. art. V, &sect; 16, the Fifth Amendment, and La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 4.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Reading La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:29, the supreme court found it clear and unambiguous that the provisions of Act 312 were called into play when any litigation or pleading making a judicial demand arising from or alleging environmental damage was filed. It required the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) compliance by private parties involving cleanup and remediation activities subject to DNR's jurisdiction. Act 312 applied retrospectively and prospectively except for the limited number of cases for which an order had been issued or signed setting the case for trial as of March 27, 2006. Act 312 adopted a procedure and simply sought to ensure that the property that was environmentally damages was actually remediated. The district court erred when it found that Act 312 unconstitutional because its retroactive application to the lawsuit filed prior to the effective date of the act impermissibly disturbed the landowners' vested rights. Act 312 did not divest the district court of original jurisdiction. It did not deny access to the courts. The district court remained an active participant in the entire restoration process.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court noted that the statute contained an express retroactivity clause. The damages sought by the owner and the putative class were damages arising out of Hurricane Katrina, which occurred on August 29, 2005, and thus were sustained after August 26, 2005. There was no merit in the owner's argument that the statute did not apply because his claims were not based solely on La. Civ. Code Ann. arts. 2317 and 2317.1. The statute clearly applied to the causes of action under La. Civ. Code Ann. arts. 2317 and 2317.1 set forth by the owner and the putative class in the case. There was no merit to PPG's argument that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800(H) did not divest the owner or class of any vested rights, but merely changed the plaintiffs' burden of proof. The retroactive application of the statute would unconstitutionally divest the owner and the putative class of vested rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of the decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which dismissed defendant's motion to dismiss and then, after defendant filed a motion to reconsider ruling, held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:578.1 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented on appeal was whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:578.1&nbsp;unconstitutionally discriminated against DWI offenders who entered into pretrial diversion programs, and thus violated the equal protection guarantees of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The type of classification presented within &sect; La. R.S. 15:578.1 was not one of those specifically enumerated within La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Consequently, the statute's classification was subject to the lowest level of equal protection scrutiny, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:578.1 was presumed to be constitutional unless defendant, as the statute's challenger, was able to prove that the classification did not suitably further an appropriate state interest. The interests set forth by the State in protecting Louisiana's citizens and visitors from the dangers of intoxicated drivers were appropriate and defendant failed to offer proof to the contrary. Accordingly, the district court's judgment declaring &sect; 15:578.1&nbsp;unconstitutional was erroneous and was therefore reversed. Defendant's motion for expungement was hereby dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the First Judicial District Court, for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), convicted defendant of first-degree murder under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 and recommended a sentence of death. After denying postconviction motions, the trial court sentenced defendant to death. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because defendant did not establish that reasonable grounds existed to suggest he was mentally retarded under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.5.1, his death sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment. Preliminary test results showed that defendant possibly had a low intelligence quotient, but these results were insufficient to establish mental retardation under the statute, Moreover, defendant refused to participate in further testing designed to determine whether he was mentally retarded. Also, he was never diagnosed as mentally retarded despite numerous assessments while he was in school, and his own adaptive skills such as holding a steady job negated a reasonable likelihood that he qualified as mentally retarded. Defendant was not exempt from the death penalty based on his mental age because he was 18 years old when he committed capital murder and therefore was not eligible to benefit from the bright-line exemption for offenders under age 18. Also, the record showed that he was competent to stand trial under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. &sect; 641. Considering the offense and the offender, the death sentence imposed in this case was not disproportionately harsh.</SPAN></P>

Summary judgment was granted in favor of the LIGA. The First Circuit Court of Appeal, Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1386(A) did not apply retroactively in the matter. The companies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies alleged they had been named as defendants in approximately 500 silicosis suits filed in Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi. The plaintiffs in the silicosis suits claimed they were exposed to silica dust over long periods of time, with some exposure dates ranging from 1965 to 2003. The companies sought a declaration that the LIGA owed them indemnity and/or defense for exposure dates during the years 1977 through 1982, when the companies were insured by a now insolvent insurer. In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court of appeal found that retroactive application of the amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1386(A) to the companies was unconstitutional. The reviewing court held retroactive application of the statute was not prohibited. The Louisiana Legislature specifically provided that the statute was to be applied to all pending claims and there was no constitutional infirmities. The companies were entitled to indemnity for the years 1977 through 1982 from the LIGA, but only after the pro rata shares of all insurers that provided coverage in the Louisiana suits against the companies were determined by judgment or settlement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sued the city for breach of contract relative to renovations to a stadium.

When the city failed to pay the judgment, the claimant brought the instant litigation, filing a petition for writ of mandamus. The City made an unconditional tender to the claimant of the principal amount of the judgment, but refused at the same time to pay the legal interest, which amounted to $ 70,301.66. The court of appeal required the city to pay the remainder of the judgment, finding that because the city had appropriated up to $ 15 million to a retained risk fund, a fund established specifically to pay legal settlements and judgments, mandamus was appropriate. The reviewing court held that the claimant could not compel the city through a writ of mandamus to pay the judgment. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5109(B)(2) required a specific appropriation of funds to pay a particular judgment before disbursement of those funds could be compelled by writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State contended the trial court erred in finding that the fine in question was unconstitutional. The supreme court disagreed, holding that La. Rev. Stat.

Section 32:57(G) was a charge that had as its primary purpose the raising of revenue, and was, therefore, a &quot;tax.&quot; As provided in the statute, the $ 5.00 cost was collected for the purpose of supplementing police salaries and acquisition and maintenance of police equipment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought an action against defendants. The trial court denied defendants' exception of prescription/peremption. On appeal, defendants claimed that the trial court erred in declaring La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 191&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court found that nothing in the trial court's judgment declared a law or ordinance unconstitutional. The issue of constitutionality was raised in a filing by plaintiff captioned as a memorandum. However, under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 852, a memorandum was not a pleading recognized under the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure and was not a proper method to challenge the constitutionality of a statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence. The supreme court found that the collection of defendant's DNA pursuant to the subpoena under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 66 was improper, but that the evidence would have been inevitably discovered. The State's attempt to file a subpoena duces tecum through the use of art. 66 was a circumvention of the mandates for the issuance of a search warrant based upon probable cause. However, due to the sheer size and complexity of the search for the serial killer, other agencies working independently from the task force received tips naming defendant as a suspect before and after the illegal search. Law enforcement already suspected defendant and had an established operational procedure to investigate him at the time the DNA was obtained and matched. Law enforcement then acquired probable cause to arrest defendant and secure his DNA to identify him as the victim's assailant as well as the other murders. Consequently, defendant's DNA would have been inevitably collected and matched to his victims. Thus, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

The courts below determined that a parish's exception of no cause of action would lie. The taxpayer filed a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of Livingston, Louisiana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish passed an ordinance that purported to require the payment of a documentary transaction tax upon execution by parties of any instrument affecting immovable property located in the parish. The taxpayer argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2110 did not control, as it applied only to ad valorem taxes and not to other taxes such as the tax at issue. If the statute did indeed apply only to ad valorem taxes, and did not, then, provide the exclusive remedy for protesting other types of taxes such as the documentary transfer tax at issue, then the taxpayer need not have pled in her petition the procedures contained within the statute, and the courts below erred in sustaining the parish's exception of no cause of action. The supreme court found that the legislature did not intend for &sect; 47:2110 to provide the exclusive remedy for protesting taxes such as the documentary transfer tax at issue. Consequently, the taxpayer did not need to have pled in her petition the procedures contained within the statute. Further, because the exception of prescription likewise depended upon the applicability of &sect; 47:2110 to the instant suit, that exception also fails.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company, located in a pre-existing industrial area, brought an action against respondent taxing entities for a newly established millage it paid under protest, contending that it was not subject to inclusion and taxation by a newly created special service district. A judgment was rendered in favor of the taxing entities, and the Louisiana Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Rapides Parish, affirmed. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the assessment of the ad valorem taxes against the company was proper, and further concluded that La.

On review, the company challenged, inter alia, the appellate court's finding that the company could be subject to inclusion and taxation by a newly created special service district, and that &sect; 33:130.16 had been tacitly repealed. The supreme court concluded that &sect; 33:130.16 had not been tacitly repealed as it and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:1203 could be harmonized and were not in conflict with each other. After reviewing La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:130.11 et seq. and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 51:1202, 1203, the supreme court also concluded that industrial areas were to be excluded from inclusion and taxation only from those special districts providing services specifically enumerated in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:130.15 (repealed 1995, now codified at La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:1202). Because recreational services were not listed in the statutes, the company could be included in the recreation district at issue and, thus, could also be taxed in this district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate was elected to serve the remainder of a term after another senator left his office.

The district court dismissed the petition filed by the objectors. The court of appeal found that the candidate was ineligible, and this appeal followed. In affirming the court of appeal, the supreme court determined that La. Const. art. III, &sect;&nbsp;4(E) prohibited the candidate from running again. After looking at the legislative history, the supreme court determined that the date of election was determinative in an analysis of the applicability of term limits. The date that the secretary of state promulgated the election was the date upon which the candidate was officially elected. Here, the candidate was elected to serve the unexpired remainder of the first term as of December 18, 1997, which was prior to the halfway point of that term. It was finally noted that La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city and mayor sued the Louisiana Assessors' Retirement Fund and state treasurer, challenging the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:1418. The Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) declared the statute unconstitutional under La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 26(C), and art. VI, &sect;&sect; 26(B) and 32, but denied the other constitutional challenges. The Fund and state treasurer appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Contrary to the district court's conclusions, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:1481 did not require a percentage of taxes dedicated to other purposes to be diverted from those purposes for which the taxes were enacted in order to finance the Fund; therefore, the statute did not violate La. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 26(B) and 32. The statute did not distribute revenue sharing funds to an entity not entitled to receive those funds, in contravention of La Const. art. VII, &sect; 26(C). The district court properly rejected the challenge under La. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2, because as a political subdivision of the state, the city was not protected by those sections. La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 10(C), did not apply as the statute did not attempt to enforce a judgment against the city or seize public funds as the result of a judgment emanating from a lawsuit. The statute did not violate La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 19, where the city failed to show that the amounts collected exceeded the 5.75 mill ceiling. Finally, the statute did not violate La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, as there was no evidence that it created a legislative classification or that any classification did not suitably further an appropriate state interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to the conclusion that the statute violated several provisions of the Louisiana Constitution, but was affirmed as to the conclusions that the statute did not violate the separation of powers doctrine, the constitutional prohibition against seizure of public funds, the constitutional ceiling on state ad valorem taxes, and the equal protection guarantees of the United States and Louisiana Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. 22:253(A), as amended by 2004 La. Acts 689, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The beneficiary argued that two industrial life insurance policies issued in 1958 and 1963, respectively, each with a face value of $500, required payment in full of her husband's 2003 funeral. The district court declared 2004 La. Acts 689 unconstitutional, finding that the history of the Act, which amended La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 22:253(A), did not support the legislature's declaration that the Act was interpretive and, therefore, subject to retroactive application. On appeal, the court held that the district court erred in reaching the constitutional issue because the issue was resolvable by applying the unambiguous language of the contracts. The contracts clearly relied upon the incorporated policy schedules to limit the total cash value of each policy to $500. The contracts' detailed description of funeral benefits, upon which the beneficiary relied, were subject to the face amounts shown on the schedules. Any other interpretation of the parties' intent was absurd. The funeral home and the insurer did not breach the contracts by crediting the beneficiary in the amount of $1,000 toward the total cost of her husband's $5,998 funeral and requiring her to pay the difference.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court and awarded summary judgment to the funeral home and the insurer. The court pretermitted addressing whether the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his death sentence to the supreme court pursuant to La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(D)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's videotaped accusations of rape were admissible and did not violate the Confrontation Clause because the victim was physically present to testify. In addition, the supreme court stated that child rapists as a class of offenders, unlike the young or mentally retarded, shared no common characteristic tending to mitigate the moral culpability of their crimes. Furthermore, the execution of child rapists would serve the goals of deterrence and retribution just as well as execution of first-degree murderers would. Moreover, short of a first-degree murderer, the supreme court could think of no other non-homicide crime more deserving of the death penalty. Thus, the supreme court held that the death penalty for the rape of a child under 12 was not disproportionate under the Eighth Amendment. Therefore, defendant's death sentence for raping an eight-year-old child was proper. Also, pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 905.9 and La. Sup. Ct. R. XXVIII, the supreme court found that the sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion or prejudice, the evidence supported the statutory aggravating factors, and the sentence was not disproportionate to the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State contended defendant failed to prove that the district attorney had a personal interest in the cause which was in conflict with the fair and impartial administration of justice such that he should have been recused pursuant to La.

The supreme court disagreed, finding that the district attorney's personal animosity toward defendant stemming from the district attorney's belief that defendant started or spread a salacious rumor about him and a member of his family was a factor in making certain prosecutorial decisions; as such, the supreme court concluded that the district attorney's ability to fairly and impartially conduct defendant's trial was called into question. Consequently, the district attorney should have been recused in accordance with art. 680(1), and the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to recuse.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed, holding that although treating &sect; 40:982 as a substantive element of the offense and including the allegations of the prior offense or offenses in the charging instrument was erroneous, this was not a structural error as it did not necessarily render the criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence. Furthermore, defendant's failure to object to the inclusion of the prior convictions in the bill, his failure to object to the presentation of evidence of these convictions to the jury, and his failure to request a limiting instruction from the trial court, thereby waived any error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court granted appellant doctor's motion for summary judgment, thereby finding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42(B), the cap on medical malpractice damages, was constitutional. However, nothing in the trial court's ruling discussed La. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. The Court of Appeal (Louisiana) reversed, finding the cap unconstitutional for failing to provide an adequate remedy as guaranteed under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 22.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor and intervenor patients' compensation fund appealed, seeking to reverse the court of appeal's holding. Appellee parents had pleaded La. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 as a ground for unconstitutionality, but did not rely on that ground in their motion for summary judgment. Therefore, the question of whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42(B) violated La. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 was never briefed and argued before the district court, nor was that issue passed upon by the district court in its ruling denying the parents' motion for summary judgment. Under those circumstances, the Supreme Court of Louisiana had to conclude that any purported violation of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 was not made an issue in the district court. In the absence of initial consideration of that ground by the district court, the court of appeal erred in declaring La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42(B)&nbsp;unconstitutional because it was in violation of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. The supreme court declined the parents' request to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction to consider whether the statute violated any other constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The writs were granted. The court of appeal's judgment of unconstitutionality was vacated on procedural grounds and the case was remanded to the court of appeal for consideration of the remaining issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff individual sued defendant concrete company and insurer for work-related injuries suffered on a job site. After an appeal of the jury verdict, the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Parish of Acadia (Louisiana) held, inter alia, that the individual was entitled to have his Batson/Edmonson challenge heard on appeal, rather than solely on application for supervisory writ. Certiorari was granted on the parties' consolidated writ applications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary legal issue was the proper procedural mechanism by which a party could seek review of a Batson/Edmonson challenge in a civil case. An intermediate appellate court was allowed to review a Batson/Edmonson challenge in a civil case on supervisory writ application or on appeal as that practice was in line with the procedure utilized in criminal cases and was consistent with the practice regarding challenges for cause in civil cases and challenges in federal courts. On the merits, the lower court's ruling that the trial court erred in granting a peremptory challenge of two prospective jurors was affirmed. However, the concrete company's reasons were not sufficient as to one prospective juror to meet the Batson/Edmonson standard. Because the trial court was manifestly erroneous in finding that the individual did not carry his burden of proving purposeful discrimination as to that juror, the lower court erred in conducting a de novo review of the record and in rendering judgment. Instead, the matter was remanded so the trial court could conduct a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as to the lower court's consideration of the Batson/Edmonson ruling on appeal and its ultimate conclusion that the concrete company's reasons in support of peremptory challenges against two prospective jurors was sufficient. The judgment was reversed as to the lower court's conduct of a de novo review in rendering judgment. The case was remanded so the trial court could conduct a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wireless carriers filed a direct appeal of a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which declared that a state universal service fee (SUSF) was not a tax and therefore was within the authority and jurisdiction of defendant, the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC), granted by the Louisiana Constitution and the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The LPSC's order mandated that all telecommunications service providers, including the wireless carriers, were to contribute to the SUSF. The carriers had filed a petition for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:963, seeking to enjoin the enforcement of the order. The lower court granted LPSC's motion for partial summary judgment and denied the carriers' request for a preliminary injunction under La. Code Civ. Proc. art. 3601. On review, the court affirmed, finding that the SUSF assessment was a subsidy assessment that did not constitute an improper tax in violation of La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 21 and art. VII, &sect; 1. The contributions associated with the SUSF were imposed only on end-user revenues from the carriers and were not intended to raise revenue. Rather, the LPSC was using its regulatory authority to allocate the costs for the administration of a regulatory program as permitted under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, specifically 47 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 253, 254. Thus, there was no showing that the LPSC's implementation of the SUSF was arbitrary, capricious, or a clear abuse of discretion or not based on the factual evidence presented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a bill of information alleging video voyeurism. The State entered a nolle prosequi, but later reinstated the charge. The district court quashed the bill of information, and the court of appeal found no error. In reversing, the supreme court determined that the dismissal of a case was not a bar to subsequent prosecution under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 693 absent certain limited exceptions. However, a motion to quash was appropriate in certain cases if the prosecutor was favoring the State at the expense of defendant. In this case, the nolle prosequi was entered because the victim was not present for trial and was wavering in her commitment to going forward with the case. The State did not violate any of the time constraints imposed by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 578. As such, it was an abuse of discretion to grant the motion to quash. Next, the speedy trial rights applied to the states by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were not violated. The four Barker factors were analyzed. The 19-month delay was attributable to both parties, the right was not asserted until a motion to quash was filed, and defendant suffered no prejudice to his case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of the lower courts were reversed, and the matter was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents alleged that the doctor unnecessarily delayed their son's transfer to another medical facility, which caused the loss of a testicle. They filed a medical malpractice case against the doctor exactly one year later, but filed a patient compensation fund claim more than one year later. The court case was dismissed due to prematurity until the medical review panel issued an opinion. Thereafter, the parents filed another court action, and the doctor's exception of prescription was denied. The court of appeal affirmed, and the doctor sought review. In reversing, the supreme court determined that the court of appeal erred by failing to hold that the LeBreton case applied retroactively. The supreme court analyzed the three Lovell factors in making its determination, which included the establishment of a new principal of law, the prior history of the rule in question, and the inequity imposed by retroactive application. The filing of the claim before the panel suspended prescription under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.47(A)(2)(a). Because retroactive application was warranted, the exception of prescription was sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district was a political subdivision of the State, created to facilitate economic growth in an area comprised of 75 acres. The project at issue consisted of a retail outlet and was to be funded to the issuance of bonds by the district through sales tax increments under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:9038.4A. A hearing on the peremptory exception of peremption was held. The court held that the individual defendants did not demonstrate how the right to assert the challenge had an ascertainable monetary value. Because the bonds for which the resolution pertained were issued by a local political subdivision and constituted revenue bonds under a sales tax increment financing plan, both La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 35(B) and La. Rev. Stat. 33:9038.4L were applicable with their respective peremptive periods. The individual defendants failed to challenge the provisions within the 30-day peremptive period, and therefore, the right to challenge the provisions made for the security and payment of the bonds, was perempted. The court found no procedural due process was required beyond that established to notify the public of the resolution by publication in the official journal of the district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurance companies filed a petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Nineteenth Judicial District Court (Louisiana), which found that 2006 La. Acts 729 and 802 extending the prescriptive periods under which certain insurance claims arising from two hurricanes could be filed and which might have altered the contractual provisions of insurance policies regarding the time period in which to bring a claim, were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the aftermath of two devastating hurricanes that caused extensive property damage and displacement of citizens of Louisiana, the governor issued executive orders that resulted in the Acts at issue. The court affirmed, and held that the Acts, including the resultant La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:658.3, indicated the intent that the provisions be applied both retroactively and prospectively for the types of claims described therein. Also, the Acts were substantive in nature. The Acts did not violate the Contracts Clause of the U.S. or Louisiana Constitutions because, while the extension of the prescriptive period in which to file claims constituted a substantial impairment of the contractual relationship between the insurers and their policyholders, they were enacted to protect the health and general welfare of the citizens. Further, the extension of the prescriptive period was based upon a legitimate public purpose, and the substantial impairment was of the type that could be anticipated in the industry. The court also held that no Supremacy Clause violation occurred because the Legislature made no attempt to regulate the federally-regulated National Flood Insurance Program.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with two counts of first-degree murder and filed its notice of intent to seek the death penalty. Defendant claimed he was mentally retarded and thus not subject to a sentence of death and filed a motion to declare unconstitutional&nbsp;La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.5.1. La. The Eleventh Judicial District Court of Sabine Parish, Louisiana, declared art. 905.5.1 unconstitutional, and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State challenged the trial court's findings that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.5.1 was unconstitutional. The supreme court held that the trial court erred in declaring the article unconstitutional as the legislature's choice of permitting the issue of whether defendant was mentally retarded (and thus not subject to a death sentence) to be submitted to the jury did not offend constitutional guarantees; nothing in the U.S. Supreme Court's jurisprudence suggested that requiring the jury rather than the trial court to decide whether defendant had established mental retardation violated due process or U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Defendant failed to show that the article was facially unconstitutional and that it seriously affected his rights, as required for a person to have standing to bring a constitutional challenge. His challenge to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.5.1(G) was speculative because the trial court had taken no action that precluded it from either conducting a pretrial hearing on the issue of mental retardation or instructing the jury of the prohibition of executing the mentally retarded.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that even though the trial court erred by admitting into evidence a statement defendant made to police officers during an interrogation because the officers failed to honor defendant's invocation of his right to remain silent, the error was harmless because the State presented overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. Defendant's ex-girlfriend positively identified him as the person who tied her up and kidnapped her at gunpoint, and the victim's wife, who was also shot by defendant, identified him as the shooter. Evidence obtained from defendant's home and vehicle corroborated the ex-girlfriend's account. The trial court did not err by admitting into evidence statements defendant made while being booked because the statements were not the product of a custodial interrogation. The officer specifically informed defendant that he was not there to obtain a statement and it was defendant who initiated asking questions about the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In petitioner employee's action for a declaratory judgment, respondent Louisiana Office of Workers' Compensation Administration (OWCA) challenged a judgment of the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Tangipahoa Parish (Louisiana) that declared La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208(E)&nbsp;unconstitutional and issued an injunction permanently enjoining the OWCA from enforcing or implementing the fraud forfeiture provisions of &sect; 23:1208(E).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee had filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits, and the employer responded, asserting that the employee violated the fraud provisions of La.

The trial court held that &sect; 1208(E) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the record provided no basis for the trial court's judgment. The court found that the employee's petition was the only pleading of record and that the employee failed to establish that he had standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 23:1208 by presenting evidence or documents to show he was a person whose legal relations were affected by &sect; 23:1208 as required by La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1872. Therefore the court held that it could not be judicially determined that &sect; 23:1208 violated the employee's equal protection rights. The court noted that the employee failed to present evidence to show he was an employee; that he had filed a workers' compensation claim; or that the employer had filed a fraud counterclaim under &sect; 23:1208.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for shooting into the home where his wife and children were staying. The appellate court vacated defendant's sentence on the ground that the firearm sentencing provisions set out in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.1 et seq., did not apply and that the trial court was not required to impose the maximum sentence as mandated by art. 893.3(C). On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the State could invoke the firearm sentencing provisions of art. 893.1 et seq., even though an element of assault by drive-by shooting also formed the basis for limiting the discretion of the trial court in sentencing. When the legislature amended the firearm sentencing provisions it clearly intended that they apply to felonies defined as crimes of violence by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:2(13), and among the felonies enumerated was assault by drive-by shooting under &sect; 14:2(13)(bb). Therefore, the legislature intended that the prosecution have the discretion to invoke the firearm sentencing provisions despite the fact that discharge of a firearm was an essential element of the underlying offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Louisiana trial court granted appellee church's motion for summary judgment and denied the motion for partial summary judgment brought by appellant, Ascension Parish, Louisiana, Sales and Use Tax Authority (parish), on the parish's sales/use tax assessment against the church in connection with the purchase and use of airplanes. The court of appeals affirmed. The parish petitioned for writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish argued that a &quot;taxable moment&quot; occurred when the church's airplanes were withdrawn from intestate transportation and came to rest in Louisiana. The supreme court noted that if the church or similar resident consumers could travel out-of-state and purchase airplanes or other tangible personal property and not pay a sales or use tax, then import those goods into Louisiana for subsequent use in interstate commerce, and be immune from Louisiana use tax because they ultimately used, or planned to use, the goods in interstate commerce, then they effectively circumvented decades of use tax jurisprudence. Once the planes were imported and hangared in Louisiana, when they had been withdrawn from interstate commerce and came to rest in Louisiana, Louisiana's tax on storage and use was effective and a taxable moment occurred in Louisiana. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:305(E) spoke to taxing both planes in Louisiana since they came to rest there and became a part of the mass of Louisiana property. Because the taxable moment contemplated by the parish ordinances did not occur in Ascension Parish, it did not have the statutory authority to impose a use tax on the airplanes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The couple had established a right of action in their suit. They clearly belonged to the class of persons that had a legal interest in the subject matter of the litigation at issue. However, they failed to state a cause of action for damages under &sect; 18:1463 because the statute exclusively provided injunctive relief and granted no other civil remedy to them. In their petition, the couple sought damages, which were not recoverable under &sect; 18:1463. Even if the petition sought injunctive relief, the couple would not have been entitled to injunctive relief because the election was over and the husband was no longer an affected candidate. The district court could have resolved the issue of whether the couple stated a cause of action for defamation under &sect;&nbsp;18:1463 on nonconstitutional grounds and should have done so. And, because their petition had not alleged facts sufficient to establish the general tort of defamation, the couple should have been granted leave to amend the petition to state a cause of action for the general tort of defamation, without consideration of the constitutionality of &sect; 18:1463. The district court's declaration of unconstitutionality was premature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's judgment granting the company's exceptions of no right of action and no cause of action was reversed. The case was remanded to allow the couple leave to amend the petition to state a cause of action for the general tort of defamation. The district court's declaration of unconstitutionality was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that defendants failed to comply with the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5105, and further, that &sect; 13:5105(D) was an unconstitutional deprivation of their right to equal protection under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The trial court found that the statute violated plaintiffs' right to equal protection. The court noted that the waiver against the prohibition of a jury trial did not select the mode of trial; it merely allowed the possibility of trial by jury. The court held that the third level of scrutiny applied. The court had previously found that &sect; 13:5105(D) applied in every possible locality throughout the state as well as to every political subdivision in the state. The school board waived the prohibition against civil jury trials by resolution passed prior to plaintiffs filing suit. Thus, the waiver was in effect prior to suit being filed. The court found that at the time suit was filed either party was entitled to request a jury trial. Thus, there was no discrimination. Because both parties had equal access to a jury trial, and were treated the same, there was no violation of the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being informed by appellant sheriff's office that an ordinance prohibiting cockfighting would be enforced, respondent game clubs filed a petition seeking injunctive relief and a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court found that appellant Parish improperly invaded the state's police power by enacting the ordinance; the Second Circuit Court of Appeal, Caddo Parish, Louisiana, affirmed. The Parish sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the Parish challenged the appellate court's holding that Caddo Parish, La., Ordinance No. 2432 (an animal cruelty ordinance which extended its protections to &quot;fowl&quot;) contradicted the state's animal cruelty statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:102.1, which exempted &quot;fowl&quot; from its applicable provisions. The clubs suggested that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:102.1(D) legislatively excluded &quot;fowl&quot; from the provisions of the statute, indicating the legislature's implicit endorsement of cockfighting. The supreme court disagreed with the clubs, finding that the state had passed no general law which could be interpreted as an attempt to preempt the field with regard to authorizing, prohibiting, or regulating cockfighting. Local governments therefore could authorize or prohibit the conduct of cockfighting tournaments within municipal boundaries. As such, the supreme court held that Caddo Parish, La., Ordinance No. 2432, &sect; 4-14 prohibiting cockfighting did not offend a Louisiana constitutional or statutory provision. And as there was no unconstitutionality or illegality regarding the ordinance, the preliminary injunction preventing the enforcement of the ordinance was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rulings of the lower courts were reversed, the preliminary injunction was vacated, and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The relationship between lead counsel and associate counsel had deteriorated and they could not work together to represent defendant. It was reasonable for the district court to retain lead counsel and to substitute associate counsel because the district court specifically found that lead counsel had filed all the necessary motions for the defense, including a successful motion for a change of venue, and had &quot;gone beyond the call of duty&quot; in her representation. The district court had defendant's letter expressing his desire that associate counsel remain on his case, and was therefore aware of his position on the issue. Additionally, defendant was present at the hearing on the motion to substitute lead counsel and to vacate the order substituting another attorney for associate counsel. Additionally, the supreme court found that the record contained reasonable grounds to doubt whether defendant was mentally retarded and exempt from capital punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only facts of relevance were that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily pleaded guilty to aggravated assault upon a peace officer with a firearm after being charged by bill of information with attempted first degree murder of a peace officer. Certiorari was granted to consider whether a trial judge lacked jurisdiction to accept a defendant's informed and voluntary guilty plea to a crime that was not responsive to the crime charged in the bill of information when the district attorney had not filed a written amendment to the bill. The supreme court also considered whether the trial judge's acceptance of such a plea was an error patent that required reversal of the conviction on appeal. The supreme court noted that in this case defendant stood by his plea on appeal and in argument before the lower appellate court. The failure of the district attorney to amend the bill to conform to the plea agreement under these circumstances could not be considered to render the plea unintelligent or involuntary. The trial judge was not without jurisdiction to accept a defendant's knowing and voluntary guilty plea simply because the plea was unresponsive to the charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney, an experienced prosecutor, was the senior counsel in a death penalty case. He obtained a statement from a witness regarding an identification. However, he failed to disclose this information to the defense, as required by La. St. Bar art. XVI, R. 3.8. After the murder conviction was overturned, disciplinary proceedings were instituted against the attorney. In imposing a suspension, the court determined that a prosecutor had a duty to disclose exculpatory evidence under Brady and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 718, 719(a), 722. The statement in question was covered by Brady because there was a reasonable probability that the proceeding would have been different had the evidence been disclosed to the defense. The record showed that the witness in question was the only one that positively identified defendant as the shooter. The court looked to La. Sup. Ct. R. XIX, &sect; 10(C) in deciding the appropriate sanction for the knowing violation. The only aggravating circumstances was the attorney's substantial experience as a prosecutor. There were many mitigating circumstances. As such, the period of suspension was deferred in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) granted defendant's motion to quash an information charging him with being a second felony drug offender and declared unconstitutional&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:982. By placing the fact of his prior conviction in the bill of information for possession of cocaine, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967, his federal and state constitutional rights were violated. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 40:982 granted to the State the right to seek an enhanced sentence when a person was convicted of a drug-related offense if, prior to the commission of the instant conviction, the offender had been convicted of any other drug-related offense. The issue was whether &sect;&nbsp;40:982 created an additional substantive element to the charged offense, which had to be placed in the bill of information, read to the jury, proven at trial, and found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, or whether it was a sentencing enhancement provision, subject to a separate proceeding after conviction which was not presented to the jury before a determination of guilt was made. Resolving a split among the circuits, the Supreme Court of Louisiana held that &sect; 40:982, when properly applied, was a sentencing enhancement to be implemented after conviction similar to the Habitual Offender Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, and was constitutional. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:982 was not a substantive element of the instant drug-related offense which it sought to enhance, possession of cocaine in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967, and thus the prior conviction should not have been in the information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The granting of the motion to quash was affirmed and the trial court's determination of the statute's unconstitutionality was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The jury seated consisted of nine white jurors and three African-American jurors. Towards the end of voir dire, the defense made one Batson challenge. At the time the defense lodged the challenge, nine jurors had been chosen, three of whom were African-Americans. In total, the State exercised ten peremptory challenges. It excused five white jurors and five African-American jurors. The defense exercised nine peremptory challenges, all against white jurors. The State proffered non-racial reasons for its peremptory strikes of all five African-American jurors. The defense's Batson challenge had already failed when the State proffered its reasons because the trial court clearly found no discernible pattern of discriminatory intent. Thus the burden never shifted to the prosecution to explain the racial exclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal held the WTC tax increment financing (TIF) statute unconstitutional as a special law in violation of La. Const. art. III, &sect; 12(A)(7) because it created an exemption from the hotel occupancy tax where certain proceeds of the tax presently secured outstanding bonds and, additionally, the exemption was not uniform, in violation of La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 29(D). The Supreme Court of Louisiana held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:9038.21 created an exemption from the hotel occupancy taxes that the proposed hotel in the WTC taxing district would otherwise have been subject to. But for the WTC TIF statute, the Orleans Parish hotel occupancy taxes would have been collected when the WTC hotel began functioning. The hotel occupancy taxes were imposed on all hotels in Orleans Parish; to prevent the levy of a hotel occupancy tax on a hotel in Orleans Parish involved the enactment of an exemption. The legislature was prohibited under La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 29(D) from enacting tax exemptions where those taxes secured bonds already authorized. The unconstitutional portion of the statute was not severable, thus La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:9038.21 was unconstitutional in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Parish of Iberia, Louisiana, appellant department of revenue (DOR) challenged the decision affirming the judgment of the district court granting the refund requested by respondent corporate taxpayer on its claim for tax paid on purchases of diesel fuel used for production of motive power on the taxpayer's drilling barges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues involved whether 2002 La. Acts 40, amending La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:305.1, could be applied retroactively and also the imposition of sales taxes on diesel fuel sold, delivered, and consumed in Louisiana by drilling barges in the court of their offshore drilling activities. The court reversed, and held that because 2002 La. Acts 40 represented new substantive law passed under the guise of interpretive legislation, it could only have prospective effect and could not be applied in the case. The district court and the court of appeal focused exclusively on the third element of the exemption under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:305.1(B) and failed to specifically consider whether the drilling barges were &quot;ships or vessels.&quot; The drilling barges could not move under their own power and were towed from one job location to the next, and were thus &quot;barges&quot; rather than &quot;vessels&quot; for purposes of &sect; 47:305.1. Further, the board of tax appeals' findings that the fuel was sold, delivered, and consumed in Louisiana were adequately supported by the record. When the fuel was consumed in the taxpayer's drilling operations in Louisiana, it came to rest and became a part of the state's property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A writ of certiorari for rehearing was filed in the Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) regarding a decision of the Supreme Court of Louisiana in which it had eschewed a disjunctive reading of the two paragraphs of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 466 and the use of the societal expectations test as a method of determining what was a component part of a building within the meaning of the first paragraph of that article.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court granted rehearing for the sole purpose of considering the retroactivity of its decision insofar as it discussed the proper interpretation of art. 466, and its definition of a component part of an immovable. Weighing the factors whether a judicial decision should be accorded prospective effect only, it concluded that its opinion should be given prospective effect only. While that opinion did not change the substantive law but rather simply applied the law as it had existed since the 1978 Civil Code Revisions, the court noted that Louisiana appellate courts had employed a disjunctive reading of art. 466, and in doing so, had drawn on the societal expectations test as a measure for determining what items could be considered component parts under the first paragraph of art. 466. Because the courts, and no doubt individuals, had relied on that approach, and there was no clear indication that foreshadowed its demise, the supreme court found that the instant case was one which was appropriate for prospective application. The court adhered to its original opinion eschewing a disjunctive reading of the two paragraphs of art. 466 but it was to be applied prospectively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the ruling of the Appellate Division of Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) declaring La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:499-501&nbsp;unconstitutional and reversing defendant's conviction for possession of marijuana. At issue was whether &sect;&sect; 15:499-501 deprived defendant of the right to confront and cross-examine the witness in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statutes in question allowed a certificate of analysis to be accepted by the trial court as prima facie proof of the substance tested without live testimony of the person performing the analysis. The court reversed, holding that the statutes did not infringe upon defendant's constitutional right to confrontation because defendant merely had to subpoena the person who performed the examination or analysis of the evidence. Once a defendant requests the subpoena, the certificate of analysis has no evidentiary value and the State must call the relevant witnesses to prove its case. Because the good-faith certification of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:501(B)(2) was imposed only on defendant and not the State, it was not construed as an unconstitutional violation of the confrontation clause. Consequently, the burden to demonstrate good faith was featherweight so as not to adversely impact defendant's right to confrontation, and defendant, who did not avail himself of the opportunity to subpoena the report-preparer, could have satisfied the good-faith requirement by merely indicating a preference for live testimony.</SPAN></P>

In the current case, if the appellate court found that the trial court's factual finding that the road was within the public road system was supported by the record, there would have been no need to reach the constitutional issues.

Ann. &sect; 26:583 (amended 1997), its relationship to other local option laws, and its application. The supreme court found that the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:583 dictated that the portion of the ward included in the election district must take on the sales characteristics of the election district. The local option status of the entirety of the election district could be changed only by a referendum election and conducted pursuant to the provisions of the local option laws, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:581 et seq. (amended 1997).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated murder cases, defense counsel challenged the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:304 and 15:571.11 in her motion to determine the source of funds to provide a competent defense. The 14th Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana) found that the statutes were unconstitutional and ordered the parish police jury (CPPJ) to make available $ 200,000 for attorney fees. The CPPJ and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that because &sect;&sect; 15:304 and 15:571.11, when read together, barred it from ordering the use of surplus funds to pay the defense costs for indigent defendants, they were unconstitutional. The Supreme Court of Louisiana held that the trial court's ruling that the statutes violated defendants' rights of due process, right to counsel, and equal protection was erroneous. The constitution stated that indigent defendants were entitled to the assistance of counsel and that the legislature had to provide a uniform system for securing and compensating qualified counsel. The statutes clearly meet the constitutional requirements because they, along with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:144 et seq. and 15:151 et seq., specifically provided the medium for state funding for indigent defense. The next issue was whether the trial court exceeded the constitutional function of the judiciary in ordering the CPPJ to set aside funding for indigent defendants. The legislature clearly determined that the state, not the parishes, would pay for indigent defense pursuant to the mandate of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Thus, the trial court erred in ordering the CPPJ to fund the indigents' defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed. Unless adequate funds were identified and made available in a manner authorized by law, upon motion of defendants, the trial judge could halt the prosecution of the instant cases until adequate funds became available to provide for the indigent defendants' constitutionally protected right to counsel or take other measures consistent with protecting their constitutional or statutory rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer brought an action for a refund of use and sales taxes paid on nuclear cameras. The taxpayer contended that it was error to conclude that no refund was due. In affirming, a plurality of the court determined that the cameras were not component parts of certain hospital buildings under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 466. As such, they were not immovables since they could have been removed without causing substantial damage to the hospital or the cameras. The plurality rejected the societal expectations test in Equibank as a means of determining component parts for immovables and a disjunctive reading of the two paragraphs of article 466 as creating two independent types of component parts. The dissent objected to the rejection of the Equibank test. Next, the court held that the medical devices exemption in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. ?? 47:305 did not apply to local sales and use tax because there was no clear statement that the exemption was to apply to such taxing authorities, as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. ???? 33:2716.1 (repealed 2003), 47:302(E). Finally, the court remanded the case for consideration of a constitutional issue that had not been addressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Revenue sought to recover income taxes and franchise taxes on the properties and taxable capital in Louisiana of respondent, the majority shareholder of a real estate investment trust (REIT). The Court of Appeal, First Circuit, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, sustained the dismissal of the action for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Department sought certiorari review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The REIT, which organized as a corporation domiciled in Nevada pursuant to 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 856(a), was not converted to a trust simply by its business operations in Louisiana. Therefore, the state laws applicable to trusts, specifically, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:287.93(A)(7), did not apply to it. However, International Harvesters and similar cases provided constitutional support for the Department's tax assessment against the majority shareholder. There was no question that the state had afforded many protections and benefits, including police protection, fire protection, and street sanitation, to the REIT's 68 retail stores located within its borders. Thus, a nexus existed for jurisdictional purposes, which was not broken by the pass-through nature of the REIT. The majority shareholder owned 100 percent of the REIT. The REIT generated some $10 million of rental income from store locations in Louisiana. Louisiana extended protection and benefits to the REIT. Therefore, International Harvester provided authority for the exercise of jurisdiction under Louisiana's long-arm statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3201.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower courts' judgments were reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee economic development district alleged that it was authorized to collect &quot;sales tax increments&quot; used to secure the issuance of bonds for financing a development. Appellant taxpayers contended that the proposed bond issuance was improper. The trial court found that the bonds were valid pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:9038.4(A)(5). The Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of Livingston (Louisiana) affirmed. The district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the taxing authority could use the dedicated funds, previously dedicated to a specified purpose by a vote of the people, for a purpose other than their dedicated use, to fund a new economic development project. The supreme court found that &sect; 33:9038.4, as written, prohibited dedicated taxes from being used for purposes other than their dedicated purpose. Section 33:9038.4(A)(1) gave the district the power to issue bonds; however, &sect; 33:9038.4(A)(5) restricted the use of previously dedicated funds. The provisions of &sect; 33:9038.4(A)(5) clearly indicated that sales tax increments could only be used where such use was permitted by the electorate. That interpretation was consistent with La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 29. Clearly, the voters were never made aware of other permitted uses for the funds and did not agree to other uses. Should the taxing entities seek to redirect the revenue derived from the tax proceeds, they would be required to re-submit a proposition to the voters of the parish for approval. Thus, the court found that &sect; 33:9038.4(A)(5) did not allow taxing entities to pledge or re-direct funds, previously dedicated to other uses absent voter approval.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee parish collector assessed use taxes against appellant cellular telephone company. Relying on Mercury Cellular Telephone Co. v. Calcasieu Parish, the trial court ordered the company to pay all assessed use taxes. The Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Third Circuit, Parish of Calcasieu held that 2002 La. Acts 85 retroactively redefining La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:301 was unconstitutional. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the limited setting in the instant case, the supreme court found that judicial economy was best served by exercising its supervisory jurisdiction. The company argued that the legislature's provision for the retroactive application of 2002 La. Acts 85 did not violate the Louisiana Constitution. It argued that the legislature did not modify well-established procedures or any applicable tax, but clarified the Mercury court's addition of requirements to the relevant ordinances relative to the taxation of cellular telephones transferred to customers at discounted prices as part of its sales of cellular telecommunication services. The supreme court found that the act was retroactive and that an analysis of the constitutional implications was needed. The legislature had sought to change the Mercury decision. By passing the Act in order to abrogate the appellate court's interpretation and application of a long-standing revised statute, the legislature clearly assumed a function more properly entrusted to the judicial branch of government. Even though the legislature had the authority to change the law after the Mercury, the changes could only have prospective application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower courts regarding the assessment of interest, penalties, and attorney fees was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court. In all other respects the judgment of the court of appeal was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Reversed; Mississippi law applies.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a driver injured in Louisiana, was a resident of Mississippi and his vehicle was covered by an insurance policy issued in Mississippi. The driver sought uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM) coverage against appellant insurer. The insurer moved for summary judgment claiming Mississippi law controlled. The trial court denied the motion and the Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans affirmed. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The policy contained a clause which reduced the UM coverage by the amount collected from the liability insurance covering the owner of the underinsured vehicle. The issue was whether Louisiana law automatically applied to a foreign UM policy in a multistate case when the accident occurred in Louisiana and involved a Louisiana resident, or whether Louisiana courts had to engage in a choice-of-law analysis to determine which state's law was applicable. Following the legislature's enactment of former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1406(D)(1)(a)(iii) by 1987 La. Acts 444, courts had differed on the impact of the amendment. The court held that a choice-of-law analysis, codified in La. Civ. Code Ann. arts. 3515 and 3537, was the appropriate way to determine which state's law applied. The court found that Mississippi had a more substantial interest in the uniform application of its laws governing insurance contracts than Louisiana had in providing an insurance remedy to an out-of-state resident injured while transitorily in Louisiana. The application of Louisiana law would have resulted in the abrogation of the Mississippi contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower courts' determinations that Louisiana law automatically applied to automobile accidents occurring in Louisiana was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant department of corrections applied for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which concluded that the trial court correctly denied the department's exception of prematurity in plaintiff inmate's action for injuries he allegedly sustained while incarcerated in a correctional facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed he experienced several severe symptoms while incarcerated and that due to the facility personnel's ignoring of his repeated requests for medical attention, he contracted a potentially fatal kidney disease. The department claimed that the inmate failed to exhaust administrative remedies per La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:1172, 15:1184. When the inmate's cause of action arose, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1172, contained in the Corrections Administrative Remedy Procedure did not require exhaustion of administrative remedies. The court denied the affirmed the decision of the court of appeal, and held that even procedural laws were not accorded retroactive effect where such retroactivity would operate unconstitutionally to disturb vested rights. The department did not sustain its burden of establishing the existence of an available administrative remedy at the time the inmate filed suit. The court of appeal correctly concluded that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1171-1179 as amended by Act 89 could not be applied retroactively to a case in which a claimant would be divested of vested rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Louisiana Secretary of State, and a city, appealed a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which ruled in favor of Plaintiffs, a political action committee, a group, and individuals, and declared La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 15&nbsp;unconstitutional in violation of La. Const art. XIII, &sect; 1(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An amendment to the Constitution of Louisiana, La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 15, was approved by the voters, and plaintiffs filed suit against defendants alleging that the election was defective and that the amendment was unconstitutional. The district court declared the amendment unconstitutional on the grounds that it contained more than one object. The court reversed, and held that the single object rule as stated in La. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1(B) required that an amendment to the constitution embody a single plan and that every provision was germane to that plan. Given the clear language of the title of the amendment, &quot;Defense of Marriage,&quot; one could logically conclude the object of the amendment was &quot;defense of marriage,&quot; and the central theme running throughout the legislative committee meetings was the need to protect the civil tradition of marriage through the adoption of a constitutional amendment. Examining each provision of the amendment, the court held that the only contract or legal instrument whereby the State was mandated to bestow all or substantially all the rights created by said contract was the contract of marriage between one man and one woman.</SPAN></P>
