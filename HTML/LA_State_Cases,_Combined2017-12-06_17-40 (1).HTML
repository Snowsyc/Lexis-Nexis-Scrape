<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 19th Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, convicted defendant of forgery and sentenced him to four years imprisonment at hard labor. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it imposed an excessive sentence and defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel at sentencing. The appellate court found that the record did not contain a motion to reconsider sentence nor did defendant object to the sentence. Under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.1D, a failure to file or make a motion to reconsider sentence precluded defendant from raising the excessiveness argument on appeal. The appellate court examined the sentence for excessiveness because it was necessary to do so as part of the analysis of the ineffective counsel issue. The trial court ordered a presentence investigation (PSI) report and considered the PSI in imposing sentence. Although defendant was a first felony offender, he had an extensive criminal record including alcohol and drug related offenses and crimes against the person. The trial court demonstrated full compliance with the requirements of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 in that it considered all the necessary elements before sentencing defendant. Defendant was sentenced to less than one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment allowed for forgery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widow brought wrongful death and survival claims against defendant department of transportation (DOT) that arose out of a car accident in which her husband was killed. The Thirty-Eighth Judicial District Court, Parish of Cameron (Louisiana), found the husband 25 percent at fault and assigned the remaining 75 percent to DOT. The court reduced the award to comport with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5106. Both DOT and the wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband's truck struck an area of ponded water, causing him to lose control of his truck, slide across the highway through a ditch, and come to rest under a tree limb. The branch of the tree sheared off the top of the truck, piercing the passenger compartment. DOT asserted, inter alia, that the jury erred in concluding that the roadway and shoulder defects created an unreasonable risk of harm and that it had prior notice of any such defects, and it erred in its apportionment of fault. The wife sought a declaration that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:5106, 13:5112, were unconstitutional on the grounds that they violated the Louisiana Constitution's Equal Protection Clause, Sovereign Immunity Clause, and Access to Courts Clause. The appellate court found no manifest error in the jury's credibility determinations and conclusion that the roadway-shoulder variance created an unreasonable risk of harm; that DOT had actual or constructive notice of the defect and failed to take corrective measures within a reasonable time; the record supported that DOT should bear the majority of the fault; and, reluctantly, that the statutes were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The employee returned and worked from 1995 until he resigned/retired in 1997. The employee argued that the job he had performed for two years did not comply with his physician's limitations. The trial court awarded additional benefits, finding the employee had not retired within the meaning of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1221(3)(d)(ii). Workers' compensation benefits were paid to the employee from 1994 until 1999, including 104 weeks of benefits after the employee had retired. The record convinced the appellate court that the employee permanently withdrew from the work force, as he announced to his co-workers that he was retiring and considered himself retired. The appellate court found no evidence in the record that the employee intended to return to work and the record did not reasonably support the trial court's conclusion that the employee had not permanently withdrew from the workforce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant pled guilty to possession with the intent to distribute cocaine, and was sentenced pursuant to the plea agreement. The State subsequently filed a habitual offender bill of information, alleging that the defendant was a fourth-felony offender. The 24th Judicial District Court, Jefferson Parish (Louisiana), sentenced the defendant to 20 years at hard labor, concurrent with the defendant's other sentences. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At sentencing, the State argued that the defendant was subject to life imprisonment under the version of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15: 529.1A(1)(c)(ii) in effect at the time of the commission of the offense controlled. The trial judge disagreed and applied the version in effect at the time of sentencing. On appeal, the State argued that the trial judge erred in failing to impose the mandatory sentence pursuant to the law in effect at the time of the commission of the underlying offense. The appellate court agreed and vacated the sentence. Under the habitual offender statute as it existed at the time of the commission of the offense, the defendant was subject to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Under the amended version, the defendant was not subject to mandatory life imprisonment. The court held that the general rule that the law in effect at the time of the commission of the offense was determinative of the penalty controlled the defendant's sentencing. Therefore, the trial judge erred in giving the amended statute retroactive application in sentencing the defendant. The sentence was illegally lenient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant's sentence was vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed all suits except one taxpayer's challenge to certain tax payments, and all the taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged assessed valuations. The appellate court held the trial court's dismissals of six of the taxpayers' suits were final and appealable, but a judgment overruling an exception was interlocutory and not appealable. Only the trial court could address the taxpayers' requests for sanctions under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 863. When the appellate court ruled a taxpayer's constitutional challenge did not prescribe while, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1856(D), it awaited the tax commission's decision, it did not direct the commission to rule on the constitutional issue. The taxpayers' constitutional challenge filed before the tax commission's final decision was not premature because the commission had no authority to decide that challenge. The trial court did not have to grant mandamus directing the commission to transfer the taxpayers' constitutional challenge to the trial court because the commission could still enter a final judgment on the taxpayers' other claims. The trial court did not exercise appellate jurisdiction over the tax commission in the taxpayers' declaratory judgment actions, so it could not issue supervisory writs in those actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment sustaining an exception raising the objection of prematurity was reversed. Otherwise, the trial court's judgment was affirmed. One taxpayer's appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant construction company sued appellee law firm in the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Iberia Parish (Louisiana), for legal malpractice. The trial court granted the law firm's exception of prescription/peremption, and the company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The construction company alleged the firm was negligent for not timely filing a bankruptcy claim. The appellate court held La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5605, which was the current law applicable to prescription of legal malpractice actions, referred to one-year and three-year periods, both of which were peremptive. Nothing could interfere with the running of these peremptive periods, such as contra non valentem or the continuous representation rule, and they could not be renounced. While, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5605(E), the three-year period was inapplicable if fraud was proved, the one-year period still applied. Because the company's claim was perempted on the face of its petition, it had the burden of showing its claim was not perempted, and it did not meet that burden.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5605(A) imposed a discovery exception on the one-year peremptive period, but the company knew or should have known of its claim more than one year before the action was filed. Due to the inapplicability of the continuous representation rule, the date of termination of the company's attorney-client relationship with the firm was a non-issue. The statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found there was sufficient evidence to support his burglary conviction. His counsel was not ineffective for failing to introduce medical evidence that he was physically unable to run and jump, in light of the evidence against him. In defendant's multiple offender prosecution, the State met its burden of showing he was advised of his rights when he pled guilty to a prior offense, by introducing a guilty plea/waiver of rights form signed and initialed by defendant, as well as his counsel and the trial judge, and the docket master and minute entry, both showing defendant was represented by counsel. While defendant's minimum mandatory sentence could be unconstitutionally excessive, it was presumed constitutional. Defendant, who had a lengthy criminal record, did not meet his burden of rebutting the presumption that his mandatory minimum sentence was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sued defendant city, the employee's former employer, seeking recovery of compensation for unused leave. The Fifteenth Judicial District, Parish of Vermilion, Louisiana, found in favor of the employee and awarded him $ 24,297 as compensation for unused leave in addition to attorney's fees. The trial court also denied the city's peremptory exception of no cause of action and its reconventional demand. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During his employment with the city, the employee was a member of the city's civil service system. After he was terminated for cause, the employee appealed his termination to the city's civil service board, which amended the termination to a suspension without pay for 28 days and ordered the reinstatement of the employee. The employee was then placed on administrative leave and paid his full salary. During the period he was on administrative leave, the employee performed no labor or services for the city. The trial court later ordered the reinstatement of the decision terminating the employee. The employee then sued the city for compensation for his unused leave. The city argued the employee forfeited any unused leave because he was terminated. The employee alleged he was entitled to be paid for unused leave under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:631 et. seq. In affirming the trial court's decision, the appeals court concluded there was no clear written policy that leave earned by an employee was a mere gratuity. Consequently, the trial court was correct in finding the employee was entitled to be compensated for unused leave since it was a wage under the law.</SPAN></P>

Supervised visitation was to continue until the ex-husband successfully completed a treatment program for perpetrators of family violence prescribed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:364(C). Upon completion of the program, the ex-husband demanded joint custody of the parties' child or, alternatively, unsupervised visitation. The district court restored the ex-husband's normal visitation and awarded the ex-wife attorney fees plus interest. The ex-husband protested paying the award of attorney fees after having won unsupervised visitation. On appeal, the court found that (1) the attorney fees under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the State elicited testimony from a woman whose car had been stolen days before the robbery. Specifically, the woman testified the car used in the robbery belonged to her, that it was stolen, and that gloves used in the robbery were found in the car when defendant was arrested in possession of the vehicle. On appeal, defendant argued the trial court erred by denying him a mistrial after the prosecutor used the car owner's testimony. Specifically, he argued the mention of the stolen car constituted impermissible other crimes evidence. Defendant also contended his life sentence was unconstitutionally excessive. The appellate court noted that generally evidence of other crimes was inadmissible because of the risk of grave prejudice to a defendant. The appellate court held even if the testimony was other crimes' evidence, it did not unambiguously point to defendant as the perpetrator of the car theft; thus, the trial court properly denied a mistrial. The appellate court concluded defendant's life sentence was a statutory mandatory minimum sentence and that he failed to rebut the presumption of the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Generally, in order to preserve an alleged error for consideration on appeal, La. Code Crim. Proc.

When the language of the statute was read in conjunction with a review of the history of the amendments to the statute, it was clear that the legislature intended to encompass areas such as public parks and recreational areas that were not within school boundaries. The appellate court found that the statute was not vague and was sufficiently clear and unambiguous to inform a person that violators were exposed to enhanced penalties when they engaged in prohibited conduct involving controlled dangerous substances in parks or recreational areas.</SPAN></P>

He contended that the recreational park was not property used for school purposes and, thus, did not fall within the areas addressed by and defined in the statute. He further argued that the Louisiana Legislature did not intend to include government-owned recreational areas that were not part of school property, as such areas were not specifically addressed in a separate subsection of the statute, as were drug treatment, religious, and public housing authority buildings and facilities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, for aggravated rape of a juvenile under the age of 12. The trial court denied his motions to quash the indictment and to discover and exclude hypnotically refreshed testimony, and defendant sought a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The crime charged in the indictment occurred 20 years before it was issued. At the time of the offense, it was a capital crime, and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 571 provided no prescriptive period for capital offenses. Imposition of the death penalty for this crime was found to be cruel and unusual punishment. The appellate court held that, even though the death penalty was not an available punishment, the associated procedural rules were still in effect, as no legislative action indicated an intention to change the lack of a prescriptive period for this offense. The exception to La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 510(C)(1), for child abuse prosecutions, giving the victim a privilege to refuse to disclose communications with her therapist, did not apply. If there was not significant prejudicial evidence induced by hypnosis, the victim's testimony was admissible, despite her hypnosis. The trial court's ruling that there was no indication the victim was hypnotized was based on a mistake of fact, requiring remand for an evidentiary hearing to allow defendant to inquire of the victim's therapist on this subject.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the victim's hypnosis. Otherwise, writs were denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile court appointed the attorney to represent a child alleged to be in need of care. The attorney submitted a request for payment to the department.

The attorney filed a motion to compel payment of attorney's fees and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in the prosecution of the motion. On appeal, the department argued the clear language of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46:460.21A(1) resulted in the attorney's representation being provided pro bono. The appellate court found the trial court exercised its constitutional authority to ensure fair proceedings when it ordered the department to pay the attorney. Accordingly, the appellate court concluded the trial court did not err in ordering the department to pay the attorney's legal fees. However, the appellate court found the amount the trial court awarded did not comport with the amount of attorney's fees either requested by the attorney or approved by the trial court, and the trial court erred in awarding reasonable attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate appealed the judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which sustained its own exception of no cause of action and signed a judgment in favor of defendants, secretary of state corrections department and warden of correctional institute, dismissing the inmate's suit which challenged the institute's system for access to its law library.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court determined that because the inmate asserted no claim of actual injury or harm that had resulted from his limited access to the prison library, his petition stated merely a grievance against the prison system that addressed itself exclusively to the administration of the prison; it did not set forth a claim of deprivation of a constitutionally protected right. As such, the appellate court found the inmate's complaint about the prison's call-out procedure for library access was not the type of claim traditionally cognizable in a trial court, and thus was not a &quot;civil matter&quot; reserved for the trial court. Accordingly, because the administrative remedies set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1171 et seq. provided the exclusive remedy available to the inmate for the type of grievance presented, the appellate court concluded his grievance should have been processed through administrative channels before being reviewed by the trial court. Therefore, the appellate court concluded the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the inmate's claim and its judgment sustaining the exception of no cause of action was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the inmate's petition but vacated the portion of the trial court's judgment that sustained an exception of no cause of action and assessed costs to the inmate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Criminal District Court of Orleans Parish (Louisiana) of attempted possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute. The trial court sentenced him to two years' imprisonment at hard labor and fined him. The trial court granted defendant's motion for appeal. Pursuant to a multiple bill, the defendant was re-sentenced as a triple offender to two years at hard labor with credit for time served.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arresting officers approached defendant and four other men who were loitering. The officers saw defendant leave the other men, throw something over a fence, and return to the group. The officers secured the men and retrieved the object defendant had discarded, a bag of crack cocaine. On appeal, the court found that the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence because (1) the object was discarded by defendant without police interference, and, therefore, the officers could retrieve it; (2) defendant had no expectation of privacy; (3) the abandonment gave the officers reasonable suspicion -- sufficient articulable knowledge of particular facts and circumstances -- to justify detaining defendant; and (4) once the object was retrieved, and it appeared to be crack cocaine, the officers had probable cause to arrest, as facts and circumstances within their knowledge, based on reasonable and trustworthy information, justified a belief that defendant had committed a crime. However, the trial court erred by failing to sentence defendant to life as a third felony offender without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), one defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and sentenced to five years at hard labor, while the other defendant was convicted of simple possession of cocaine and sentenced to two years at hard labor. They appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sold crack cocaine from a street corner, in plain view of the arresting officers. The appellate court held the officers had probable cause to arrest and search defendants. At one defendant's sentencing, no reasons for his minimum mandatory sentence were stated. Because the trial court imposed the lowest possible sentence, there was no reason to require compliance with the provisions of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, calling for a statement of the reasons for a sentence, as the sentence was statutorily mandated. There was no evidence rebutting the presumption that defendant's minimum mandatory sentence was constitutional. The trial court did not enunciate the requirement of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967B(4)(b) that at least the first five years of defendant's sentence be served without the benefit of parole. Under the self-activating provision of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:301.1A, as well as La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 882, the appellate court could recognize that five years of defendant's sentence were to be served without benefit of parole, as the trial court had no discretion regarding this condition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One defendant's sentence was modified to provide that its first five years would be served without benefit of parole, and, as amended, defendants' convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Martin (Louisiana), entered a final judgment of convictions after a jury found defendant guilty of manslaughter in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:31(A)(1) and aggravated battery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two acquaintances attempted to visit the home of defendant's girlfriend and child. While at the home, they were harassed by three neighborhood men. An altercation turned physical and caused defendant to retreat. When defendant and one acquaintance returned later, they were approached by the same three men. One of the men, a man of considerable size, approached the acquaintance. One of the other men left and returned with a bat. In short, the evidence indicated defendant was presented with a quickly escalating situation. While the evidence indicated defendant may have had sufficient time to retreat or sound a warning, he instead further escalated the confrontation by firing shots and killing the large man that had approached the acquaintance. The men then scattered, but a neighborhood man walking by froze. Defendant then shot that man twice. After defendant was convicted on two charges, the appellate court found the evidence was sufficient to support both convictions. Even though conflicts existed in witness's testimony, it was for the trier of fact, not the appellate court, to resolve those conflicts, and the jury's resolution was not irrational.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed and the matter was remanded to inform defendant of post-conviction relief deadlines.</SPAN></P>

The Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, sentenced him to eight and one-half years at hard labor, but conditionally court suspended two years of the sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the early morning hours, an officer spotted a car partially hidden between two dumpsters behind a closed bank, in an area where burglaries recently occurred. He asked defendant why he was parked behind the building at that hour. A second officer saw an ATM card on the ground near defendant's car; defendant denied any knowledge of the card. From a phone call to the issuer of the card, the officer learned it had been stolen; he called the card's owner, who described the man who had robbed her hours before. Her description matched defendant; some clothing she described was found in his car. The appellate court held that, after finding the card near defendant's vehicle, and learning it had been stolen, the officers had reasonable suspicion of a crime sufficient to justify a Terry stop. Reasonable suspicion ripened into probable cause for arrest when the officer spoke to the victim and heard her describe the robber. The suppression motion was thus properly denied. But the trial court erred in suspending a portion of defendant's sentence, as suspension of a sentence in a first degree robbery conviction violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64.1(B).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed, but the case was remanded to the trial court for re-sentencing and to advise defendant of the two-year prescriptive period for filing an application for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, denied defendant's motion to suppress and his oral motion in limine regarding identification evidence. He was convicted of 2 counts of armed robbery and sentenced to 2 concurrent terms of 49.5 years' imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. He was then found to be a third-felony offender and sentenced to life imprisonment. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An armed man approached a couple in a car at 2:00 a.m. An unarmed man then approached. The woman of the couple let him in. He demanded money and frisked her. She gave him her keys. The couple got out and the robbers fled. Police soon responded and the couple gave descriptions. Within 2 hours, police drove the couple within 25 feet of a suspect. The couple identified defendant as the unarmed robber. At trial, the woman testified that the area of the robbery was well lit and that she saw defendant during the robbery for a few seconds. The appellate court found that defendant failed to prove that the &quot;show-up&quot; identification's suggestiveness created a very substantial likelihood of misidentification. The trial court did not err in not admitting a transcript of the woman's recorded description into evidence. It had been used to refresh her memory and not for impeachment purposes. Thus her testimony, not the transcript, was the evidence. As to one apparent discrepancy between the male victim's trial testimony and transcript, the defense took no further steps to impeach.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to felony theft of property between $ 100 and $ 500 and was sentenced to two years' hard labor. The State filed an information alleging that defendant was a fourth felony offender, and sought a life sentence pursuant to former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(c)(ii). Defendant admitted that he had committed the alleged offenses but argued that the imposition of a life sentence would be unconstitutionally excessive as the offenses involved drugs and theft to obtain drugs. The trial court agreed and resentenced defendant to 20 years hard labor. Defendant argued that the trial court had not advised him of his right to a hearing and to remain silent, as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(D)(1)(a), (3), and that the 20 year sentence was excessive. The appellate court held that the fact that defendant was advised of the right to a hearing by his counsel was sufficient to comply with the statute. Any failure to advise defendant of the right to remain silent was harmless. The trial court had properly found a life sentence would have been excessive and departed downward. The sentence imposed was not constitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

The individual and corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner complained numerous times to police about noise coming from the individual and corporation's nightclub. Citations were issued to the individual. He was tried in city court for noise violations. He allegedly was acquitted on all charges. The individual then brought a defamation claim against the property owner for making allegedly unfounded complaints. The property owner moved to strike pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 971, enacted two months after the individual and corporation's suit was filed. The law allowed a defendant to seek dismissal of a claim asserted against him for exercising his petition or free speech rights. Eventually, denial of the motion was reversed and the defamation and constitutional claims were dismissed. After attorney fees and costs were awarded to the property owner pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 971B, the appellate court found that applying that provision to award such fees and costs was error. It found that since the provision changed the law by creating a new obligation to pay fees and costs, the provision was substantive and could not be applied retroactively to award attorney fees and costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence and a confession. Defendant then pled guilty to simple burglary and he was sentenced to eight years at hard labor as a third-felony offender. Defendant appealed. Defense counsel filed an Anders brief and requested to withdraw as counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant argued the trial court erred in finding probable cause at the preliminary hearing because he did not commit the crime. The appellate court found that even if this position was tenable, the issue was moot. Defendant claimed that he did not remove the items from the car but found them on the street while the State presented a strong basis for believing defendant committed the criminal act in question. Thus, the appellate court found defendant's plea satisfied the Alford requirements in that there was a strong factual showing for the plea. However, it also found that the trial court erred when it sentenced defendant to serve eight years without benefit of probation or suspension as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:574.4 required that defendant's eligibility for parole should be left to the determination of the department of corrections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed and his sentence was amended to delete that portion of the eight-year sentence prohibiting probation eligibility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by a grand jury indictment with first degree murder. He was jointly indicted with another, who was at large at the time of defendant's trial. The Criminal District Court Orleans Parish (Louisiana), after a jury trial, convicted defendant of second degree murder. His motion for new trial was denied. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A man's body was found in the street. Police found his apartment two weeks later; defendant and a woman and her 14-year old daughter were inside, along with an apparently bloodstained sofa. A search warrant was later executed; the apartment appeared to have been cleaned, but bloody items were recovered. Defendant denied the killing. Three years later, the daughter was found in Mississippi with an unrelated criminal suspect, and was put in a mental institution. Meanwhile, defendant had not tried to hide. The daughter gave a new, detailed statement that blamed her mother and defendant for the planned killing. The appellate court found that as defendant had not received the death penalty, he had no valid Witherspoon complaints. Prospective jurors with health problems, and one with a likely attention problem, were properly dismissed. A burned car found near the homicide scene one day later, which a police report linked to a homicide, was irrelevant. The trial court's disallowance of development of testimony on whether the daughter had known of a warrant for her arrest was harmless error, as was the prosecutor's marginal appeal to the jury as potential crime victims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's sentences for theft and simple burglary were vacated and his case was remanded for resentencing, the Twelfth Judicial District Court, Parish of Avoyelles (Louisiana), consolidated the offenses. He was adjudicated a second felony offender, and sentenced to an effective term of 42 years in prison. His motion for reconsideration was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant committed various thefts and two simple burglary offenses. He was found guilty on all counts. He was then adjudicated and sentenced as a third habitual offender. The appellate court later vacated all sentences and remanded for resentencing. The trial court consolidated the offenses for resentencing. Defendant was determined to be only a second felony offender. The trial court imposed six sentences of seven years each, to run consecutive to each other, and without benefit of parole. It then imposed a seventh sentence to run concurrent with any other sentence. In a minute entry two years later, it attempted to amend one sentence. After the sentences were imposed and defendant's motion for reconsideration was denied, the appellate court found the parole restriction could not be imposed on a second felony offender. It also found the minute entry could not be used to amend a sentence already being served. It then found no abuse of sentencing discretion regarding defendant's cumulative 42-year sentence, as he was a career criminal and second felony offender. Finally, it found he should be informed of the two-year time period for requesting postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentences on four separate convictions for theft were affirmed, but the parole eligibility restriction was ordered deleted. An amended sentence on four counts of theft imposed by a minute entry was vacated and an earlier sentence imposed was reinstated. Two sentences, each involving two theft convictions, were remanded for sentencing clarification. An appeal on two counts of simple burglary was dismissed, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

She did nothing to halt her daughter's sexual abuse and, if she were powerless under the circumstances, it was because she chose to be. It could reasonably be found that defendant was one of the worst offenders and merited the maximum sentence, so the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing that term.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee motorist sued appellant state transportation department in the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), for injuries received in his automobile's collision with a concrete abutment on a state highway. The trial court entered judgment for the motorist, and the department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist ran into a bridge abutment that had no guardrail. The appellate court found that, under applicable law, the highway department had to keep the highway in a safe condition, and the requirement of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800, that the state have actual or constructive notice of a defect in order for liability to attach, did not apply. The trial court's finding of fact that the motorist was not responsible for the accident was not clearly erroneous. The weight the trial court gave the motorist's properly qualified experts was not clearly wrong. Once the department rebuilt this part of the highway, its own policies obliged it to place a guardrail in front of the abutment, under the standards of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO); and whether to place the guardrail was no longer discretionary or immune, but was non-discretionary and subject to a duty/risk analysis of liability. Under that analysis, the department was liable for the motorist's injuries. While the department did not have to bring an old highway up to AASHTO standards, it had a duty to correct this unreasonably hazardous condition on the old highway.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The substantive right to allocate fault was created in 1979 with the introduction of comparative fault. As such, 1996 La. Acts 3 simply delineated a method for enforcing that substantive right as particularly applied to a statutory employer. Because the legislative changes in Act 3 were procedural, they could be applied retroactively. The employee did not have a substantive right to have a non-party's fault assigned to the parties who were found at fault.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two police officers were in a neighborhood with a high rate of narcotics activity. One officer observed defendant engage in a hand-to-hand transaction. When the officers drove up to defendant, he fled.

When he caught defendant, defendant hit the police officer. When the other officer arrived he hit defendant in the stomach and a rock of crack cocaine flew out of defendant's mouth. On appeal, the court found (1) the trial court was correct to deny defendant's suppression motion because the officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop; (2) the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to strike the all-white jury panel because defendant failed to meet his burden of showing that African-Americans were systematically excluded from the jury selection process; (3) a proper foundation was laid for the admission of the cocaine into evidence; and (4) the multiple offender enhancement was improper because there was a failure to prove the expiration of the cleansing period between the predicates and the instant offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial in the Third Judicial District Court for the Parish of Lincoln, Louisiana, defendant was convicted of aggravated incest, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:78.1, for his act of raping his 14-year-old daughter. Defendant was adjudicated a third-felony offender and was sentenced to life imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal, inter alia, that the trial court erred in (1) denying his challenge for cause to a prospective juror who expressed problems with the standards for the case; (2) denying his motion for a mistrial where a witness referred to defendant having been in jail; (3) admitting a judgment of paternity; (4) adjudicating him a third-felony offender where a predicate offense was based on a defective guilty plea; and (5) imposing an unconstitutionally excessive sentence. The appellate court held that the challenge to the juror was properly denied, as the juror ultimately expressed his ability to make a decision based on the evidence and the law. The refusal to grant a mistrial was not an abuse of discretion, as the jail reference was not an unambiguous reference to another crime. The paternity judgment was properly admitted, as it was relevant and probative and fell within a La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 803 hearsay exception. The guilty plea underlying the challenged predicate offense was voluntary and was not defective. The mandatory sentence was tailored to defendant's culpability and defendant failed to rebut the presumption of the sentence's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the conviction; defendant's adjudication as a third-felony offender; and defendant's sentence of life imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>

The victim and her friend were able to identify defendant from a photo lineup provided by the police. They also testified that they were familiar with defendant before this incident and identified him. On appeal, the court found (1) the State sustained its burden to negate the possibility of misidentification, and the evidence from the women's testimony established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) there was no suggestiveness in the pictures or the procedures used for conducting a photographic lineup, so misidentification of defendant was unlikely; (3) defendant's prior guilty pleas to felonies were properly used to show defendant's predicate offenses as a habitual offender; and (4) defendant failed to rebut the presumption that his mandatory life sentence was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ordered the trial court to determine defendant's multiple offender status. The public defender was appointed to represent defendant on the morning of the hearing. The trial court denied his continuance request even though he unfamiliar with the case. The State did not present documentation of defendant's multiple offender status, but he was still sentenced to prison time. After he was sentenced, the appellate court found he was not prejudiced by the sentencing delay. It also found the evidence supported his conviction. However, it further held the failure to grant the continuance meant he was denied effective assistance of counsel and the State had to present multiple offender documentation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pled guilty to a reduced charge of one count of possession of cocaine in excess of 28 grams and not more than 200 grams. The Sixteenth Judicial District Court, St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, sentenced him to 35 years at hard labor to run concurrent with a 15-year sentence he received for a plea in federal court for violations based on identical facts to the state proceedings. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant complained that his sentence was unconstitutionally excessive and that the State's prosecution of charges under the Louisiana criminal statute constituted double jeopardy because he was also prosecuted for similar violations under federal criminal law as a result of the same arrest. The appellate court found that other than the federal court felony plea, defendant had no prior felonies. Furthermore, several witnesses detailed defendant's cooperation with federal authorities and local law enforcement agencies in solving other cases. Contrary to the trial court's observations, the record was devoid of any proof of the possibility or probability of recidivism by defendant. The appellate court concluded that 35-year sentence imposed by the trial court shocked its sense of justice. Under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 597, the prosecution of charges under both state and federal criminal statutes did not place defendant in jeopardy of being prosecuted twice for the same crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed, the sentence was vacated, and the case was remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by bill of information with possession of crack cocaine, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(C). A six-person jury, before the Criminal District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, found him guilty as charged, and the State charged him as a third-felony habitual offender. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer detained defendant, while another officer retrieved a small plastic bag containing crack cocaine. Defendant was placed under arrest and advised of his rights. Subsequently, he informed the officers that he was a drug user, not a drug seller, and further admitted that the cocaine belonged to him. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(b)(ii), when the third felony or either one of the two prior felony convictions is a felony defined as a crime of violence under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;14:2(13) the only sentence was life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence. Nevertheless, the district court was aware that the second felony conviction was for defendant's possession of a crack pipe. As to the first felony conviction, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted sexual battery, which, at the time defendant was sentenced, was not defined as a crime of violence. Further, the district court failed to state for the record that it was a crime of violence. This required reconsideration of the sentence pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the conviction, but remanded the matter for the sentence to be reconsidered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon remand to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty pleas, the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, after a jury trial, convicted him of three counts of first degree robbery. The State filed a habitual offender bill of information, and defendant received 2 10-year sentences and an enhanced 20-year sentence, all consecutive. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Witnesses identified defendant as a robber with a wig, cap, and glasses. An officer testified that such things, and also a toy revolver and money which could not be traced to the second bank robbed, were recovered from defendant's apartment. A teller robbed in the second bank testified that she neither saw a weapon nor did defendant's use of his hands indicate that he had a gun, but that she assumed from what he had said that he had one, and she immediately complied with his demand. The appellate court found the evidence sufficient to show a subjective belief on that teller's part that defendant was armed with a dangerous weapon, which belief was objectively reasonable given that others either saw his hand move under his shirt or what one teller believed was a gun. The State satisfied its State v. Prieur burden for admission of similar-plan evidence of a later &quot;wig&quot; bank robbery where defendant's fingerprints were found. The trial court had discretion to sentence consecutively, despite the presumption for concurrence, as to the two robberies in the second bank. The sentence was not vindictive despite exceeding the sentence for which he originally plea-bargained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Twenty-Second Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Tammany, Louisiana, dismissed appellant former client's demands alleging legal malpractice against appellee attorney as untimely. The former client appealed and challenged the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5605.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former client challenged judgment against him, contending that it was error to dismiss his claim, and if the claim was untimely, then the time limitations set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5605 were unconstitutional as applied in his case. Further, the attorney filed a motion seeking to convert his prescription exception to an exception of no cause of action, raising the issue of accrual of the peremptive period. The appeals court, in answering the attorney's motion, held that the former client was well aware that he had lost the case and possibly would also lose it on appeal. The one-year statutorily-imposed time limitation for filing legal malpractice claims thus began to run on the date the jury returned its verdict against him and expired one-year later. Therefore, the court granted the exception of prescription filed by the attorney. Under the facts of this case, the former client could not seek suspension of peremption by insisting on application of continuous representation principles. Because the constitutional issue was not litigated, the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment finding the demands were untimely was affirmed, however the matter was remanded to allow the former client to specially plead the facts supporting his contention that the statute was unconstitutional and for the issue to be fully briefed and litigated.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the hospital district operated in violation of the Open Meetings Law. The hospital district and its executive officer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital district entered into a contract with the anesthesia services provider for the provision of anesthesia services to a hospital. The newly appointed executive officer of the hospital sought to void the contract, which could be voided only for cause by the hospital district. The executive officer voided the contract by letter. The hospital district's board of commissioners affirmed the action following an executive session. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in concluding discussions at the meeting were in violation of the Louisiana Open Meetings Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:4.1 et seq. The executive session fulfilled the stated purpose of the Louisiana Enhanced Ability to Compete Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 46:1070-46:1076, because the discussions of the board regarding the viability of the contract constituted part of the hospital's plan to continue to provide anesthesia services to its patients and were certainly related to the hospital's ability to protect its competitive edge in the health care market.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court for consideration and a ruling on the constitutionality of the Louisiana Enhanced Ability to Compete Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had a contract to transport clients for a social welfare program.

After judgment was entered, defendant argued the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions, that the trial court improperly charged the deadlocked jury, that the trial court failed to remove a juror for cause, that a Batson violation occurred, that his convictions on both charges violated double jeopardy principles, and that his sentences were excessive. However, the appellate court found the alleged errors were meritless except for the double jeopardy argument. It found that because the same evidence was used to convict on both charges, double jeopardy principles applied and the remedy was to vacate the conviction on the lesser sentence, the theft.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction and sentence for theft were vacated, but the judgment of conviction and sentence for forgery were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the Plaquemines 25th Judicial District Court (Louisiana) of distribution of cocaine and sentenced to 17 1/2 years at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. The trial court granted defendant's oral motion for appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that: (1) his sentence was excessive; (2) the trial court erred by sentencing him to serve the first five years of his sentence without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence; (3) he had ineffective assistance of counsel; and (4) the trial court erred by allowing the admissibility of the photo line-up absent evidence of a physical description of the suspect and proper foundation. Defendant failed to prove the trial judge abused the liberal discretion allowed in sentencing. He also failed to rebut the presumption that the sentence was constitutional. Defendant committed the underlying offense on October 17, 1997. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant benefits for the first five years of his sentence. It could not be determined from the record if defense counsel was entitled to know the identity of the confidential informant, and therefore if his failure to call the informant as a defense witness rose to the level of ineffective assistance. The detective's testimony alone was sufficient to establish that any corrupting effect the line-up may have had was outweighed by the Manson factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 14th Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana), by jury, convicted defendant of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. He was adjudicated an habitual offender and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. On appeal, his appellate counsel's Anders brief failed to satisfy certain requirements and a new brief was ordered. Both a new Anders brief and defendant's pro se brief were filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police were informed defendant was selling crack from his residence. Police got and executed a search warrant and found crack, among other places, under a couch defendant was sitting on. At trial, an officer testified that the amount found was not consistent with mere personal use. The appellate court found that defendant had constructive possession of the narcotics. He had access to where the crack was found and was closer to it than the other two people in the residence. Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims were more appropriately pursued in post-conviction proceedings. The reasonable doubt jury instructions, stating that reasonable doubt was doubt based upon reason and common sense, and considered in their totality, were not likely to have been misapplied by the jury. The trial court issued reasons for the sentence, commented upon mitigators, and sentenced defendant to the minimum sentence allowable. Thus the sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was deemed to contain a provision indicating that the first five years were to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a union member, was allegedly employed by defendant employer. She was then laid off. She received vacation pay, owed to her as a result of the collective bargaining agreement, in a lump sum payment which covered the next two months. The employee filed for unemployment benefits. The administrative law judge (ALJ) found the employee was eligible to receive a certain amount per week in benefits. Her vacation pay, when prorated, exceeded that weekly benefit amount. Since the vacation pay was treated as wages under the applicable statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1601(7)(d), the ALJ denied her claim for benefits. After the trial court affirmed, the appellate court found the statute was not ambiguous. While it was true the title and preamble of the related bill showed an intent not to count vacation pay received pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement as wages, the title and preamble were not part of the law and the statute's enacted version only showed that vacation pay should be counted as wages. The appellate court also found the statute was not unconstitutional and the federal ERISA law was not related to nor did it regulate the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant led police to the 76-year-old victim's smoldering body. She admitted plotting with a man to &quot;set up&quot; the victim to rob her, but claimed that this man killed the victim and set fire to her corpse. Trial evidence showed that the victim died of suffocation consistent with her mouth and nose being covered with duct tape, and that defendant had forged the victim's signature on checks which she cashed. The appellate court held that the prosecutor had not improperly referred to earlier forgeries by defendant in his opening statement. A pathologist's opinion that the victim was killed was not an improper opinion that defendant was guilty. The jury instructions were not confusing. The evidence was sufficient to convict. Allegedly gruesome photos of the victim's corpse were properly admitted to explain the pathologist's conclusion that suffocation, not burning, was the cause of death. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to preserve for review the claim that defendant's life sentence was excessive, because it was not. The appellate court allowed the State to supplement the record with videotapes of defendant's statements, as they were sufficiently identified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee mother, on behalf of herself and her minor child, sued appellant, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD), alleging that a defective intersection caused an auto accident in which the mother and her child were injured, and her other child was killed. The Eleventh Judicial District, Parish of Sabine, Louisiana, rendered judgment that the DODT was 100 percent liable for the accident. The DODT appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the mother was waiting to make a left turn, another driver changed lanes, and struck the mother's vehicle from behind, pushing into oncoming traffic. The mother and her two children were injured; one child died of her injuries. The appellate court held that the trial's court's viewing of the scene of the accident was not an abuse of discretion, as it did so to better visualize the scene, and did not conduct experiments or take measurements. While the trial court erred in requiring the mother to prove notice, this error did not harm the DODT. The trial court did not err in finding the DOTD at fault for the accident, as the evidence showed that the highway created an unreasonable risk of harm to a left-turning motorist. However, it was error to assess 100 percent of the fault to the DODT, as the other driver had switched lanes without ensuring that it was safe to do so. The award of $ 750,00 in mental distress damages to the mother was not supported by the evidence, and was reduced. As there was no evidence that the child remembered the accident, the award to her of damages for mental distress was also reversed. The remaining damage awards were supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the judgment finding the DOTDT to be 100 percent at fault was reversed, and the DOTD was assessed with 80 percent of the fault, and the non-party driver was assessed with 20 percent of the fault. The damage award to the mother for mental distress was reduced from $ 750,000 to $ 200,000. The damage award to the child for mental distress was reversed. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

One evening, the woman left him with them for a couple hours. The next morning the baby was listless. She was treated intensively by a pediatric intensive care doctor and neurosurgeon who diagnosed her with shaken baby syndrome. She did not return to normal and died from her head injuries about four months later. The woman testified that only she and defendant had primary responsibility for the victim's care, the victim had no bad falls or accidents or bumps that indicated such, defendant would become angry with the victim and deal with her in disturbing ways, and the victim cried on seeing defendant. Others testified of defendant's violent tendencies and guilty conscience. Of 24 baby photos introduced, 17 were from before the injury. The appellate court held that the circumstantial evidence was sufficient. The 17 photos were corroborative of testimony, and, in a sense, not cumulative.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence supported reversal on the grounds of entrapment. Defendant stopped the police officers, approached the vehicle asking what was needed, and did not hesitate to offer his services once he knew that the officers wanted drugs. Defendant did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was induced to obtain drugs. Thus, there was no entrapment. The trial judge sentenced defendant to seven years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. As La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967 B(4)(b) read at the time of the offense, the prohibition of parole, probation, and a suspended sentence could be applied only to the first five years of the sentence. Clearly, the sentence was illegal in part. The trial court considered that defendant had been referred to a diversionary program for a 1996 arrest for possession of cocaine. Defendant had previously been arrested and had been ordered to participate in the About Face Program of Orleans Parish Prison and complete a substance abuse program. Defendant failed to prove the trial judge abused the liberal discretion allowed in sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that claimant had forfeited benefits because claimant denied prior injuries during visits with physicians, in response to interrogatories, and at a deposition. However, evidence revealed prior hospitalizations resulting from work-related injuries and a fight. Claimant also failed to reveal that he had been placed on light duty with a previous employer.

The trial court found the jury understated the amount of damages to which the patient was entitled. On appeal, the court found (1) the fund did not have the standing to raise the issue of prescription/peremption under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628; (2) neither the judge nor the jury abused its discretion in rendering the awards for mental anguish and physical pain and suffering; (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to admit evidence which would have rendered the fund's admission to the act which caused the Hepatitis-C meaningless; and (4) the trial court did not err in granting the JNOV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmates sued appellee Attorney General of the State of Louisiana (AG) and others in the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, seeking, among other relief, a declaration that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 413(B) was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the AG from the suit and the inmates appealed. While the appeal was pending, the inmates filed a motion to remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates alleged that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 413(B) was unconstitutional because it resulted in a racially discriminatory method of selection of grand jury forepersons. The AG filed an exception on the grounds that the inmates had no cause of action against the AG's office when challenging the constitutionality of a state statute. The trial court granted the exception but allowed the inmates to amend the petition. The inmates deleted the AG from the pleadings but continued to serve pleadings on the AG's office. On motion of the AG, and with the apparent agreement of the inmates, the trial court formally dismissed the AG from the action. One of the inmates, however, filed an appeal. The appellate court held that the inmates had not demonstrated any prejudice resulting from the dismissal of the AG from the action. The State remained a party to the action and remanding the case to the trial court as requested to allow the inmates to further amend their petition would not change that fact. The court would not consider the inmate's challenge to the trial court's award of costs against the inmates because the inmate had not briefed the issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Juvenile Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, terminated a mother and father's parental rights to a child because a sibling died due to abuse and neglect while in the parents' care. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents argued that a mere finding of negligence on their part was legally insufficient to terminate their parental rights under La. Child. Code art. 1015(3). The trial judge found more than mere negligence. Hospital records showed that the sibling had bruising on her abdomen. The sibling was denied consistent and appropriate medical treatment. The mother admitted that the household was dirty and chaotic with 18 people in two bedrooms. The coroner's report showed that the immediate cause of the sibling's death was two skull fractures inconsistent with a fall. One of the fractures was depressed, indicating the use of an extreme amount of force. The trial judge was reasonable in deciding that the child would not be safe in the care of either of her parents. The trial judge bent over backwards to protect the father's right against self-incrimination. The parents failed to raise the issue in the trial court of the constitutionality of La. Child. Code art. 1015(3) because the statute did not require a showing that the child was in danger, so the issue was not considered on appeal. The clear and convincing evidence standard of proof in the statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) for appellees and conditionally granted a new trial. The parish appealed; two family members sought an increased damages award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two persons were killed and two others were seriously injured in the accident, which took place in wet weather conditions on a curve on a parish road. Evidence showed that skid tests on the road three years prior to the accident reflected a very slippery condition, that the road was more slippery during wet weather, and that there had been numerous complaints concerning the road. The parish stipulated that it was feasible to improve the road prior to the accident. The appellate court found that the trial court correctly granted the JNOV with respect to the parish's liability under strict liability and negligence theories. However, the trial court erred in finding that the parish was entirely at fault, as one of the drivers was not reasonably observant of the road conditions. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding damages, but a reduction of 20 percent was necessary based on reallocation of fault. The conditional grant of a new trial was proper as the jury's verdict was not supportable by any fair interpretation of the evidence. The increase in damages requested by a decedent's family members was found not to be warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was amended to reduce each damages award by 20 percent and the judgment was affirmed as amended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, convicted defendant of distribution of cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Subsequently, the trial court found defendant to be a third offender and sentenced him to life imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence on each count with the sentences to be served concurrently. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not have a violent history and did not appear to have significant ties to drug distributors. Defendant could have been supporting a drug addiction with the transaction; she was fairly young, and she was a mother. If defendant did receive a life sentence, any hope for her rehabilitation would vanish, and the taxpayers would have to feed, house, and clothe her for life. On the other hand, it could not be forgotten that defendant had two prior chances to prove herself capable of rehabilitation and had failed. The appellate court was unable to conclude either that defendant's mandatory life sentence was constitutional or that there was clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Therefore, on remand, the district court had to hold a hearing at which defendant could present evidence that she was exceptional, a victim of the legislature's failure to assign sentences that were meaningfully tailored to the culpability of the offender, the gravity of the offense, and the circumstances of the case. Also, defendant did not articulate any facts that suggested that his attorney had a conflict of interest or that counsel's representation was ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction, but vacated the sentence and remanded the case for re-sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization and individuals sued the state and a class represented by the district attorney for Orleans Parish and consisting of all district attorneys throughout the State. The trial court declared certain criminal statutes unconstitutional only insofar as they prohibited non-commercial, consensual, private sexual activity by adult human beings. The court of appeals noted that, under La. Const., art. 5, &sect; 5(D), the Louisiana Supreme Court had jurisdiction over cases in which statutes had been ruled unconstitutional. The state had duly appealed the trial court's findings of unconstitutionality to the supreme court. Therefore, under La.

The court of appeals therefore lacked jurisdiction over the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate filed a petition for judicial review of an administrative decision under the Corrections Administrative Remedy Procedure (CARP) set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:1171 through 1179. The 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, dismissed the petition and the inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate became ill after being exposed to bacteria-contaminated water through the prison water supply system. The inmate filed a CARP complaint seeking money damages and the termination of some prison employees that the inmate alleged had intentionally misled him about the condition of the water supply. The inmate's claim was denied at all administrative levels. The trial court dismissed the inmate's petition for review based on the recommendation of a commissioner who had conducted a review of the record but had not held any other proceedings. The appellate court noted that the trial court had acted prior to the decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court in Pope v. State of Louisiana, which held CARP unconstitutional as applied to inmate tort actions because the statute improperly allowed the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections to exercise original jurisdiction in tort actions in violation of La. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(A). Under Pope, as the inmate's claim was in tort, the trial court should have exercised its original jurisdiction and conducted a trial de novo.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under La. Rev. Stat.

This period did not begin to run until the department was served with process. The trial court entered an ex parte order requiring it to pay the claimant benefits because the administrative record was not filed. There was no evidence in the record that anyone had been served with anything, appellee employer was not given an opportunity for a hearing, and no evidence was introduced. The only benefits awardable for this reason were payable from administrative expense funds not chargeable to the employer, at least until there was a final judicial determination of the claimant's appeal. These payments were unique administrative expenses properly payable from administrative funds under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 23:1511, 23:1513. Although La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to advise him of the post-conviction relief provisions, and in imposing an excessive sentence. Defendant's first conviction was for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, a violation of the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Law, punishable by imprisonment for more than five years. Thus, he received the mandatory life sentence as a third felony habitual offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(b)(ii). The three felonies committed by defendant were simple burglary, possession of cocaine and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. When defendant was sentenced the first time, the trial judge stated that he deemed the life imprisonment term excessive and reduced the sentence accordingly. The record suggested that defendant might not be deserving of the minimum mandatory life sentence provided by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 (A)(1)(b)(ii). The record, however, did not provide enough evidence about defendant for a conclusion as to the constitutionality of the life sentence in his case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate sued defendant attorney general, sheriff, and other government officials and entities in the Thirteenth Judicial District, Parish of Evangeline, Louisiana, seeking damages and a declaration that former La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 413(B) was unconstitutional. The trial court granted exceptions of no cause of action and prescription and dismissed the suit as frivolous. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that the method of selecting grand jury foremen set out in former art. 413(B) was unconstitutional due to racial discrimination. The trial court granted the attorney general's exception of no cause of action on the basis that the attorney general was not an indispensable party to a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute. The appellate court agreed; the attorney general could appear in such suits on a discretionary basis, and allowing the attorney general to be named as a defendant would have removed that discretion. The appellate court also found that the sheriff's exceptions of no cause of action and prescription were properly granted. The inmate's arrest and initial incarceration in the parish in question did not give rise to a claim against the sheriff, and even if a cause of action had been alleged it would have prescribed. The trial court did not err in dismissing the suit as frivolous pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1188 because, contrary to the inmate's argument, the statute was not limited to use by a particular judicial district, nor was it limited to review of administrative rulings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the school district adopted a policy of compensating employees for unused annual leave, it was advised this was unconstitutional and adopted a &quot;use or lose&quot; policy which was never committed to writing. In the absence of a clear, written policy that vacation time was nothing more than a gratuity not to be considered an amount due or wage, the employees' accrued but unused vacation time was a vested right for which they were to be compensated upon discharge or resignation. Prescription did not begin to run until each employee retired, as a claim for unused annual leave would not have been viable prior to that time, so their claims did not prescribe. Awards were properly based on the employees' salaries at the time of retirement. One employee should have been given credit for unused annual leave days the school district admitted he was entitled to. The school district could not rely on an unlawful oral or written policy to deny the employees' claims, so it was liable for statutory penalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving under the influence when he ran over three boys. Defendant fled the scene and was taken into custody some eight hours later. Defendant appealed arguing that the trial court erred by 1) not forcing the judge to recuse himself; 2) admitting into evidence his first DWI conviction because he was not advised of his right to remain silent at the prior proceeding and he was not asked whether he read and understood the guilty plea form; 3) allowing the admission of the blood alcohol test results because they had no probative value and were too remote because the test was administered approximately eight hours after the accident occurred; 4) exposing him to double jeopardy because he was charged with manslaughter based upon a felony DWI that had already been enhanced. The court of appeal found that 1) the judge was not biased; 2) counsel's vague reference to the transcript was not enough to shift the burden of proof back to the State under Boykin; 3) the state relied upon independent evidence to show intoxication and therefore was not required to introduce evidence regarding the blood-alcohol machine or test; and 4) the trial court did subject him to double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for DWI, third offense, was reversed and that sentence vacated. The remaining convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that a guilty plea, resulting in a prior possession of cocaine conviction, should not have been used to enhance his sentence because the State failed to introduce the transcript of the guilty plea. The appeals court disagreed, finding that the State, through the use of the minute entry, met its burden of proof by showing that the defendant was represented by counsel at the time of the plea. Once the State did this, the burden shifted to the defendant to produce some affirmative evidence showing an infringement of his rights or a procedural irregularity, which the defendant did not do. But, the court agreed with defendant that the sentence imposed was constitutionally excessive. No evidence was taken, and the trial court failed to address any of the issues raised by the defendant or to provide any of the factors it used in reaching its decision to deny the defendant's motion for deviation from a third offender sentence. The Louisiana Supreme Court required more than a general conclusion, and because the trial court provided only a general ruling, and did not address the constitutionality of the sentence, remand was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction and third felony offender adjudication were affirmed. However, the sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for re-sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal stayed defendant inmate's appeal from a judgment in forma pauperis from the 19th Judicial District Court, in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1186(F). The court then lifted the stay and ordered the inmate, ex proprio motu, to show cause why this appeal should not be dismissed pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1187.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal ordered the inmate to show cause in light of three judgments which dismissed as frivolous civil actions brought by the inmate in forma pauperis. The court noted that under La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15:1187, no prisoner could bring a civil action or appeal from a civil action or proceeding in forma pauperis if the prisoner had on three or more occasions brought an action that was dismissed on the grounds that it was frivolous, malicious, or failed to state a cause of action or claim upon which relief could be granted. In response to the court's order, the inmate contended that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:1186 and 1187 were unconstitutional. He further argued that the judgments dismissing his three prior suits were null due to application of an unconstitutional standard of review to his federal causes of action. The court held that the constitutionality of the statutes must first have been questioned in the trial court, not the appellate courts, and the unconstitutionality must have been specially pleaded and the grounds for the claim particularized. The inmate had not brought a declaratory action in the district court challenging the constitutionality of the statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the State rested, but before defendant commenced his case, he complained of chest pains. The trial court sent him to a hospital, and continued the trial to the next day. Defendant failed to appear, but the trial continued in his absence. His attorney submitted no evidence other than a proffer of a taped conversation between defendant and a co-defendant. Defendant sought a mistrial on grounds that his absence was due to his medical condition; the trial court refused to grant either a mistrial or a new trial. The appellate court found no error. The trial court found, based on conversations with hospital personnel, that defendant did not have a serious medical condition. The burden then shifted to defendant to show that his medical condition prevented him from appearing. His generic doctor's note, asking that he be excused from work or school, was insufficient. Moreover, defendant told counsel to proceed without him. Defendant was not entitled to a review of his sentence for excessiveness, as he failed to make timely oral or written motions. Because he had been convicted of four felonies and numerous misdemeanors, his sentence was not excessive as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant business owner's application for a video gaming license was granted by a hearing officer and then denied by appellee gaming control board, and he appealed to the 19th Judicial District Court, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, which affirmed the denial. He sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was charged with terrorizing over 10 years before his application. Public record of the charge was expunged under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:9. His application asked if he was ever charged with a criminal offense, regardless of the final outcome, and he said he was not. The application asked if he ever had a criminal record expunged under &sect; 44:9, and he said he had not. An investigation showed the charge. If the owner had been convicted of certain crimes within the previous 10 years, he would have been automatically disqualified, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:310(A). In considering his suitability for a gaming license, the owner's entire criminal history was relevant under &sect; 27:310(B)(2), as was his lack of candor in completing the application. A preponderance of the evidence supported the denial of the owner's application. The state had a legitimate interest in regulating the gaming industry, and its licensing scheme clearly and rationally promoted that interest, so it was not unconstitutional, nor was the owner deprived of due process, since he had no protectable property interest in obtaining a license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 21st Judicial District Court Parish of Tangipahoa, Louisiana, refused to allow defendant to introduce to the jury evidence of the victim's dangerous reputation, by jury convicted him of second degree murder in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1, denied his post-verdict motions, and sentenced him to life in prison at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension or sentence. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's friend was in prison for the murder of defendant's brother. One day the victim got in a conversation with defendant's other brother. Witnesses got the impression that someone was &quot;fixing to get killed.&quot; They saw nothing resembling a weapon in the victim's hands, nor aggressive moves on his part. They saw defendant, off to the side with a gun, shoot the victim, then get over him continuing shooting. No gun was found on the victim. Defendant admitted the shooting claiming that the victim had been reaching for a weapon and that the victim had a reputation for pulling guns on people. After denying defendant's post-verdict motions, the trial court asked his counsel if he was aware of any applicable delays which would prevent sentencing, was told no, and sentenced defendant. The appellate court held that his self-serving, uncorroborated, and contradicted testimony did not constitute appreciable evidence tending to establish a La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 404 &quot;overt act&quot; by the victim to permit admission of the reputation evidence. As the sentence had been mandatory, the trial court's failure to delay sentencing 24 hours per La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 873 was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence were affirmed. The trial court was directed to give defendant written notice of the prescriptive period for applying for post-conviction relief within 10 days of rendition of this opinion and to file written proof in the district court record of the proceedings that defendant has received the notice.</SPAN></P>

He admitted being at the scene of the homicide; though he accused his companion of the crime, his shoeprints were matched to marks on the victim's face and neck, and the victim's blood was on his jeans. The appellate court held that the evidence, including the companion's testimony that defendant was the killer, was sufficient to prove that defendant was the perpetrator, and that he had the intent to kill or cause great bodily harm. The motion to suppers was properly denied. There was probable cause to arrest defendant for public intoxication; his request not to be questioned, was honored, and his statements were not coerced. The fact that no one testified to taking defendant's jeans from him did not preclude admissibility, as defendant did not deny the jeans were his, and a defect in the chain of custody went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. As a life sentence was mandatory, the trial court was not obliged to consider the factors set forth in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. A life sentence for a brutal murder of a helpless man did not shock the sense of justice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A deputy testified he saw defendant throw a baggie as police chased him. A forensic chemist testified that the baggie contained 22 grams of crack cocaine. An officer testified that one who bought crack for personal use would buy no more than one gram. The appellate court held that the evidence was sufficient to convict. Testimony that defendant threw the baggie up to 42 feet was not inherently improbable. Defendant's intent to distribute was proved by the large amount of drugs he possessed, and his statement to police that he could get &quot;other dealers&quot; if he was not charged. The trial court properly excluded an experiment by defendant's expert, as there was no foundation laid to show the experiment replicated the conditions of the baggie toss at the time of defendant's arrest. The jurors' handling and tossing the baggie did not amount to scientific experimentation so beyond their normal understanding as to establish that they were prejudiced by considering evidence adduced outside of the trial.

One of the agents approached defendant and asked for a &quot;20.&quot; Defendant went to a car, returned with a package, and the agent paid him $ 20. The transaction took place within 1,000 feet of a school playground. The two rock-like substances contained in the package tested positive for cocaine. Considering the gravity of the offense and the defendant's extensive prior criminal history, the sentence of 22 years of imprisonment was neither excessive nor an abuse of the trial court's discretion. The sentence was actually illegally lenient. The prosecution, however, neither objected to the sentence at trial nor appealed on the issue, and the appellate court would not correct the illegally lenient sentence imposed. Defendant had stated that he was ready for sentencing. This response constituted a waiver in delay of sentencing. No error resulted from the trial court's immediate imposition of the sentence. The trial court did err, however, in not informing the defendant of the final prescriptive period for filing post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parent, in her own right and on behalf of her minor child, sued the school board for damages arising out of a vehicular accident. Parent requested that service be withheld and the school board, upon its non-receipt of service, filed an exception of insufficiency of service, which the trial court denied. Upon rehearing, the school board was again denied relief. Upon the writ request, the court of appeals agreed that service upon the school board was required within the 90 days stated in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5107(D), and parent failed to effectuate the same. Further, the court rejected the parent's argument that service was not necessary, because the school board had knowledge of the suit. Actual knowledge of a legal action could not obviate the need for proper citation to issue. Further, the court pretermitted the issue of whether parent was entitled to demonstrate good cause for the failure to timely request service.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, No. 413-410, Louisiana, convicted both defendants, one male, one female, of possession of cocaine and denied requests to reconsider their sentences. Both defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants contended on appeal that they received ineffective assistance of counsel, while only the male defendant contended that his sentence was excessive. The appeals court disagreed as to both contentions. Sentencing the male defendant to pay fines, although he was indigent, was not improper, as he would not have been subject to incarceration for failure to pay. On the ineffectiveness claim, the court reasoned that a motion to suppress would have been futile. The arresting office turned his car and the defendants saw him. Although he shined his lights on them, there was no indication there was a stop. The officer was alone, there were no weapons, and the defendants were not surrounded. The male defendant dropped the crack pipe and therefore abandoned it. At that point, the officer stopped the defendants and, seeing the other defendant concealing something in her purse, took it from her for his protection. Once the officer found the crack pipe, he had probable cause for arrest at that point. He found the second pipe in a search of the purse incident to the other defendant's arrest. Thus there was no authority to support suppression of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, of possession of cocaine and simple battery on a police officer and was sentenced to life in prison as a fourth time offender under the Habitual Offender Law. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two police officers, who had arrested defendant a month earlier on other drug charges, saw defendant engaging in what the officers believed was a narcotics transaction in which defendant had a white spherical object about the size of a tennis ball. Defendant attempted to flee to his nearby house. The officers pursued defendant into a bathroom where they caught defendant trying to flush crack cocaine down the toilet. Defendant struggled with the officers and one of the officers received a broken hand, although the officer could not say when the injury occurred. The appellate court held that defendant's actions, coupled with the officer's knowledge of defendant and the area, gave the officer's probable cause to arrest and the officers could properly pursue defendant into the house. The trial court had therefore properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. While a trial court could depart from a mandatory minimum sentence imposed under the Habitual Offender Law if the sentence would have been excessive, such a departure would not have been appropriate in defendant's case given defendant's record and the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of New Orleans appealed a judgment from the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, in favor of the plaintiff and against the city for damages for malicious prosecution, as well as intentional infliction of emotional distress, based on the claim that plaintiff was improperly convicted of murder and was improperly incarcerated for 30 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff contended at trial that 1) the criminal trial transcript was inadmissible because no predicate was laid; and 2) the City was liable for malicious prosecution because police investigators did not give him information about a witness who could have given him a self-defense claim. The court of appeal held that 1) the criminal trial transcript was relevant to determine if there was malicious prosecution and if any failure to disclose evidence was the City or State's fault; 2) the transcript was not being used to show the truth of the matter but to explain the surrounding circumstances to determine if there was sufficient evidence concerning the self-defense claim, whether the missing witness's testimony was cumulative, whether there was a finding of error in the witness's testimony's omission, and if any error should have been imputed to the City; and 3) there was no showing that the police's failure to get the witness's data or a &quot;court clerk's&quot; sending the witness home from the trial was done intentionally to suppress evidence or ruin plaintiff's defense. The trial court's determination that the City was liable for malicious prosecution was clearly wrong.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city filed two suits to expropriate three tracts of land belonging to defendant property owners. The First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, approved the expropriation, finding a valid public purpose and legitimate public interest. A jury unanimously fixed the market value of the property and awarded moving and other expenses to the property owners, plus attorney fees. The property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">City leaders had advocated the need for a new, larger convention center. The city hired a large accounting and management firm to conduct a convention center study. The report recommended building a new, state-of-the-art convention center. The report also suggested that the city foster the development of a convention headquarters hotel. On appeal, the property owners urged that the trial court erred in allowing the city to expropriate their property for the building of the hotel. Given the constitutional authority and the home rule charter, the appellate court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:102 specifically conferred that power. Special legislative authority was not needed for the city to expropriate land. Moreover, the record did not support the property owner's contention that the city would donate expropriated land to any hotel developer. The city argued it should not have to pay the losing party's legal fees. The appellate court could not say the trial court abused its great discretion in denying certain items, such as preparation for a mock trial, as costs. Expert witness fees were also not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Civil District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, granted summary judgment for appellee current trustee in dispute to determine whether the trustee was obligated to make payments in lieu of taxes previously owed by a hotel prior to its default under certain agreements. Appellant assessor, appellant city, and appellant Industrial Development Board of the City of New Orleans, Louisiana, challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board and the hotel ratified a lease agreement, under which the hotel was to erect and operate the hotel until January 1, 2003. Because the board was organized pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:1151 et seq., the property it acquired was exempt from ad valorem taxes. The parties specified that although no property taxes were due on the property, the hotel would make annual payments to the city in an amount determined by the assessor. The hotel, subsequently, went into bankruptcy. The issue was whether the current trustee for the bondholders who financed the transaction was obligated to make payments in lieu of taxes previously owed by the hotel prior to its default. The trial court did not err in granting the trustee's motion for summary judgment; nullifying the prior assessments, liens, and adjudications; and prohibiting future tax assessments and/or tax enforcement against the property at issue. Any factual issues were resolved by reference to the 1983 contracts. No factual issue existed concerning the hotel's bankruptcy action. As long as the property at issue was owned by the board, which was established as a public body, it was exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council enacted two zoning ordinances and the citizens filed a petition challenging their enactment 25 days later. The trial court dismissed the petition as untimely. The citizens appealed, arguing the 15-day period to file suit under New Orleans, La., Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance &sect; 16.9.9.5, did not begin to run until the two ordinances were signed as approved by the mayor, returned by the mayor to the clerk of council, and entered into the record of the clerk of council. Alternatively, the citizens asserted the ordinances were unconstitutional and that prescription did not run as to a challenge to an unconstitutional ordinance. The appellate court initially noted the plain text of New Orleans, La., Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance &sect; 16.9.9.5, required that a lawsuit be filed within 15 days of the final action of the city council. The appellate court held the citizens' action was prescribed or preempted because it was untimely filed. The appellate court concluded the citizens' remaining argument was not preserved for review because it was not raised in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of New Orleans challenged the district court's ruling, declaring La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44:3(F) constitutional and allowing victim's family members to access records relevant to the investigation of the death of the victim, due to the passage of ten years after the crime. The City argued that the order jeopardized their ability to prosecute the death, that passage of the statute did not make it constitutional, and the statute violated the prohibition against the passage of local or special laws. The court of appeals disagreed, reasoning that allowing the family access to records was a statewide concern and affected all citizens and every bereaved family that was in this unfortunate position. Thus, it was not special legislation. Further, there was no merit to the City's argument that there was no reasonable basis for the creation of this statute since every Louisiana citizen who was the victim of crime would not be able to enjoy the fruits of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on a tip, some police corroboration of the tip, prior suspicion that the drugs were sold at the residence, and the location of the encounter in a high drug trafficking area, the appellate court found that the police had reasonable suspicion to justify an investigatory stop. Having found that the initial stop of the car was justified, the appellate court found that the seizure of the narcotics was proper pursuant to the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. Also, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence used to convict him. The drugs were on the floorboard of the front seat within arm's reach of defendant and thus, he had easy and immediate access to them. Also, the car belonged to defendant's brother. Thus, a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was in possession of the narcotics and that he knowingly possessed them. Furthermore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for new trial. Finally, defendant's life sentence was mandated under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(c)(ii), and was not excessive or unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The Twenty-Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Charles, Louisiana, sentenced him to nearly 50 years in prison without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbing a bank. He filed a motion for post verdict judgment of acquittal and a motion for a new trial. The motion for a new trial was grounded upon a Batson claim. Both post trial motions were denied. On appeal, defendant, a black male, contended the facts established a pattern of discrimination by the State in its exercise of peremptory challenges against black individuals in the selection of the petit jury. Specifically, he contended the trial court erred in finding the State presented race-neutral reasons for the exercise of its challenges. The appeals court ruled that the trial court correctly denied defendant's Batson challenge, as the State gave race-neutral reasons for each of defendant's challenges. None of the reasons for exclusion expressed by the prosecutor indicated a discriminatory intent, rather they were directed at effective trial strategy. Further, the trial court's sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive, as the record revealed that the trial judge clearly particularized the sentence to the offender and the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants were charged in a two-count bill of information in count one with distribution of marijuana. Only one was charged in count two with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. On 14 December 1998, a motion to suppress evidence was denied as to both appellants. The Criminal District Court Orleans Parish, Section G (Louisiana), convicted them and sentenced them to 25-year terms. They appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that one defendant offered to get undercover officers, whom he thought were tourists, &quot;whatever they needed,&quot; girls or drugs; that the officers gave him a marked $ 20 bill for weed; that he in turn gave it to the other defendant; and that the other defendant gave the officers marijuana. Defendants were arrested. More marijuana was found in the first defendant's shoes. They were convicted. The appellate court held that HIV status was not a legislatively recognized mitigator. Thus the first defendant's sentence was not excessive, nor his counsel ineffective. As the second defendant pled guilty to the multiple bill, he could not appeal as to whether there was sufficient evidence at the multiple offender hearing. As each defendant testified that he did not know or speak to the other on the night of the offense, and although the jury found neither credible, the record indicated no actual conflict by their joint counsel. The evidence showed sufficient intent by the second defendant. The first defendant wrongly was convicted on two counts but sentenced on only one.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions and the one-count defendant's habitual offender adjudication were affirmed. The two-count defendant's sentence was affirmed and the case remanded for sentencing on possession with intent to distribute due to the trial court's apparently inadvertent vacating of the sentence imposed on that count.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, convicted defendant of two counts of aggravated assault and two counts of armed robbery.

Also, the officers' testimony was sufficient to prove that defendant committed aggravated assaults upon the police officers when they testified that defendant pulled a gun and attempted to fire on them. Further, the trial court's sentences of five years at hard labor on each conviction of aggravated assault were not unconstitutionally excessive sentences where defendant had a prior conviction for possession of stolen property and where he committed the aggravated assaults on the police officers in his attempt to escape apprehension for two armed robberies. The trial court did not err when it denied defendant's motion in arrest of judgment because it was not timely filed and he did not assert proper grounds in support of the motion.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pointed the gun at the victim's six-month-old son to coerce him into complying with his demands, struck the victim in the head and stomach with his gun, put the gun in his mouth, asked him if he wanted to die, and then demanded money and the victim's laptop computer.

Therefore, the trial court was in error in applying a minimum 20-year without benefit sentence for defendant's crime, which occurred before the 20-year minimum sentence was added to the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his convictions and sentences, contending that the trial court: (1) assessed an excessive sentence and (2) erred in denying his motion to suppress, and also (3) that the evidence was insufficient to warrant conviction. The appeals court disagreed. The trial court was within its discretion in assessing harsh consecutive sentences, despite failing to fully articulate the factors it considered. Due to severity of the crime and defendant's criminal and arrest record, the assignment of error was without merit. The denial of a suppression order was also not error, as defendant failed to make a threshold showing that the identification procedure was suggestive. Further, the victim not only knew the defendant by face but by name. Defendant's act of shooting the victim at close range so that he could steal his car, and again shooting the victim after he had stolen the car, was evidence that substantiated the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been convicted of aggravated battery in the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana. The trial court imposed the maximum allowable prison term of 10 years. Defendant's conviction was affirmed on appeal but the case was remanded for sentencing due to a technical error. The trial court again imposed a 10 year sentence and defendant appealed the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the imposition of the maximum allowable prison term for the offense of which he was convicted was excessive. Defendant had orally objected to the sentence as excessive at the time of sentencing but had not filed a written motion for reconsideration of sentence nor stated the exact grounds supporting the claim that the sentence was excessive. The appellate court therefore limited its review to whether the sentence was constitutionally excessive. Defendant had entered the home of his ex-girlfriend to check on the couple's child and got into a fight with the girlfriend's live-in companion, who thought defendant was going to attack him in bed. The victim got a knife but defendant took the knife and stabbed the victim several times as the victim tried to flee. The victim was so badly injured that he missed several months of work. The appellate court held that the sentence was not constitutionally excessive, and given the facts of the case the trial court had not abused its discretion in imposing the maximum allowable prison term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Unlike six other companies, three defendants, buyer, tank manufacturer, and transporter, did not settle with plaintiffs, residents, in their class actions over a railroad tank car chemical leak and fire. The Civil District Court, Orleans Parish, Division &quot;Ad Hoc-B&quot; (Louisiana), by jury, found the three liable for 5, 5, and 15 percent, respectively, of the compensatory damages, and transporter liable for $ 850 million punitives. They appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Buyer bought a flammable volatile carcinogenic heavier-than-air and easy-to-smell gas, arranged for its transport, but sent no one to inspect the loading. Transporter was notified that the pressurized railroad tank car was parked on its interchange tracks, which were in a residential area. Over six hours passed without inspection. The gas leaked; spread and reached an ignition source, possibly a home's hot water heater; ignited; and flashed back to ignite the car. The neighborhood was evacuated. The fire burned for two days, depositing soot in the area. Five other such cars coupled to the burning one were successfully moved away. Fortunately the car neither exploded nor launched itself. Residents sued. The appellate court held that the jury could have found that by not making inspection, transporter acted in wanton disregard of public safety under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315.3. The leak was foreseeable. The fact that the quantum of punitives were determined when the quantum of compensatory damages had been determined as to only 20 of 8,047 plaintiff class members did not violate due process. Manufacturer had duty to warn about gasket.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed and the case remanded for proceedings as to the quantum of compensatory damages with respect to the remaining class members.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A parole officer knocked on a door, which was answered by defendant, and identified himself. He asked defendant to open the door, and defendant did so, whereupon the officer detected a strong smell of marijuana. The appellate court found nothing in the record to support the contention that the warrantless search of defendant's home was a subterfuge for a police investigation. The officer had reasonable suspicion that defendant was in parole violation when he and the other agents went to defendant's home. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction: defendant exercised dominion and control over the marijuana. As to defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant was essentially complaining about the attorney's trial strategy. Defendant failed to meet his burden in showing counsel was ineffective. As to the sentence, the trial court did not err in sentencing defendant as a second offender.</SPAN></P>

The officer stopped defendant and conducted a pat down search. The officer found a wrapper containing crack cocaine on the ground next to defendant's leg and cocaine on defendant's pants leg. Defendant alleged the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to stop defendant for an investigation. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence as the preponderance of the evidence did not clearly favor suspicion. However, the failure of the trial court to advise defendant of his right to a hearing and to remain silent as to the multiple bill violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(D)(1)(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sustained the DHH's exception pleading lack of subject matter jurisdiction as to injunctive relief. The ministry filed an appeal, assigning as error the trial court's judgment partially granting the DHH's declinatory exception pleading the objection of lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The DHH relied on La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3601 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4062. The ministry argued the case did not involve the expenditure of public funds. If the case involved expenditure of public funds and the expenditure would result in a deficit, no injunctive relief was possible. The trial court rejected the ministry's argument, stating it was clear the case involved the expenditure of public funds. The appellate court found no error in the trial court's ruling.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sixteenth Judicial District Court, in and for the Parish of St. Mary, State of Louisiana, convicted defendant of one count of attempted first-degree murder. The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction. However, the supreme court reversed the appellate court's decision and remanded the case so the appellate court could address defendant's remaining assignments of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The criminal case allotment system in the trial court violated due process. However, defendant did not argue that prejudice occurred as a result of the allotment of his case and there was no record of any actual prejudice to defendant. Thus, the assignment of defendant's trial under the unconstitutional allotment system was at most harmless error. Also, defendant argued that the prosecutor improperly commented on his right to remain silent in his closing argument. Because defendant failed to object at the time that the statement was made, he was precluded from raising the issue on appeal. Further, although the definition of the crime the trial court read to the jury during voir dire was incorrect, the error did not warrant a mistrial because the correct definition was given during the trial court's final instruction to the jury. In addition, defendant the evidence was sufficient to support the element of a drive-by shooting that required the shooting to take place from a public highway or street. Finally, the appellate court found that defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence that resulted from an unconstitutional search and seizure. A search by a club security guard, a private citizen, was not prohibited by the Fourth Amendment because it only protected against illegal searches by government agents. By entering the club, defendant had no expectation of privacy and consented to the search. Defendant maintained that the seizure of the plastic bag containing cocaine by the detective was prohibited because the officer did not know what was contained in the defendant's pocket when he initiated the search. The Fourth Amendment did not prohibit governmental use of the then non-private information. The officer conducted a limited search, which was the least intrusive means reasonably available to insure the officer's own safety. When the plastic bag containing the white rocks became apparent to the officer, he possessed probable cause at that point to search and seize the bag without a warrant. The officer had probable cause to believe that the defendant possessed contraband or a weapon, and was justified in the warrantless detention/arrest and search.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner alleged that the trial judge erred in ruling that the Commissioner did not have standing to seek judicial review of the decision rendered by the Division of Administrative Law and in dismissing the suit with prejudice without allowing the Commissioner an opportunity to amend the petition. The Louisiana Administrative Procedure Act (LAPA), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:964(A)(2), allowed the Commissioner to argue its position before the administrative law judge but specifically excluded judicial review to an agency or an official. The court found that the legislature manifested a clear intention to limit the Department of Insurance's right to seek judicial review. The Louisiana Constitution did not give a juridical person, the Commissioner, the same constitutionally protected rights reserved to the individual and for the good of the whole. There was no error by the trial court in failing to allow the Commissioner to amend the petition because the insurance company's exception of no right of action was constitutional. The Commissioner had an adequate remedy at law by filing a declaratory judgment action or other type proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals affirmed, holding that the State failed to plead even bare bone facts to support its allegations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen could not produce his driver's license, because he left it at home when he went to pick up his wife from work. A municipal court judge had recommended that anyone unable to produce a driver's license should be arrested, and that recommendation had been passed on to the city's police officers without any determination of its legality. This procedure created a de facto policy. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:411.1 and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 211.4, when the officer had reasonable grounds to believe the citizen was driving without a license, he was to, and did, determine if a license had been issued to the citizen and whether that license was under suspension, revocation, or cancellation. When he determined a valid license had been issued to the citizen, he was to issue a citation rather than arrest the citizen. While the officer could not be held accountable for following a departmental &quot;directive,&quot; the city was obligated to determine the legality of the judge's recommendation and could be held liable for its failure to do so.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hit another vehicle, causing it to flip over, while trying to pass a truck. The other vehicle's driver died. Defendant testified at his wife's trial that she had been driving the car, but later admitted he had been driving. Under La. Rev. Stat. 14:32.1, defendant should have been assessed a fine, as well as imprisonment, but the appellate court did not correct this error since the State did not raise it. Defendant was not entitled to the suppression of results of blood tests conducted with his consent. Defendant's motion to continue, after one of his attorneys discovered the victim was a close friend's fiancee, was properly denied because orally made after jury selection had begun. Considering defendant's criminal history, and his lack of remorse, outlined in the trial court's extensive findings under La. Code Crim. Proc. 894.1, defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive. Defendant did not preserve his argument to suppress his blood tests because they were conducted by persons without the requisite qualifications since he did not object to their admission at trial, and his argument at a hearing to suppress them was different than that raised on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced to 20 years at hard labor and a concurrent term of 6 months in jail upon convictions for DUI and vehicular homicide. A motion to reconsider the sentences was denied. On appeal, he contended that the sentence was unconstitutionally excessive and did not give sufficient weight to the mitigating factors he presented. The appeals court disagreed and affirmed.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:32.1 allowed for imprisonment with or without hard labor for not less than nor more than 20 years. The trial judge considered the facts of the accident, the pre-sentencing investigation report, as well as evidence of mitigation, including that he had a family, a career, remorse for the victim, and a realization of what he had done. However, appellant had numerous past offenses for DUI, a callous disregard for the safety of others, a blood alcohol content of three times the legal limit, and an incapability or refusal to achieve alcohol rehabilitation. Thus the sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of armed robbery committed with a gun, pursuant La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64. The State filed written notice of its intention to apply the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;14:64.3. At the conclusion of trial, a jury in the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, returned a verdict of guilty as charged as to both counts. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two victims had dinner and then checked into a motel. Two men appeared in the open doorway of the motel room. One of them, later identified as defendant, pointed a gun. The victims were ordered into the bathroom. When they came out, they saw that the victim's car was gone. In his first allegation of error, the defendant alleged that the imposition of a greater sentence under the auspices of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64.3 was unconstitutional. The appellate court's relevant inquiry was whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64.3 required a factual determination, and if so, whether that determination increased the sentence beyond the maximum statutory penalty. The statute clearly required a factual determination as to whether the armed robbery was committed using a firearm as opposed to some other dangerous instrumentality. The only weapon mentioned by prosecution witnesses was a gun. The trial court's imposition of two five-year sentences did not increase the penalty beyond the maximum term. The sentence, therefore, did not violate due process. Under the circumstances, the appellate court also did not find that the 30-year sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed and the matter was remanded to provide notice to defendant of limitations for filing post convictions relief.</SPAN></P>

Brother finally filed a proposed judgment of succession, after notice to heir, and the estate was distributed according to the plan. Heir questioned the accuracy of the distribution. A meeting was held and letters were exchanged, but no further action was taken, other than a request by heir for the distribution of proceeds of the sale of property the brothers received as part of the estate, until almost one year later, when heir file his petition to reopen. Heir had cashed all distribution checks sent to him. The appellate court held that a succession could be reopened only where other property was found or there was other good cause. The case did not involve new found property and, as heir had not filed his petition until after all the property had been distributed, the appellate court could not say that the trial court had abused its discretion in denying the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed placing a gun in the trunk of an automobile he had not been occupying. An officer retrieved the gun and found a bag of crack cocaine. When defendant was arrested, he had a key to the trunk in his pocket. Only the first five years of a sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute could be imposed without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension. That period was two and one-half years, when the conviction was for attempt. Finding a key to the car's trunk in defendant's pocket, after he was observed placing a gun there, was sufficient to establish his dominion and control over the contraband also found in the trunk. The trial court's mischaracterization of the felony defendant was previously convicted of, in finding him to be a prior offender, was not a basis for vacating his multiple offender adjudication. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not ordering a presentence investigation. The trial court enumerated the factors it considered in imposing sentence, pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, as well as the current conviction, and did not abuse discretion in imposing sentence.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court upheld the sentence. The court reasoned that the instant offense was committed only 18 months after defendant was released from prison for convictions of robbery and forcible rape, for which he served 10 years. This prior imprisonment term did not serve either to rehabilitate him or to deter him from committing sexual acts against women. The sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), entered a final judgment setting plaintiff's damages and apportioning fault at one-third to defendant city and two-thirds to defendant unknown driver, where plaintiff was injured when the unknown driver veered a stolen vehicle off a road and struck plaintiff. Plaintiff appealed the allocation of fault. Defendant city appealed an evidentiary finding and the sufficiency of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party was walking near an intersection designed, constructed, and maintained by defendant city. Suddenly, a stolen vehicle being driven by a person left the roadway, jumped the curb, and struck plaintiff. The driver of the vehicle fled. Plaintiff suffered debilitating injuries. Plaintiff sued defendant unknown driver, and also sued defendant city on a theory of negligent design, construction, and maintenance of a dangerous and unfit zigzag intersection. Plaintiff introduced testimony from an expert witness who based his testimony on the dangerousness of the road on police reports. The trial court found defendant city one-third liable and defendant unknown driver two-thirds liable for plaintiff's injuries. After judgment was entered accordingly, the appellate court modified the judgment because La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2324 allowed plaintiff to recover 50 percent of his damages from one tortfeasor even though that tortfeasor was found only one-third liable. Also, the evidence was sufficient to find defendant city negligent. The expert's testimony was properly admitted and plaintiff's award of interest could not be capped.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed as modified. No error occurred in assigning fault. Also, plaintiff's expert was properly allowed to testify as to opinions based on police reports otherwise inadmissible as hearsay. However, under applicable statutory law, plaintiff was entitled to recover from defendant city 50 percent of his damages even though it was found only one-third at fault. Finally, plaintiff was entitled to full judicial interest.</SPAN></P>

In viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have found that the defendant touched the genitalia of the victim with his mouth or tongue against her will by force despite her utmost resistance, and the facts presented at trial supported the district attorney's decision to prosecute him under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:43.4. The trial court considered a wide range of factors in sentencing the defendant, and a sentence of four-and-one-half years could hardly be considered excessive given the aggravating nature of his crime and the possible range of sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment, based upon a jury verdict, of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, convicting him of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. He pled guilty to attempted possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The trial court adjudicated appellant a third felony offender as to the cocaine charge, and sentenced him to life imprisonment, with a concurrent four year sentence on the firearms charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers, armed with a search warrant for appellant's residence, set up a surveillance to verify appellant was still selling narcotics. The officers observed 11 drug transactions and ultimately seized numerous bags of cocaine, two beepers, a significant amount of cash, and a revolver. On appeal, the appellant argued the search warrant application failed to establish probable cause to believe that contraband would be found. He also contended the search warrant was &quot;stale.&quot; The convictions were affirmed. The search warrant affidavit established the confidential informant's knowledge, reliability, and veracity. Further, information provided by the informant regarding ongoing cocaine sales at appellant's residence gave the trial judge probable cause to believe that five days after the first controlled purchase, cocaine would still be found. The erroneous denial of a motion to recuse one trial judge, who was a former district attorney, was harmless error, as appellant did not suffer any prejudice. Finally, appellant failed to rebut the presumption that the mandatory life sentence imposed on him as a third-felony habitual offender was unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. There was no indication appellant would have faired better had one trial judge, who had been employed with the district attorney's office at the time the office was prosecuting appellant, been recused as to the firearm charge and a new judge appointed to accept appellant's guilty plea. Mandatory life sentence for appellant, a third offender convicted of three drug offenses, was not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sued appellees in the 15th Judicial District Court, Lafayette Parish (Louisiana), for medical malpractice, alleging one of their children contracted the hepatitis C virus as a result of a blood transfusion administered by appellee hospital with blood supplied by appellee blood bank. The trial court granted appellees' exceptions of prescription and appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sued 15 years after the transfusion. Appellees asserted the three year medical malpractice prescriptive period in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628 prescribed the action. Appellees were not &quot;qualified health care providers&quot; under the Medical Malpractice Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.41 et seq., but &sect; 9:5628 applied to non-qualified health care providers, like appellee hospital, as the statute did not preclude such application, and the definition of &quot;health care provider&quot; included hospitals.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.41(D) also required this conclusion. &quot;Health care provider&quot; did not include &quot;community blood center,&quot; so &sect; 9:5628 did not prescribe appellants' action against appellee blood bank, and their action was filed within the general tort prescriptive period. The fact that the latency period of appellants' child's disease exceeded the prescriptive period in &sect; 9.5628 did not render application of the statute unconstitutional as it did not create a classification discriminating against a class of individuals because of their physical condition, and the record did not indicate the statute furthered no state interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was partly affirmed, as appellants' claim against appellee hospital was prescribed, and partly reversed, as appellant's claim against appellee blood bank was not prescribed because, at the time of the transfusion, blood banks were not health care providers under the medical malpractice act, and the action was filed within the general tort prescriptive period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, in separate lawsuits consolidated because they addressed similar legal issues, each sued appellees in the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), to recover penalties and interest assessed on delinquent property taxes. The trial court maintained exceptions of prescription, and appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city adopted an ordinance imposing penalties and interest on those who were delinquent in paying their property taxes. Those penalties and interest were imposed on appellants, who acknowledged they were delinquent in the payment of their property taxes. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2110 (Supp. 2001), appellants could only challenge the validity of the tax if they first timely paid it. This included a challenge to appellee city's ordinance imposing penalties and interest for delinquent taxes. Appellants' acknowledgments, in each of their petitions, that they were delinquent in the payment of their taxes, placed upon them the burden of negating appellees' allegation that their claims had each prescribed, since prescription was apparent on the face of their petitions. The payment-under-protest requirement of &sect; 47:2110 applied not only to the base ad valorem tax but also to the enforcement of any provision of the tax laws, including a challenge to interest and penalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed because appellants were not statutorily eligible to challenge appellee city's ordinance imposing penalties and interest for delinquent taxes unless they timely paid their taxes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A victim identified defendant as one of three men who robbed him at gunpoint. Defendant was tried and convicted of aggravated burglary, found by the trial court to be a third felony offender, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant appealed; the appellate court affirmed. The sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive, as it was imposed under the Habitual Offender Statute, which had previously been held to be constitutional. Defendant claimed that the State made a deal with the victim, who had criminal charges pending, in exchange for his testimony. He claimed error in the State's failure to disclose this deal, in the perjury the victim committed when he denied that any deal was made, and in the trial court's bias against defendant because of the deal. But the victim, on direct examination, denied that any deal had been made; the fact that after the trial the victim pled guilty to theft and received a suspended sentence was not proof of any deal, and the trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant to cross-examine witnesses about the victim's alleged drug dealing, because such evidence was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appeals the judgment of the 24th Judicial District Court, Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, denying his motion to suppress a gun seized and that his guilty plea was invalid, as the court imposed an incarceration condition, which he had not been informed of, prior to his plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to the charge of with being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. On a Crosby appeal, he alleged that the trial court erred in failing to suppress the gun seized from his person and that his guilty plea was invalid because the judge imposed a condition on his incarceration, that he would not be eligible for parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, which he had not been informed of previously. The appeals court affirmed his conviction, first reasoning that officers had probable cause to suspect defendant had been involved in a crime, pursuant to a disturbance call. When defendant fled, this added to the officer's suspicions that rose to probable cause to arrest. The resulting search and seizure was thus incident to a valid arrest. On the second claim of error, the court reasoned that the record established defendant was informed of the condition. Further, under a Crosby appeal, defendant could not claim a sentence qualification as error, since it was not a non-jurisdictional defect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, through his guardian, sued various defendants. After trial of the admiralty claim, the 25th Judicial District Court, Louisiana, found for plaintiff and awarded him damages. Plaintiff moved to tax costs, including witness fees and expenses. Plaintiff and the sheriff of a parish moved to tax as costs the sheriff's commission. Defendants appealed the judgments awarding the sheriff his commission and plaintiff his costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In opposition to the sheriff's motion to tax cost, defendants argued in their memorandum that the fee and commission were an unconstitutional tax on interstate commerce in violation of the United States Constitution. The appellate court found no error in the trial court's judgment. Defendants complained that the cost of the fee awarded for the testimony of a witness fee was excessive. After reviewing the record, the appellate court did not find that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding this expert's fee, totaling $ 3,000, for his preparation and testimony at trial. The appellate court, however, reversed the judgment awarding the travel expenses of a foreign witness. However, the appellate court affirmed the award of this witness's fee. Defendants complained that the trial court erred in awarding costs for reports prepared by an expert before plaintiff filed suit. Because the record convinced the court that the expert prepared these reports as part of plaintiff's medical examination and treatment, the appellate court believed the trial court abused its discretion awarding the cost of these reports to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, in part, reducing the award of costs. The judgment was also affirmed, in part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), of attempted possession of a firearm while in possession of a controlled and dangerous substance. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was among a group of people stopped by police as possible truants. One of the group attempted to dispose of cocaine by swallowing it. Police then patted defendant down, discovered a pistol, and arrested defendant for carrying a concealed weapon. Upon a search incident to arrest, police discovered crack cocaine in one of defendant's pockets. The stop and search of defendant were both permissible, in light of the involvement of illegal narcotics, even though they were initially found on defendant's companion. At trial, the prosecutor stated defendant had earned his living by selling crack cocaine, although there was no evidence of that. The trial court sustained defendant's objection, but defense counsel failed to request a mistrial. The comment was clearly improper under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 774, and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 770(2) required the trial court to grant a mistrial, upon motion. Defense counsel's failure to request a mistrial and/or an admonition of the jury prejudiced defendant to the extent of depriving him of a fair trial. Therefore, defendant did not receive the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. VI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was vacated because he did not receive effective assistance of counsel when his counsel failed to move for a mistrial after the prosecutor's unsupported comment that defendant had earned his living by selling drugs, particularly where defendant's defense depended upon the jury's evaluation of defendant's credibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment, based upon a jury verdict, of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, convicting him of manslaughter and sentencing him to serve 40 years in prison at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of killing the mother of his estranged wife. The victim was six and one-half months pregnant when she died. The fetus died with the victim. On appeal, defendant argued the evidence was insufficient to support his manslaughter conviction. He did not dispute that his gun fired the fatal bullet. He insisted, however, that the weapon discharged accidentally. The judgment was affirmed. The evidence indicated that shortly before the shooting, defendant and his estranged wife argued over custody of their child and interfering family members at the victim's residence. Defendant returned to his apartment, armed himself with a gun, and returned to the victim's apartment. Several witnesses testified defendant forcibly entered the residence by breaking the door, and then proceeded to the victim's bedroom. The State's witnesses testified defendant stood in the bedroom, and fired the fatal shot with no words spoken. The jury's verdict was rational. Further, the statutory maximum sentence of 40 years was not unconstitutionally excessive due to the sense of shock and outrage at the loss suffered by the victim's family.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Even though defendant testified the shooting was accidental, the jury rationally chose to disregard defendant's account, and instead, credited the testimony of the State's witnesses that the shooting was intentional. Though maximum manslaughter sentence was imposed, the trial court properly considered the sentencing guidelines and its sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained an objection to the portion of the conversation identifying defendant, but allowed the rest of it. The appellate court agreed with defendant that even though the evidence of identity had technically been excluded, it was not possible to &quot;unring the bell.&quot; Any error was however harmless beyond a reasonable doubt given that victim knew defendant well and positively identified him as the shooter. The serious nature of victim's wounds and defendant's juvenile record of drug and weapon offenses, which was included in the record as required, justified defendant's sentence as not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendants for medical malpractice in the 19th Judicial District Court, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. They settled with one defendant for the maximum allowed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42B(1), and summary judgment in favor of the remaining defendants was granted. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' advised defendants of certain symptoms their child was experiencing. The child was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, resulting in profound neurological impairment. Plaintiffs alleged defendants' medical care of the child had been substandard. They settled with one defendant and the Louisiana Patients' Compensation Fund (Fund) for the maximum amounts allowed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42B(1) and pursued their action against the remaining defendants. Those defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds that, when plaintiffs settled with one defendant and the Fund, they received the maximum amount to which they were legally entitled. When damage could not be apportioned between multiple tortfeasors because the damage was indivisible, the claim was not severable. If the damage could be divided into two or more parts, with each part caused by a separate defendant, then each part constituted a separate injury under &sect; 40:1299.42B(1). Otherwise the injured party could only recover the maximum provided by &sect; 40:1299.42B(1). There was no evidence the child's injury could be divided into parts with each part traceable back to a specific delictual origin.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed because plaintiffs had recovered the maximum amount to which they were statutorily entitled when they settled with one of the defendants. Therefore, they could not pursue their claim against the remaining defendants. Plaintiffs' constitutional challenge to the applicable statute was not considered, since they received the maximum statutory recovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the District Court, Parish of Jefferson, State of Louisiana, of possession of cocaine. After a multiple bill hearing, the trial court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers, checking on a complaint of drug sales, knocked on a motel room door. A man who fit the description given by the anonymous complainant answered the door; drug paraphernalia was in plain view. Officers found defendant hiding in a shower, and handcuffed him after he tried to flee. He made movements towards his ankle; an officer frisked him and felt a package, which proved to contain drugs, in his sock. Defendant was tried and convicted of possession of cocaine, and sentenced as a multiple offender. He appealed; the appellate court affirmed. The officers needed no reasonable suspicion to knock on the door, and the drug gear in plain view gave them probable cause to arrest. Further, the warrantless entry was justified by exigent circumstances. Defendant's actions supplied reasonable suspicion to detain and frisk him. So the motion to suppress was properly denied. When defendant pled guilty to the predicate offense, he was advised of and waived his Boykin rights, and advised of potential sentences, and thus was properly sentenced as a second felony offender. His sentence was not excessive, as he had prior criminal activities and committed the crime while on probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The trial court properly denied the motion to suppress, as the warrantless entry of the motel room, and the pat-down search of defendant, were legal. Defendant was properly sentenced, as the record proved that his guilty plea to the predicate offence was proper under Boykin, and the sentence was not excessive in light of his criminal record and the fact that he committed the instant crime while on probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, uncle and aunt of the child, brought action against defendant father in the 22nd Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of St. Tammany, Louisiana, seeking custody of their sister's minor child. Intervenor-plaintiffs were the child's maternal grandparents. When the trial court awarded visitation rights to the intervenor-parents, all parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the father of the minor child. The child's mother died from the effects of an inoperable brain tumor. Immediately following the mother's death, plaintiffs, her brother and his wife instituted the instant action seeking issuance of an emergency ex parte order granting them full custody of the child pending further orders from the court. The intervenor-plaintiffs were the maternal grandparents. At first blush, La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 136 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:344 appeared to conflict. However, the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:344 superceded those provisions of the article. Accordingly, the trial court awarded visitation rights to the maternal grandparents. Having found La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 136 to be inapplicable to these facts, there was no need for the trial court to undertake an analysis of the five factors listed in the article to determine if such visitation was in the best interest of the child. Since the intervenor-plaintiffs were granted visitation pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:344A, it was hoped that they would serve as the natural conduits through which plaintiffs could sustain their relationship with the child.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(A)(1); and sentenced him to life imprisonment at hard labor, without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>

Two hours later the officer and his partner returned. The car was in the same place. Defendant was handing another male something, was startled on seeing the officers, balled up his fist and began walking to the store, was stopped and frisked by the officers, and dropped a foil packet on the ground. The other male had walked the other way. The officers found heroin in the packet, arrested defendant, entered the car, and found heroin and a gun there. The officers took defendant away. The car was gone when they returned. Defendant was convicted. The appellate court held that the motion to suppress was properly denied. Under the totality of the circumstances, the officers reasonably suspected that defendant was committing a crime, and had probable cause to believe more contraband was in the car. Admission of the gun was not prejudicial. Defendant had full access to the car. Exclusion of newspaper allegations against the officer was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents of expelled high school students challenged the order of the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier, Louisiana, which affirmed rescinding a TRO and denied their injunctive relief against the expulsions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant students were expelled for leaving school without authorization and for use/possession of controlled substances. Their parents sought review and injunctive relief from the district court, contending the expulsion was not supported by substantial and rational evidence. The district court issued a temporary restraining order, TRO, directing the board to re-admit, but later rescinded and dismissed the TRO and denied appellants' requests for injunctive relief. The appeals court found technical error in charging the students with possession of a controlled substance, but did not find any procedural violations. The board properly found a violation subject to suspension and expulsion. However, the expulsions were vacated because of the confusion in the record created by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:416(C)(2)(a)(ii). The court recognized expulsion with assignment to an alternative school was a possible punishment, but the officials' discretion in administering punishment was arbitrary and abusive and did not account for any prior disciplinary problems, or lack of the same, and the actual disruption to the educational environment resulting from the student's drug use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order vacated and case remanded. School board did afford appellants clear notice of their acts of misconduct and the opportunity to be heard, but official discretion was arbitrary and abusive for not accounting for any prior disciplinary problem (or lack of same) and the actual disruption to the educational environment.</SPAN></P>

Appellant brought suit and alleged it did not seek injunctive relief, as La. Rev. Stat.

The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees. The appellate court found good cause did not exist for appellant to not have sought injunctive relief and that, therefore, appellant had waived any right to bring an ordinary proceeding under &sect; 38:2220B.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff doctor, through defendant realtor, bought a building on property that was zoned B-2 and had it renovated for $ 150,000. Plaintiff discovered that half the parking spaces actually belonged to the neighboring office. Defendant city issued a certificate of occupancy. Defendant city amended its medical clinic parking ordinance and made Shreveport, La., Code of Ordinances &sect; 106-1338(2), deleting any low patient count exception. Plaintiff was denied a variance for more parking and received no offers when he listed the property for sale as a medical office. Plaintiff sued defendant realtor for breach for having failed to determine parking ordinance compliance, and sued defendant city for negligently granting building permits and a certificate for a project that did not conform with the parking law. Defendants were granted dismissal. The court affirmed. The sale contract with defendant realtor put the burden on plaintiff to confirm zoning compliance. Defendant realtor had no duty to warn of a potential parking ordinance amendment. The permit for mere renovation required no parking plat, and by the time the certificate issued, plaintiff's costs had been all incurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with crime against nature in soliciting a police officer to engage in oral copulation for money. The State filed a multiple bill, accusing defendant of being a fourth offender. After a hearing, the trial court found defendant to be a second offender. Defendant alleged counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the sufficiency of prior convictions that were used to find defendant a second offender. The State alleged the evidence was sufficient in the two convictions the trial court rejected. The appellate court found the evidence presented was sufficient to support a finding defendant was advised of her Boykin rights. Therefore, counsel was not ineffective for his failure to object. The State's presentation of a minute entry for one conviction showing defendant was attended by counsel when she pled guilty, along with a properly executed waiver of rights/guilty plea form, was sufficient to carry the State's burden under the multiple offender statute. However, because the plea form for the other conviction was not dated and a handwritten addition could have been added at any time, the evidence was not sufficient for the other conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction was affirmed as trial counsel was not ineffective. The trial court's adjudication of defendant as a second felony offender and defendant's sentence as a second felony offender were vacated. The appellate court adjudicated defendant to be a third offender, and remanded the matter to the trial court for re-sentencing as a third offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found the defendant Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) 90 percent at fault in a personal injury case. The remaining 10 percent of fault was attributed to the driver of a dump truck. The 18th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Iberville, Louisiana entered judgment in accordance with the verdict. A motion to intervene was filed on behalf of the State's insurer. Defendant DOTD appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were employees of defendant construction company. Plaintiffs were in a company dump truck traveling to a job site. One of the plaintiffs was driving while the other two sat in the front seat. As the unloaded dump truck approached an Interstate Highway 12 (I-12) overpass the plaintiff driver suddenly swerved into the left lane. The truck careened into the bridge rail along the overpass and vaulted over the railing to the ground below. One of the plaintiffs was left confined to a wheelchair for the remainder of his life and required reconstructive surgery. Defendant DOTD's liability was based on the defective condition of the bridge rail along the I-12 overpass. Plaintiff driver was also required to share some responsibility for the harm suffered. The awards of general damages bore a reasonable relationship to the elements of the proved damages. The appellate court declined to modify the award for future medical costs and life care. The appellate court did find it likely that the jury made an award of sympathy to one plaintiff's mother and reduced this award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to intervene by defendant State's insurer was dismissed. The judgment of the trial court finding the driver 10 percent at fault was reversed, and the percentage of fault attributable to the driver was increased to 35 percent. The award to the mother of the plaintiffs was amended to $ 125,000. In all other respects, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of their minor child, alleged that defendant negligently allowed their medical malpractice claim to prescribe. Also in this original petition, the plaintiffs raised the issue of the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5605. The 21st Judicial District Court In and for the Parish of Tangipahoa, State of Louisiana sustained the defendants' exception of prescription. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The determination of the date of discovery in the instant case was greatly facilitated by the plaintiff mother's own admission, in a letter written to their current attorney and attached to their petition, that a short time prior to April 28, 1997, they were told by other attorneys that defendant had let the time run out on their medical malpractice claim. Thus, by her own admission, plaintiffs knew of defendant's alleged wrongful conduct at the latest by the date of the letter. Therefore, their action against him, filed more than one year from the date of discovery, was untimely, and the trial court was correct in so finding. Plaintiffs also sought a remand for consideration of the issue and a reevaluation of their prescription arguments in light of the outcome on the constitutionality issue. The appellate court found no merit to plaintiffs' argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Plaintiffs' action was untimely when action was filed more than one year of discovery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, issued a writ of mandamus to compel defendants, City of New Orleans and treasurer for the City of New Orleans and collector of revenue for the city, to remit certain tax monies to plaintiffs, Louisiana Assessors' Retirement Fund and the Louisiana Clerks' of Court Retirement and Relief Fund, under La.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 11:1481, 11:1561 to remit to them a percentage of taxes. The parties testified that no contributions had ever been made by defendant city to either retirement fund in accordance with the statutes. The writ was granted. An order issued as to 1999 and subsequent years. Defendants appealed. The court affirmed. The statutes' constitutionality was not reviewable as defendants had not raised that below. Defendants' contemporaneous construction argument, that defendant city had interpreted the statutes as not applying to it for 25 years and that therefore such interpretation deserved deference, was undermined by defendant treasurer's testimony that he had not been aware of the statutes. Apparently, defendants had never made a conscious decision to ignore the statutes. Because of defendant city's chronic financial challenges, mandamus was the proper remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank sued seeking redemption of a property or cancellation of a tax sale of property on which it was a mortgagee. Appellant alleged the sheriff and ex-officio tax collector had violated the bank's constitutional right to due process. The mortgagor had given appellant a mortgage on the property. Appellant duly recorded that interest in the parish's public records. The property was sold at a sheriff's sale after the mortgagors failed to pay taxes. Although the mortgagors received notice of the sale, appellant was not notified of it. Appellant claimed either that it was entitled to notice under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2180.1 or that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court found both the sale and the statute to be valid. Appellant challenged that holding. The court reversed. A reasonably ascertainable mortgagee, as a party with an interest in property, did not waive its constitutional due process right to notice of seizure and sale of property by failing to request notice under the statute. While the statute was constitutional, appellant was entitled to notice of the seizure and sale because it was a reasonably ascertainable mortgagee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and judgment rendered for appellant because the failure of the sheriff and ex-officio tax collector to give appellant, in its capacity as mortgagee with a significant property interest, due notice of the tax sale violated appellant's constitutional right to due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the life sentence imposed by the District Court, Parish of Washington, Louisiana, on his conviction for second degree murder, arguing that the trial court erred in not considering the aggravating and mitigating factors, and in not imposing the longest sentence that was not constitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant stabbed his victim 40 times, bludgeoned him with a hammer, and set fire to the victim's trailer to cover up the crime. He was tried for and convicted of second-degree murder. The trial judge sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Appellant sought review; the appellate court affirmed. While the trial court did not explain why it imposed a life sentence, the record showed that appellant's crime involved profoundly violent acts resulting in the victim's death. Although only in his 20s, he had committed numerous criminal acts that endangered others. His crimes had escalated and, as evidenced by his assault of a sheriff and an inmate while the case was pending, he continued to be a danger to others. These factors justified the life sentence. Further, appellant failed to clearly and convincingly show that because of any unusual circumstances he was a victim of the legislature's failure to assign sentences meaningfully tailored to the culpability of the offender, the gravity of the offense, and the circumstances of the case. As the trial judge apparently concluded, there were no circumstances justifying a deviation from the mandatory sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sentence affirmed. Appellant's life sentence was justified by the heinous nature of his crime, his criminal record, and his post-crime violence. Moreover, he failed to show any unusual circumstances justifying a deviation from the mandatory minimum sentence provided for the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was denied unemployment insurance benefits. On appeal, the issue was whether her employer, who admittedly failed to carry its burden at an administrative hearing of presenting competent evidence to prove that she was disqualified from receiving benefits, was entitled to a remand of the case to allow it a second opportunity to meet its burden of proof. The appeals court decided the issue in the negative. The court held that insufficient legal competent evidence was originally presented; thus it was unable to decide whether appellant was properly denied benefits. The only evidence that was admitted was based on hearsay. It also rejected the argument that remand should have been allowed so that the board of review could take additional evidence, to purge the hearsay, and expressed an unwillingness to make a finding with any certainty grounded on what was shown by the unsatisfactory record. The case was thus remanded for an award of benefits to appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order reversed. The case was remanded for the sole purpose of allowing the board of review to enter an order in accordance with the mandate of the court, awarding appellant benefits.

The appellate court granted defendant's writ application, ordering the trial court to grant defendant an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fled from a car a police officer pulled over for an expired tag. The officer saw defendant discard a bag. The officer did not see defendant discard a gun, but the officer found a gun by the bag, which contained cocaine. The appellate court found there effectively was no minimum sentence for a person convicted of attempted possession of cocaine in an amount more than 28 grams but less than 200 grams. Therefore, defendant's sentence was to be amended to delete the provision denying him the benefits of probation and parole. Further, the evidence of the recovery of the gun next to the bag had minimal relevance, but any error in admission of that evidence was harmless. Defendant was precluded from raising both the claim of excessive sentence and the claim that the trial court failed to consider the sentencing factors. Considering defendant's record and that he received a sentence of less than one-third of the maximum possible sentence to which he was exposed, it could not be said defendant's sentence was unconstitutionally excessive. Therefore, defense counsel's failure to file a motion to reconsider sentence did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of two counts of simple burglary of an inhabited dwelling, and the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), sentenced him to life imprisonment as a habitual offender. He appealed his convictions and sentence, claiming the sentence was excessive, the evidence of his guilt and his prior convictions was insufficient, and that the trial court should have granted a mistrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police saw appellant in the victim's home, chased and captured him, and found property belonging to the victim on his person. At trial, the victim testified that she had never seen appellant before, and did not give him permission to be in her home. Appellant was convicted of simple burglary of an inhabited dwelling, and because of a prior robbery and a burglary conviction, was given a mandatory life sentence under the Habitual Offender Law. He appealed; the appellate court affirmed. That the jury learned of appellant's aliases did not mean he was entitled to a mistrial, since reference to the aliases did not equate to evidence that appellant had committed another crime. The evidence was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that appellant made an authorized entry and had the intent to commit a theft or felony. Fingerprint evidence established that appellant was the same person who committed the prior felonies ascribed to him. Finally, as the life sentence was required by the Habitual Offender Law, and appellant did not meet his burden to rebut the presumption that the life sentence was constitutional, the sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed, because (1) reference to appellant's alias in the indictment read to the jury did not mandate a mistrial; (2) the evidence was sufficient to convict; (3) appellant's prior convictions were adequately proved; and (4) the life sentence was appropriate under the Habitual Offender Law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence from the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, for simple burglary under La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:62. He asserted insufficient evidence, error in denying a motion to suppress, and that the trial court erred when it adjudicated him a fourth felony offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers testified defendant was standing in an empty lot with clothing with security tags and a store's labels on them. They later learned the store was burglarized. Store's manager identified the clothes as taken from the store. Store's surveillance tapes recorded the burglary, showing a black male riding a bicycle past the store immediately before the door was smashed, the perpetrator entering the store, and the perpetrator's clothes, which matched defendant's. Defendant implicitly admitted he committed the burglary, stating to the officers he was at the store by himself. Evidence was sufficient, there was reasonable cause to detain, and probable cause to arrest. Evidence of prior guilty pleas showed he was represented by counsel and advised of his rights. Defendant produced no evidence showing an infringement of his rights or a procedural irregularity in the taking of the pleas. The applicable enhancement statute was the one existing at the time of the commission of the offense for which the sentence was to be enhanced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Police testimony of finding defendant with stolen clothing and surveillance tape from burglary showing suspect with same clothes worn by defendant, coupled with his statements he was at the store alone provided sufficient evidence for conviction. Officers had reasonable cause to detain and to arrest. There was no evidence of an infringement of rights or irregularities in prior pleas used for the enhancement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged a judgment of the Fifteenth Judicial District, Parish of LaFayette (Louisiana) granting defendant's exception of prescription after plaintiffs brought a medical malpractice action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a complaint with the state's patient compensation fund against defendant medical center on October 30, 1996, claiming that defendant was negligent in failing to screen and, thereafter, in transfusing Hepatitis C infected blood to plaintiff husband during surgery following a motorcycle accident in January 1987. The medical review panel rendered its opinion in December 1998, stating that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant breached the standard of care. Thereafter, on March 26, 1999, plaintiffs filed a medical malpractice action against defendant alleging negligence. The trial court held that plaintiffs' suit had prescribed and that &sect; 9:5628 was constitutional as it applied to plaintiff husband. Judgment was affirmed. Based on plaintiffs' failure to present any evidence that &sect; 9:5628 did not further a reasonable state interest or was not rationally related to a state interest, the appellate court found the exception of prescription was properly granted. Section 9:5628 did not unfairly discriminate against plaintiff husband based on his physical condition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment sustaining the exception of prescription in favor of defendant was affirmed, as plaintiffs failed to meet their evidentiary burden in challenging the constitutionality of the applicable statute of limitations because they did not offer any evidence that the statute furthered no state interest or was not rationally related to the state's interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State department of revenue appealed an order of the Fifteenth Judicial District, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana) finding appellee Lafayette Parish district attorney had the power to cause its tax lien to be cancelled thereby allowing appellee to unconstitutionally exercise a power exclusively reserved to the executive branch.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police seized 10 pounds of marijuana from a homeowner and various other property. Appellee recorded a notice of forfeiture lien and appellant department of revenue recorded a tax assessment and lien. The homeowner pled guilty to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and appellee district attorney filed a petition to obtain a forfeiture of all the items seized, naming only the homeowner in the forfeiture action. Appellee and the homeowner entered into a settlement agreement, but it made no reference to appellant or to either recorded lien. Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment to cancel both liens and the trial court granted it. Appellant challenged the ruling, arguing appellee did not have the authority to cause its tax lien to be cancelled. The court held nothing in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1578 provided appellee any authority over a Louisiana Department of Revenue taxation lien. The court reversed, holding the constitutional separation of powers between the executive and judicial branches precluded appellee from cancellation appellant's lien.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed, because the constitutional separation of powers between the executive and judicial branches precluded appellee district attorney from exercising the authority of the secretary of the department of revenue and taxation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was originally given a suspended sentence upon conviction of possession of marijuana. The court granted the State's motion to reconsider the sentence, as appellant was a second felony offender, and thus suspension of her sentence was prohibited. She appealed, asserting that her first conviction could not enhance her sentence because she had been pardoned, and that the ultimate sentence was excessive. The appeals court affirmed the sentence, reasoning that the automatic pardon provision under La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(E)(1) did not in and of itself alter the prohibition against certain sentence suspensions under La. Code Crim. P. art. 893(A). Moreover, despite the court's error in its assessment of the degree of discretion it had in sentencing appellant, the sentence was not excessive. Given the minimum nature of the sentence imposed, the prior felony conviction, and the benefit gained by appellant through the plea bargain, the penalty imposed was not so grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sentence affirmed. Trial court did not err in granting the State's motion and resentencing appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, part owner and manger of a casino, appealed the order of defendant, the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, that the casino's gross revenues be escrowed, arguing that the Board's actions were an unconstitutional taking without due process. Intervenor, a joint owner of the casino, intervened, but the trial court quashed its subpoenas ex parte. At a hearing on plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, the trial court granted the injunction and, at the request of plaintiff and defendant, but over intervenor's objections, made the injunction permanent and dismissed the case as moot. Intervenor appealed; the appellate court reversed. The trial court had no authority to convert the preliminary injunction to a permanent one over intervenor's objection, or to quash intervenor's subpoenas ex parte. It improperly heard both plaintiff's appeal and its preliminary injunction request, acting as an appeals court in the former matter, and as a trial court in the latter.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment, based upon a jury verdict, of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana) convicting him of manslaughter and sentencing him to 40 years in prison at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant took his new girlfriend to meet the woman, victim, with whom he was living. After an argument between defendant and the victim, the latter was shot. The victim died of a single gunshot wound from a bullet that entered her heart. The shot was fired from close range. The victim also had multiple bruises on her head, elbows, and forearms. At the police station, defendant made two tape-recorded statements, which were later played for the jury. In the first statement, he admitted shooting the victim, but claimed it was an accident. About an hour later, defendant stated he did not just run away after the shooting, but rather he tried to help the victim first. He was convicted of manslaughter. Judgment was affirmed. The jury's credibility determinations and subsequent conclusion that the shooting was not accidental were not contrary to the evidence. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of defendant's ammunition and weapons paraphernalia, as it was relevant to defendant's credibility. Remarks made by the prosecutor during closing argument were all within the scope of proper argument. Sentence imposed was not excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Based in part on defendant's poor credibility, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the manslaughter conviction. Defendant was not prejudiced by allegedly improper remarks made by the prosecutor in closing argument, as the prosecutor's remarks were supported by the evidence. Defendant's sentence was not excessive in light of sentences imposed by other courts in similar circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:89. Defendant moved to quash, on the ground that the statute under which she was charged was unconstitutional. The 24th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana) denied the motion. Defendant reserved her right to appeal, after pleading guilty, the trial court's denial of her motion to quash.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant asserted three assignments of error, all regarding the length of defendant's sentence: 1) the trial judge failed to comply with the sentencing guidelines in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1; 2) the trial court erred in imposing an excessive sentence; and 3) defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel at sentencing because her counsel failed to object to the sentence and failed to file a motion to reconsider sentence with the trial court. Pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.2A(2), defendant could not now seek review of her sentence, to which she agreed prior to her plea. The trial court incorrectly advised defendant that she had a three-year time period in which to seek post-conviction relief. However, at the time of sentencing, the time period had been shortened to two years. The trial court needed to inform the defendant of the correct provisions of the statute, by sending appropriate written notice to defendant within ten days of the opinion, and to file written proof in the record that defendant received such notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was reversed for the trial court to inform the defendant of the correct time period for filing a claim of post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued, inter alia, that medical monitoring existed as a valid cause of action at the time their suit was filed, which was prior to the legislature's adoption of an amendment to La.

Plaintiffs claimed that the amendment to art. 2315 created new law and that its application to their cause of action deprived them of a constitutionally vested right because it was written after the filing of their suit. The appellate court reversed the trial court's decision, concluding that the statutory amendment made a substantive change in the law. Thus, the amendment could not be applied retroactively so as to deprive plaintiffs in this case of their vested rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:9092 created appellant Garden District's Security Special Taxing District and a tax. The district court found &sect; 33:9092&nbsp;unconstitutional and granted appellees, tenant and company, a preliminary injunction of implementation of its tax. On suspensive appeal, the Louisiana Supreme Court vacated the unconstitutionality finding and transferred the matter to the court for a determination as to the preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:9092 created appellant Garden District's Security Special Taxing District, designated the composition of its board of directors, and authorized a five-year property tax on property within the district provided that voters approved it, which they did. Appellees, tenant and company, alleged &sect; 33:9092 to be unconstitutional and were granted a preliminary injunction suspending implementation of the tax. The court vacated the injunction and remanded. There was neither irreparable injury nor a due process violation sufficient to justify the injunction. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2110, unlawful levying of a tax was fully compensable in money. Enjoining appellant possibly would have led to citizens being subject to various crimes such as battery, which would be difficult to compensate with money. Thus, under a duty-risk analysis, the injunction was unwarranted. The court restricted St. Raymond v. City of New Orleans, 769 So. 2d 562, which required no showing of irreparable harm where the action sought to be enjoined directly violated a vested &quot;state property&quot; right, to its specific facts involving construction and building permit revocation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was vacated and the matter remanded. Appellees made no showing of a sufficient due process violation or irreparable harm. An unlawful tax could be compensated with money. Enjoining appellant might have led to more serious and difficult-to-compensate harms to citizens. The court restricted the holding of a pertinent case cited by appellees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by bill of information with possession of cocaine. The trial court denied the defendant's motion to suppress the evidence. Defendant was found guilty of attempted possession of cocaine. The Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana) adjudicated the defendant a third-felony habitual offender and sentenced the defendant to life imprisonment at hard labor. The trial court granted the defendant's motion for appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the trial court erred in admitting irrelevant evidence consisting of 2 AK 47 assault rifles, boxes of ammunition for the guns, drug paraphernalia, 2 plastic bags containing a total of 40 pieces of crack cocaine, and several bags of powdered cocaine. Defendant was barred from raising this issue on appeal. Considering that defense counsel allowed all of this testimony concerning the firearms and contraband, it could not be said that the defendant was prejudiced by the routine admission of physical evidence. The appellate court could not say that trial counsel's failure to attack a prior guilty plea at the trial court level prejudiced the defendant. As to whether defendant's sentences were excessive, defendant's three offenses were nonviolent drug offenses and were not sufficient alone to declare his sentence excessive. The record suggested that the defendant was simply a drug addict who might not be deserving of the minimum mandatory life sentence provided by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(b)(ii).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed, but the sentence was vacated, and the case was remanded for resentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana) denying his motion for new trial after a jury convicted him of two counts of first degree robbery. After adjudicating defendant a second felony offender on each count, the trial court sentenced defendant to serve 30 years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence on each count, to be served consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of twice robbing a video store where he had once worked. The cashier on duty during both robberies gave police a general description of the suspect. The cashier and defendant had worked two shifts together at the video store when defendant was briefly employed there as a security guard. Defendant denied involvement in the robberies. He did, however, admit ownership of a ring identified by the cashier as the ring worn by the perpetrator. On appeal, defendant contended the State failed to prove his identity as the person who committed the crimes. Defendant's conviction was affirmed, as the cashier positively identified defendant. In addition, the jury was able to view the store's surveillance videotapes from both robberies. Defendant's sentences were vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing because the sentences were imposed before defendant's motions for new trial and post verdict judgment of acquittal were disposed of. Defendant's adjudications and sentences as a second felony offender were reversed, as the State failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove that a prior guilty plea on a narcotics charge was knowingly and voluntarily made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convictions were affirmed, sentences were vacated, and case was remanded for resentencing. Surveillance videotapes of robberies provided sufficient evidence to corroborate store cashier's testimony regarding the identify of perpetrator. The State provided insufficient documentation regarding defendant's alleged prior narcotics offense committed in another state. Thus, the trial court erred when it adjudicated defendant a second felony offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case arising out of a collision between an automobile and a train, plaintiff sought supervisory relief from a judgment of the Sixteenth Judicial District Court of Iberia (Louisiana), which upheld the constitutionality of 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 409, thereby precluding plaintiff from discovering certain evidence vital to her case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff moved to compel the production of records of defendant Department of Transportation and Development pertaining to the railroad crossing where the collision occurred. Defendant opposed the discovery requests on the basis of 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 409, which regulated discovery and admission of certain reports and surveys of railway highway crossings. Plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 409 on two grounds, that application of the statute deprived her of due process and an adequate remedy under U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, as well as the Louisiana Constitution; and that the statute violated U.S. Const. amend. X and La. Const. art. 12, &sect; 10, which provided that neither the state nor any state agency shall have been immune from suit and liability for injury to person or property. The court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 409. Defendant was not immune from suit and liability, and plaintiff's constitutional rights to due process and an adequate remedy were not abrogated. Other entities could provide plaintiff with the information she sought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Federal statute regulating discovery and admission of certain reports and surveys of railway highway crossings was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another man robbed a cab driver of his money at gunpoint and fled.

An hour after the robbery the police took the cab driver to the men and he identified the men as the robbers. Defendant had approximately the amount of money stolen on him, but the gun was not found. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence. Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to 10 years. The court found the identification was admissible. The evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt defendant was guilty of armed robbery. The sentence imposed was proper and the minimum allowed under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed suit against defendants for denial of tenure allegedly based on national origin, in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1981, 1983, as well as La.

On appeal, plaintiff argued the district court erred in that it made incorrect factual findings and conclusions of law and made unreasonable evaluations of credibility. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, finding no reversible error. The appellate court reasoned that, based upon the undisputed facts, the record revealed plaintiff had not proven that there was discrimination on the basis of his national origin or ancestry. The appellate court noted that the overwhelming evidence, as determined by the district court, was that plaintiff was not qualified for his particular position inasmuch as he could not effectively communicate in English; his research was of an inadequate level; and his public service achievements were minimal, if any.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the judgment because the record revealed evidence from which a fact finder could reasonably conclude that defendant's decision to deny tenure was not based on plaintiff's national origin or ancestry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated personal injury cases arising out of a two-car collision, plaintiffs sued each other and multiple defendants. After some of the defendants were dismissed based on settlements, the 22nd Judicial District Court Parish of St. Tammany, Louisiana, apportioned fault between plaintiffs, defendant driver, defendant bar, and defendant state agency. Plaintiffs and defendant state agency appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Employees of defendant bar placed a passed-out patron, defendant driver, in his car. Later that night, plaintiff bartender followed defendant driver as he drove away. Defendant driver crossed the center line of a highway, causing plaintiff driver to swerve off the road. Plaintiff driver swerved back onto the road and collided with plaintiff bartender. In consolidated cases, plaintiffs sued defendants for their injuries, and the trial court apportioned damages. The appellate court reversed the allocation of fault to defendant bar because a causal link to establish the liability of defendant bar was not established. The court re-allocated the fault, placing fault on plaintiff driver for imprudently swerving back onto the road and placing fault on defendant state agency and defendant driver. The court determined that there was no limitation on defendant state agency's liability for general damages and that the general damage awards were not excessive. However, the court reversed the awards for loss of future earning capacity. Also, due to the pre-trial settlement between the plaintiffs, defendant state agency was solidarily liable for only 50 percent of plaintiffs' damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was reversed regarding apportionment of fault and awards for loss of future earning capacity, but was affirmed regarding general damage awards.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff commenced a new action, which was unsuccessful in the trial court, seeking damages and an injunction, arguing that defendant revoked his license based on insufficient evidence and that he did not receive due process at his hearing. The court held that plaintiff's action was in essence an appeal of the administrative proceeding rather than an independent action.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4788 required that an appeal of a trial court's decision in a liquor license had to be filed within 10 days and that an appeal from a judgment relating to a preliminary injunction had to be taken within 15 days. Since plaintiff failed to meet either deadline, the court lacked jurisdiction to hear his appeal at all.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Eighteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of West Baton Rouge, State of Louisiana, plaintiffs sued to enjoin defendant from enforcing subdivision regulations and to have the regulations declared null and void. Defendant filed an exception raising the objection of no cause of action. The trial court sustained the exception and dismissed the lawsuit. Plaintiff corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that subdivision regulations requiring the installation of fire hydrants were invalid. The trial court found that the regulations were adopted according to law by a governmental body authorized to establish such regulations. The instant court affirmed. The Louisiana Constitution and state statutes gave local governments broad power to adopt regulations for land use. State law designated a &quot;planning commission&quot; as the agency to establish such regulations, but allowed that a home rule charter could avail itself of the authority granted to a planning commission. West Baton Rouge Parish's home rule charter delegated that power to defendant. Thus, defendant was authorized to establish the regulations plaintiffs challenged. Defendant's exception establishes that the adoption of the regulations was as provided by law. Plaintiffs had no remedy available to them, and the trial court was not obligated to allow them to amend their petition where such amendment would be futile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order sustaining a no cause of action exception was affirmed. The parish's home rule charter delegated to defendant the authority to establish zoning regulations, and defendant established the challenged regulations according to law; thus, plaintiffs had no available remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, adoptive parents, filed an application for approval of the adoption of petitioner father's daughter after agreeing with the child's mother and her former husband for the voluntary surrender of the child. Sometime after the child was placed with respondents, petitioner informed respondents that he was the child's biological father and filed a petition for paternity. Respondents then filed an exception on the grounds that petitioner's actions to annul the adoption were untimely. The trial court granted respondents' exception but ordered paternity testing. After tests showed petitioner to be the child's biological father, petitioner filed a petition to revoke respondents' adoption of his daughter. Respondents then filed an exception on the grounds of res judicata. On reconsideration, the trial court granted respondents' exception and dismissed the petition to revoke. The appellate court reversed and remanded. Res judicata applied to the validity of the mother's acts of surrender and not to petitioner's challenge. Petitioner was not precluded by res judicata from challenging the adoption of his daughter.</SPAN></P>

Each claim was based on a single tax year. The trial court had designated its judgment of prescription as to the five oldest claims final.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For 6 years appellee tax commission assessed taxes on appellant's public service property at 25 percent of fair market value. For each of these years appellant paid and filed yearly written protests with appellee. After many delays, appellee dismissed appellant's protests, making the initial determinations final. Appellant pipe line company appealed to the district court. The district court granted appellee's exceptions of no cause of action and prescription, and dismissed appellant's claims as to the five oldest tax years, designating the partial judgment as final. Appellant filed appeal from the partial judgment. The appellate court noted that the legislature had provided two separate remedies, one for public service property, excluding land, and one for all other property subject to taxation. The district court had failed to apply the procedure of review of the tax assessment of public service property. The court found that appellant had properly followed the procedure set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1856 to challenge a public service property assessment by waiting for a final determination by appellee and then filing in district court within 30 days thereafter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the district court and remanded the case for further proceedings because the suit had been timely filed under the procedures for challenging assessment of tax against public service properties.</SPAN></P>

There was no direct evidence linking defendant to the fire. The neighborhood had been the scene of numerous acts of vandalism in the time period of the crime. Moreover, the defendant's belongings were in the house trailer at the time of the fire, including family pictures. There was much testimony regarding the defendant's anguished state after the fire.

PCF applied for supervisory writ when its motion for protective order was denied by the trial court. The trial court acted with the great discretion afforded it in allowing the discovery process to proceed in the instant matter. The court was convinced that the Louisiana legislature, by enacting La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In light of one of its recent rulings, Supreme Court of Louisiana remanded case for court to reconsider its decision that life sentence, imposed pursuant to Habitual Offender Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(b)(ii), was excessive punishment for defendant's third-offense, when third offense was purse snatching.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In it's first opinion, the court held that the imposition of a life sentence pursuant to the &quot;three strikes&quot; provision of the Habitual Offender Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(b)(ii), was excessive for purse snatching. Purse snatching was a &quot;crime of violence&quot; under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:2(13)(z). Defendant had two prior convictions for simple burglary. The trial court found no circumstance permitting it to deviate from the statutorily mandated sentence. The record disclosed nothing indicating the trial judge abused his discretion, albeit during the commission of the crime defendant was unarmed, the victim was not physically harmed, and the victim's property was recovered. By its very nature, the act of snatching a purse involved a physical act that placed the victim at risk for physical injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Original decree vacated, and sentence of life imprisonment reinstated upon defendant. Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding there were no circumstances permitting it to deviate from minimum sentence mandated by Louisiana Habitual Offender Law; thus life sentence for defendant for crime of purse snatching was proper, because he was habitual offender and purse snatching was crime of violence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a conviction for aggravated battery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:(27)30.1 from Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana) which adjudicated the defendant a third felony offender, vacated his original sentence, and sentenced him pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 to life imprisonment at hard labor with credit for time served.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the evidence did not support his conviction of aggravated battery. He argued the State did not disprove he acted in self-defense. The defendant admitted that he and the victim were engaged in an argument over money and that he armed himself with a box cutter and began to swing at the victim. The injury, therefore, was a reasonably certain consequence. The State negated the defendant's justification defense. Defendant claimed the State produced insufficient evidence of his identity for purposes of adjudicating him a third felony offender. Testimony comparing defendant's fingerprints with fingerprints found on prior arrest records was sufficient to prove defendant was the person convicted of the prior offenses. Because defendant's third conviction was for aggravated battery, a crime of violence as defined by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:2(13), the mandatory life sentence as a third felony habitual offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(b)(ii) was not excessive. Considering his extensive criminal record and propensity for crimes of violence, he fit the profile of the recidivist the Habitual Offender Law was enacted to contain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction affirmed. The State negated the defendant's justification defense and proved the defendant's identity as the person who committed the predicate offenses. His life sentence as a third felony offender was not constitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Louisiana Gaming Control Board presented an appeal and an application for supervisory review seeking a rehearing of a decision by the Nineteenth Judicial District Court on judicial review of the board's conditional approval of a transfer of an interest in a riverboat gaming license. The court found a transferee was required to receive prior approval before the transfer could take place and ordered the board to conduct a public hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court decided the review of a resolution by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board should have been conducted under its supervisory jurisdiction.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 27:26, 27:89 were read in conjunction with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49 of the Louisiana Administrative Procedure Act to limit appeals from the board to final decisions resulting from adjudications. The district court lacked authority to review the matter on appeal. While remand for exercise of the district court's supervisory jurisdiction was proper, the court accepted the case under its supervisory jurisdiction. Because emergency provisions were not utilized, the board's resolution which purported to &quot;conditionally approve&quot; the transfer of a gaming license was not authorized. Outside the emergency provisions, which were not activated, actual transfer could take place only after prescribed requirements had been met. The district court did not err in ordering the board to conduct a public hearing. To hold otherwise would have been to allow a subsequent transferee of a gaming license to avoid the public scrutiny to which the original licensee or permittee was subjected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Resolution of Louisiana Gaming Control Board vacated and remanded for public hearing. Appeal dismissed because resolution was not a final appealable adjudication. Writ granted and made peremptory. Conditional prior approval of transfer of gaming license was not authorized by the gaming provisions; approval of transfer of license could only have been given after prescribed requirements had been met.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who was incarcerated, raised three alleged evidentiary errors and also alleged the trial court was manifestly erroneous in finding he was an unfit parent and in denying his claim for parental rights.

The trial court did not commit manifest error in finding that appellant failed to provide financial support, food, clothing, shelter, or treatment for the child, either before or after the child's birth; or that appellant was unable to provide an adequate permanent home for the child, and that, based on his past conduct, including criminal convictions for violent crimes, he could pose a risk of substantial harm to the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgement of Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court Parish of Jefferson, State of Louisiana, convicting him of aggravated battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted of aggravated battery, and appealed. The court affirmed. Defendant's objection to a policeman's testimony about defendant's prior statements, on grounds it varied from his testimony at the suppression hearing, was properly denied. Defendant failed to file a motion under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 716(C) for discovery of any statements he made to police, and could not complain of the variance in testimony; in any event, the &quot;variance&quot; was insubstantial. Defendant's claim of insufficiency of the evidence to convict was meritless, as several eyewitnesses identified him as the shooter. Defendant's claim that the battery statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34, was unconstitutionally broad because it did not require that the battery occur without the victim's consent was rejected. Because the battery statute affected conduct, not speech, and conduct that was harmful and controlled by criminal laws, application of the overbreadth doctrine was inappropriate. The court found error patent in the court's failure to inform defendant of the time limits for seeking post-conviction relief and the case was remanded so this notice could be given.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed, because officer's testimony was properly admitted, as no discovery violation occurred; evidence was sufficient to convict; and the aggravated battery statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad. Case was remanded with instructions to the trial court to advise defendant of time limits for filing motions for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, appellant contended that the juvenile court committed manifest error by terminating his parental rights pursuant to La. Child. Code art. 1138. The appellate court found, however, that appellant had failed to establish a viable relationship with the two children. Specifically, appellant had a significant drinking problem for which he refused to seek treatment or any other established recovery program, appellant and the mother of the children were prone to bouts of violence toward each other, and appellant was not listed on either child's birth certificate as the father in an apparent attempt to avoid having to provide financial support for the children. Additionally, the appellate court found that appellant could not reasonably provide a stable environment for the children based on his work hours and the lack of immediate assistance from any family members. As such, the judgment of the juvenile court to terminate appellant's parental rights was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the juvenile court was affirmed because appellant failed to demonstrate that he was a fit parent inasmuch as appellant had a significant continued drinking problem, appellant failed to provide support for the children, and appellant failed to provide evidence that he had established a substantial commitment to the children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted obscenity. He argued that the trial court erroneously adjudicated him to be a fourth felony offender. Defendant did not file a motion to quash the multiple bill or object to the failure of the State to prove that the cleansing periods had not elapsed at the multiple bill hearing; thus, the issue was not preserved for appellate review. The documents presented by the State reflected that 10 years had not passed between each offense, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(C); thus, defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object based on the cleansing period argument. Defendant had been convicted of seven felonies between 1982 and 1999. Also, the facts indicated that defendant was attempting to force sexual intercourse on the victim. Thus, defendant's sentence to life imprisonment was not unconstitutionally excessive. Defendant's convictions for simple battery and attempted obscenity did not violate his right against double jeopardy because although the two convictions arose from the same transaction, the evidence for each offense was completely separate and distinct. Thus, the two convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed dismissal of their claims premised on the alleged negligence of a government employee because they failed to timely serve him. The trial court found plaintiffs failed to show good cause for withholding service beyond the 90-day period prescribed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5107(D) and also denied plaintiffs' constitutional challenges to the statute. The former holding was affirmed, while the latter was reversed, based on the premise the court pretermitted the question, on grounds that the question was not ripe. The court was not willing to determine whether the statute was constitutional because said resolution was unnecessary to decide the case. Until plaintiffs filed a second suit naming all the defendants and reasserting the claims which were the subject of the present dismissal, the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5107(D)(3) was not at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part. Judgment dismissing plaintiffs' claims without prejudice affirmed as plaintiffs could not show good cause why they failed to serve defendant within prescription period. Judgment reversed on that portion addressing the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5107(D)(3) as issue was not ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted purse snatching, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:65.1, and possession of cocaine, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967. The purse snatching offense was considered a violent felony and, based on that and prior convictions, defendant was sentenced as a third-time offender. As a result, he received a life sentence without the possibility of parole, probation, or suspension. He appealed his conviction and sentence. The instant court affirmed. Defendant's life sentence was mandatory pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(2)(b)(ii) and was not unconstitutionally excessive. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel. Because the prosecutor's &quot;other crimes&quot; evidence was proper, counsel was not ineffective for failing to move for mistrial. Nor was counsel ineffective for failing to move to quash the multiple bill; despite a clerical error in the bill, defendant was aware of what predicate offense he was being charge with. The State presented sufficient evidence to establish defendant's prior guilty plea was informed and voluntary. Finally, the trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant to change his plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of second-degree murder, and sentence thereon, in the Ninth Judicial District Court, Rapides Parish (Louisiana), arguing primarily that evidence of intent and of presence at the crime scene was insufficient, that trial court erred in denying a change of venue, and that his sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and several friends were convicted of murdering an elderly woman. Evidence indicated that defendant did not actively help stab the victim, so the jury convicted him of second-degree rather than first-degree murder. The court held that since the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of first-degree murder, it was certainly sufficient to convict him of second-degree murder. Although the case generated considerable publicity, it was not so inflammatory as to raise a presumption of prejudice. Because defendant failed to show actual prejudice, there was no error in denying him a change of venue. There was no error in excluding co-defendants' statements as hearsay, because defendant failed to show that their statements were reliable. Defendant's challenges to rejection of proposed jury instructions failed because the general charge was adequate. Finally, review of defendant's sentence was precluded by his failure to move for reconsideration. However, his life sentence was mandatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed judgment; since evidence was sufficient to prove first-degree murder, it was more than enough for second-degree. Co-defendants' statements were not admissible because they were not shown to be reliable. Publicity was not so inflammatory that court would presume prejudice. Sentence was mandatory, and anyhow, defendant waived review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from a judgment of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana in her medical malpractice action in favor of defendant physician. The district court rejected her challenge that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628 was unconstitutional under the La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 (1974) equal protection provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient had brought a medical malpractice action against defendant physician. An appeal of the action had been remanded for plaintiff to properly raise a constitutional challenge to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628 under the La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 (1974) equal protection provisions. The circuit court rejected her constitutionality challenge, and entered judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed. Plaintiff argued &sect; 9:5628 established a per se negligence distinction between defendants who were healthcare professionals and other defendants. The court determined that distinction was not included within the equal protection classes of &sect; 3, which were birth, age, sex, culture, physical condition, or political ideas or affiliations. Therefore to show unconstitutionality plaintiff had to show the &sect; 9:5628 distinction did not have a reasonable basis. The court determined plaintiff did not do that. The legislature's purpose, recognized by a prior case, to reduce the proliferation of malpractice suits to control health care costs, was a legitimate state interest. The statute was constitutional. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The challenge to the statute based on the distinction between per se negligence classification for medical malpractice and other suits did not fall under enumerated constitutionally protected classes. Plaintiff did not prove the statute did not suitably further any appropriate state interest. The stated interest furthered was to reduce proliferation of medical malpractice actions to lower medical costs.</SPAN></P>

The victim testified that he was surprised, scared, intimidated, and believed the defendant would try to hurt him in order to get his money. Rational trier of fact could have reasonably concluded that the act of jumping into the victim's vehicle and demanding money was a use of force and intimidation sufficient to prove the necessary element of attempted simple robbery. Trial court did not err by allowing the State to present evidence of an earlier burglary. Other crimes evidence was properly evaluated as circumstantial evidence of defendant's specific intent. The mandatory life sentence imposed pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(b)(ii) was not unconstitutionally excessive. Defendant had a continuous propensity to commit crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendants, alleging that plaintiff employee sustained injuries due to the breaking of a turnbuckle assembly on a waste disposal truck. Defendant manufacturer and defendant parent corporation (parent) each filed exceptions of lack of personal jurisdiction. The trial court denied defendant manufacturer's exception, but sustained defendant parent's exception. Plaintiffs appealed the decision to sustain defendant parent's exception. The appellate court held that the mere existence of a parent-subsidiary relationship between defendant parent and defendant manufacturer would not support the assertion of jurisdiction over defendant parent unless defendant parent so dominated defendant manufacturer that they did not in reality constitute separate and distinct corporate entities. However, plaintiffs failed to establish that defendant parent exercised the degree of control over defendant manufacturer necessary to support an exercise of personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs also failed to establish the existence of minimum contacts with Louisiana due to the conduct of defendant parent. Consequently, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a tip concerning drug sales and surveillance of defendant seller transacting, police got a warrant for a house, and after more surveillance searched it and found wrapped heroin. Defendant purchaser who had driven away was also arrested with heroin. Defendants were convicted respectively of distribution of heroin and possession with intent to distribute it, and possession, defendant purchaser as a third felony offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, and both life-sentenced. The court affirmed. As defendants were charged differently, there was no possibility of antagonistic defenses; thus joint trial was not improper. Warrant was justified because surveillance corroborated informant's detailed tip. Evidence sufficiently showed intent to distribute, and police reports' discrepancies were unrelated to elements of crimes. Guilty plea and waiver of rights forms to previous offenses showed defendant purchaser's guilty pleas to predicate offenses had been voluntary. Thus defendant purchaser's trial counsel was not deficient for failing to move to quash the multiple bills of information. As state did not raise issue, illegally lenient sentence was not corrected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurer challenged a judgment of the Plaquemines 25th Judicial District Court (Louisiana), awarding the sum of $ 11,048, plus penalties and attorney fees, to plaintiff insured after defendant failed to pay full claim amount for hail damage to roofs of plaintiff's house and barn.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contacted defendant claiming the roofs of his house and barn were damaged in a hail storm. Defendant retained a property damage adjuster to inspect the damage. The adjuster found extensive damage and estimated the repairs would have cost $ 15,646. Believing the roofs had sustained only minor damage, defendant retained a roof inspector to assess plaintiff property for hail damage. The inspector found damage to only 13 shingles and estimated replacement costs at $ 480. In light of the inspector's opinion, defendant refused to pay plaintiff for the replacement of the roofs. Dissatisfied, plaintiff obtained another estimate of the damage. This third assessor recommended both roofs be replaced. Defendant failed to make any additional payments. Plaintiff successfully sued defendant. Upon review, the court found defendant's handling of plaintiff's claim was arbitrary and capricious and therefore warranted the assessment of penalties and attorney fees. Defendant arbitrarily chose to ignore the appraisal of plaintiff's loss by its own appraiser. Judgment was amended to award interest on statutory penalties from date of legal judgment rather than from date of judicial demand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed as amended; defendant's failure to pay plaintiff's hail damage claim, even after a third appraisal was done estimating that the roofs needed replacement, was arbitrary and capricious. Penalties and attorney fees were appropriately awarded in favor of plaintiff. Trial court's judgment was amended to award interest on penalties from date of judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the Criminal District Court Orleans Parish's (Louisiana) denial of his motion to suppress, his conviction for possession of heroin in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(C)(1), his adjudication as a third felony habitual offender, and his sentence purportedly pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(b)(ii) to life imprisonment without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence, with credit for time served.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Eight police officers went to investigate a drug selling complaint. Upon arrival, an officer saw a man handing defendant money and defendant holding a plastic bag with several white objects and tin foil. Defendant fled, was caught, and found to have a syringe and bottle cap. Defendant said he was selling fake cocaine for his heroin habit. Residue in the bottle cap and foil, too small to weigh, tested positive for heroin. Defendant was convicted of possession of heroin, adjudicated a third felony habitual offender, and sentenced to life (not without the possibility of parole). The court affirmed. Police had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant. Though the amount of heroin was negligible, it supported the conviction. Defendant could be paroled after 20 years under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:574.4(A)(3), so his sentence was not cruel. Defendant's prior two felonies were not drug related or caused; thus, he was not sentenced for being an addict. Defendant had four prior convictions, an extensive juvenile record, and offered no evidence as to his redeeming qualities; his sentence, even if harsh, was not excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction and sentence were affirmed. Non-weighable amount of heroin was adequate for possession conviction. Defendant admitted he was a heroin addict and had been trying to complete a fake drug sale to support his habit. Defendant's sentence allowed for the possibility of parole, he had made no showing of redeeming qualities, and his prior record was extensive; thus the sentence was justified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), convicting and sentencing him, as a second felony offender, for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and for possession of heroin. The trial court had denied defendant's motions to suppress a statement and evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested in his aunt's home based on a warrant. In a search incident to the arrest, an officer found a syringe with heroin residue on defendant, who was arrested a second time. A rifle magazine with live rounds in it was subsequently found in the bedroom defendant had been occupying. When questioned, defendant denied any knowledge of an assault rifle, but he stated the drugs and the handgun belonged to him. A more detailed search of the bedroom revealed, inter alia, 10 packets of heroin and a handgun. Defendant wanted his statement and the drug and weapon evidence suppressed. He argued he was not able to voluntarily waive his rights as he was intoxicated from the heroin he had recently ingested. Upon review, the court found that because defendant was alert enough to communicate with arresting officers without any problems, he was not so intoxicated that he could not have comprehended the consequences of his acts. Defendant's statement gave the officers probable cause to conduct a continued search of the bedroom. Finally, the syringe containing heroin residue that was found on defendant's person was sufficient to sustain the possession of heroin conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed; evidence presented at suppression hearing and at trial was insufficient to prove that defendant's alleged intoxication at time of arrest was sufficient to vitiate the voluntariness of his incriminating statement to police. Because officers had information that defendant, a convicted felon and parolee, was in possession of a weapon, they had probable cause to search bedroom which defendant had been occupying.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, convictions and sentences for possession of firearm by convicted felon, four counts of armed robbery, aggravated kidnapping, and second degree murder, with concurrent prison sentences, all at hard labor, life sentences to be followed by other concurrent sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two others robbed a supermarket early one morning. All were armed. One remained in the car. Defendant and the other entered the store and committed the robbery, but police arrived while they were there. Defendant left through the back, kidnapping an arriving employee. The other two drove away but soon wrecked the car and were arrested. Defendant was arrested the next day, after the employee's body was found. Her vehicle was found near his house. He was convicted of armed robbery, illegal firearms possession, kidnapping, and second-degree murder, and sentenced to hard labor on each count, with concurrent sentences consecutive to life sentences for the kidnap-murder. Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence and claimed the trial court erred by refusing to sever the firearms charge from the other charges, in denying change of venue, denying his motion for new trial based on misjoinder and failure to disclose secret agreements with his accomplices, and denying his motion to reconsider his sentences as excessive. The appellate court affirmed, upheld the lower court rulings, finding the evidence against him overwhelming and the sentences justified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convictions and sentences were affirmed. Totality of evidence was overwhelmingly sufficient to establish defendant's guilt. Any prejudice from defendant's prior conviction was too remote to matter. Denying change of venue or other motions was not abuse of discretion. Consecutive sentences were justified, as defendant kidnapped and murdered victim after completing other crimes.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, the trial court erred in imposing an unconstitutionally excessive sentence upon him and in failing to advise him of his constitutional rights prior to the commencement of the habitual offender hearing. Further, defendant argued his counsel was ineffective due to lack of knowledge of the case. The court affirmed the conviction, noting that defendant waived formal arraignment on the habitual offender bill, and thus, gave up his right to advice of his habitual offender rights. Additionally, the court determined the record did not support defendant's claim's of his counsel's unfamiliarity with his case. However, the court considered certain peculiar factors, including the allegation that defendant was mentally disabled, to be significant and important enough to justify remanding the matter for the purpose of allowing the trial court to receive evidence and determine whether sufficient grounds existed to depart from the mandatory life sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction because the record did not support defendant's claim's of ineffective assistance of counsel.

Plaintiff contended her constitutional rights of due process were violated because of the retroactive application of the amendment to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 561 which changed the statute of limitations from five years to three years. The legislature provided for a delay of one year before the amended form of the article was to become effective. This provision gave those who were to be affected by the change in the law the opportunity to take whatever actions were necessary to preserve their rights. Plaintiff had adequate notice of the impending change in the law and was not deprived of a vested right. Thus, retroactive application of La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 561 did not deprive plaintiff of any constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. A statute did not violate the constitutional prohibition against divesting a vested right provided it allowed a reasonable time for those affected by the act to assert their rights. Allowing one year from the date of enactment before enforcement of the new three year statute of limitations was reasonable and retroactive application did not deprive plaintiff of any constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 14:89(A)(2) was unconstitutionally vague, because it failed to make clear on its face exactly what behavior was proscribed. The court agreed with, and was bound by, the conclusion reached by the Louisiana Supreme Court and a long line of jurisprudence, that &sect; 14:89(A)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague. It remanded the case however, to allow the district court to correct the error of having failed to advise defendant of the prescriptive period for post conviction relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed suit when she was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 1996 against defendants hospital and blood center, alleging that she contracted the disease in 1980, when she was given a blood transfusion during childbirth. Hepatitis C was a disease with a latency period of greater than three years. The attorney general was included in the action because the plaintiff attacked the constitutionality of the three-year prescriptive period of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628. Plaintiff had filed her claim within one year of the date of discovery of her cause of action. She contended the statute violated La. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 3, 22, on the basis that its application deprived her of due process of law and access to the courts, and unfairly discriminated against her on the basis of physical condition. The court followed the supreme court, which upheld the constitutionality of the statute when challenged on these grounds. Since plaintiff failed to specifically plead with particularity her additional claims of unconstitutionality, her additional claims were not properly before the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for striking an officer while incarcerated and sentenced as a habitual offender to 27 years at hard labor. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because the State's witnesses testified that the attack occurred while defendant was an inmate at the correctional center. While the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of simple battery and by failing to list attempted battery as a responsive verdict, the error was harmless because defendant failed to prove that he was prejudiced by the error. The court reversed defendant's sentence, because there was no clear and convincing evidence showing that defendant was exceptional and therefore was entitled to a lesser sentence than that mandated for habitual offenders. Defendant caused serious bodily injury to the officer by breaking his nose and did not admit to his crimes by entering an Alford plea to his previous manslaughter conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed because the evidence was sufficient and because the trial court committed harmless error by failing to instruct the jury on a lesser-included offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for attempted possession of cocaine. His appeal was granted. At a subsequent hearing on a multiple bill, defendant's original sentence was vacated and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial court ordered that the multiple bill proceedings be incorporated into the appeal. Preliminarily, the court noted that defendant's sentence was illegally lenient, but could not have been corrected on appeal. As to the glass pipe with cocaine residue which defendant was seen to discard while sitting on a porch, the court found that as it was visible to any casual visitor, the officer's observation of it did not violate any reasonable expectation of privacy in the porch or adjacent yard. The court reviewed the presentence investigation report ordered by the trial judge and concluded that he complied with the sentencing guidelines in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, and there was an adequate factual basis for the multiple offender sentence. Because the evidence reflected that defendant was a 35 year-old with a history of violent crimes and a total inability to change his life, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, finding that evidence of a cocaine pipe discarded in a front yard was properly admitted, that the trial judge adequately complied with sentencing guidelines, and that defendant's history of crime warranted his life sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences for two counts of illegal possession, because there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant intentionally possessed items of value which had been the subject of a theft, where the circumstances indicated that defendant knew that those items were the subject of a theft. However, defendant's conviction and sentence for one count of illegal possession was reversed due to insufficient evidence. Defendant's conviction and sentence for firearm possession was affirmed, because there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant had constructive possession of the guns and drugs found in his apartment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), convicting him of possession of cocaine under La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to possession of cocaine under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(C).

The appellate court, first, affirmed defendant's conviction, ruling that defendant's motion to suppress evidence was properly denied, because the police officers--albeit without a warrant--had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant. Second, the appellate court vacated defendant's sentence insofar as it ordered defendant to pay $ 1,000 to the &quot;judicial expense fund,&quot; because: (1) pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc.

Third, the appellate court affirmed defendant's sentence in all other respects, because defendant failed to show that the conditions imposed upon his probation were financially excessive or that they militated against the success of his probation.

The trial court did not err by denying appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea without a hearing because it was not required to hold a hearing as appellant failed to present any evidence showing his plea was not knowingly and intelligently made because he misunderstood the venue issue. Appellant's plea was not rendered involuntary because the trial court failed to advise him of the sex offender registration requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because appellant failed to show that his guilty plea to a prior armed robbery charge infringed on his rights or had a procedural irregularity, appellant's sentence was not excessive, and appellant failed to show that his guilty plea was involuntary based upon his misunderstanding of venue.</SPAN></P>

Docket No. 02-97-482. Honorable Michael Erwin, Judge Presiding.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CONVICTION AND SENTENCE AFFIRMED.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction for manslaughter, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:31, and sentence to 20 years at hard labor from the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, State of Louisiana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facts established the defendant, although perhaps initially provoked by the victim, was the aggressor at the time of the killing. The court correctly held the proposed testimony of the victim's bad or overt acts toward the defendant inadmissible. Any slight probative value of the testimony was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, and waste of time. Self-defense was not supported by the evidence at trial, and thus the defendant was not entitled to a self-defense jury instruction. The defense presented no indicia of the defendant's insanity at the time of the offense, and thus failed to show good cause for a change of plea. There was no error in the denial of the motion to suppress the victim's statements on the 911 tape, since they were not hearsay. The statements were made under the immediate pressure of the crime, were not a narration of the crime after its occurrence, and formed one continuous transaction in conjunction with the crime. The trial court adequately considered the statutory criteria and did not manifestly abuse its discretion in imposing the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction affirmed. There was no evidence defendant was in imminent danger of losing her life or receiving great bodily harm and she had to kill the victim to save herself. Any prejudice to defendant's confrontation rights caused by playing of victim's statements concerning stabbing certainly was not unfair. Sentence was not grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offense, and thus was not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court did not err by finding that appellant was not entitled to subrogation from the settlement between appellee and the state because the medical insurance policy between appellee and appellant provided only a right of subrogation against a liability insurer, and the state was statutorily excluded from the definition of &quot;insurer.&quot; No donation of a public thing in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant female struck up a conversation with victim as he was leaving a bar. While she was talking to him, victim noticed someone enter his vehicle and remove his gun. After that, defendant male approached and said he knew who took the gun and would get it back for victim. The victim later invited defendants back to his house. Defendants partied with victim then left an hour later. The next morning, defendants returned to victim's house. Defendant male put a knife to victim's side and defendants proceeded to rob victim. On appeal, the court found the testimony of victim alone was sufficient to sustain the robbery convictions. Victim's drinking alcohol the night before the robbery did not make his subsequent identifications unreliable. Appellate review of defendant female's claim of excessive sentence was precluded by her failure to file a new motion for reconsideration of sentence after the trial court re-sentenced her as a habitual offender. The trial court did not err in finding the State's proof was sufficient to use defendant male's convictions as predicates in the multiple bill adjudication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed; victim's testimony provided sufficient evidence to sustain robbery convictions.

Mandatory life sentence imposed on defendant female was not unconstitutionally excessive and trial court properly concluded defendant male was a fourth felony offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana) convicting him, upon a jury verdict, of aggravated battery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34. Defendant also appealed the trial court's judgment adjudicating him a third felony offender, and sentencing him to life imprisonment at hard labor, without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury, and was sentenced, for aggravated battery under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34. Following sentencing, plaintiff filed a multiple bill of information charging defendant with being a third felony offender. After a hearing, the trial court adjudicated defendant a third felony offender, and sentenced him to life imprisonment at hard labor, without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed. The appellate court affirmed defendant's aggravated battery conviction, because the victim's testimony alone was sufficient to establish the elements of the offense, and defendant's testimony was rife with internal contradictions and irreconcilable conflicts with the physical evidence. However, defendant's adjudication as a third felony offender and his sentence were vacated, notwithstanding the fact that plaintiff established that defendant had committed the prior offenses. Louisiana expanded the cleansing period in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 from 5 to 10 years, after defendant had committed those prior offenses, so to link those prior offenses with the current offense would constitute an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's aggravated battery conviction was affirmed. However, the trial court's adjudication of defendant as a third felony offender and his life sentence were vacated. Linking defendant's prior offenses with his current offense would constitute an ex post facto law, since the statutory cleansing period was expanded after those prior offenses had been committed. The case was remanded for defendant's resentencing as a second offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prison inmate appealed the dismissal of his petition by the Nineteenth Judicial District Court In and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, State of Louisiana, seeking review of an adverse decision pursuant to his Administrative Remedy Procedure, questioning the use of inmate counsel and the application of the Corrections Administrative Remedy Procedure Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:1171-1190, to his legal claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prison inmate sought to have the district court review claims related to appellant's failure to appeal his conviction and for other post-conviction relief. Appellant's proposed amendment and supplemental petitions did not remove the defects in the petition to which the exceptions were addressed, and as such the district court was not bound to allow the requested amendment. Allowing an offender to request review of more than one adverse decision in the same petition would unnecessarily complicate the reviewing court's role by having several records transmitted for review, and would not allow for orderly disposition of the suit. The assessment of a &quot;strike&quot; was in accordance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1187. That statute restricted the right of a prisoner to bring a civil action or an appeal when it was shown that on three or more prior occasions that prisoner's civil action or appeal had been dismissed as being frivolous, malicious, failing to state a cause of action, or failing to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The district court's dismissal of appellant's petition because it failed to state a cause of action was not in error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The district court was correct in assessing a &quot;strike&quot; against appellant prison inmate on the basis of the suit for filing more than three frivolous appeals. Bringing the motion seeking declaratory relief of an unrelated matter clearly constituted an abuse of process.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court manifestly erred in failing to consider as mitigating factors for appellant's failure to pay child support the domestic abuse appellant suffered from her subsequent husband and the attendant instability in her life, including unemployment and repeated relocation. The court held that the severance of all of appellant's ties with her daughters was not in the daughters' best interest. A strong bond existed between appellant and her daughters, appellant regularly visited them, and was not indifferent to their well-being. The benefits to the daughters of maintaining an ongoing relationship with appellant were not lessened by their strong relationship with appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed because the trial court erred by failing to consider mitigating factors of domestic abuse when determining whether appellant had just cause for failing to pay child support for one year, and because the adoption of appellant's two daughters by appellee was not in the daughters' best interests.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of armed robbery, adjudicated as a third felony offender, and was sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The trial court denied defendant's motion to reconsider the sentence, and defendant appealed. Defendant contended the State failed to produce sufficient evidence to support his conviction for armed robbery, the trial court erred when it concluded that the defendant was a third felony offender, and the sentence imposed by the trial court was unconstitutionally excessive. The court held the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt defendant was guilty of armed robbery, defendant was a third felony offender because the State proved the validity of the guilty pleas on the prior offenses, and defendant did not present any evidence that the sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1993, an individual diagnosed with the HIV virus sued defendant, a manufacturer of hemophilia clotting factor. By supplemental petition in 1994, he added three additional defendant-manufacturers. Upon his death, his parents supplemented themselves as plaintiffs. Following a jury verdict in favor of plaintiffs, defendants filed exceptions of prescription. Finding the suit time-barred, the trial court dismissed plaintiffs' claim. The court affirmed. Pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3492, prescription began to run when damage to the plaintiffs manifested itself with sufficient certainty to support accrual of a cause of action. The record clearly established that as of 1987, decedent strongly suspected his condition was caused by a blood transfusion he received in 1984. The court rejected plaintiffs' theory that subsequent exposures to the HIV virus constituted continuing torts. While La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1153 permitted relation back to the date of filing the original pleading, art. 1153 did not apply to a supplemental petition. Plaintiffs' suit was time-barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana) which convicted him of two counts of first degree robbery sentenced to five years on each count and adjudicated him a triple offender sentenced to life imprisonment without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant committed two separate robberies where he induced the store clerks to believe and fear that he was armed. Defendant was convicted him of two counts of first degree robbery and was adjudicated a triple offender. The multiple offender sentence was life imprisonment without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The court affirmed the robbery convictions. The court found there to be sufficient identification and induction of fear that defendant was armed with dangerous weapon and that the victim's belief was objectively reasonable under the circumstances. The photographic lineup was not unduly suggestive. The court vacated the multiple offender adjudication and sentence. It was not clear which count was being enhanced. The State argued that, because the instant convictions arose out of separate and distinct criminal episodes, the defendant could be properly sentenced as a multiple offender on both counts. However the multiple bill of information charged defendant with first degree robbery, not two counts of first degree robbery, as the offense to be enhanced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions of first degree robbery were affirmed. The testimony was sufficient to find that that the defendant induced a reasonable fear that he was armed. The triple offender adjudication and sentence were vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the court's opinion, because it was not clear which count was being enhanced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the 24h Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, State of Louisiana, denying defendant's motions for mistrial alleging that the prosecutor repeatedly engaged in misconduct, convicting him for distribution of cocaine, and sentencing him to 15 years' hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of distribution of cocaine. Defendant denied a 1996 theft conviction. Prosecutor did not question defendant further. Thus, defendant was not prejudiced by the question and a mistrial was not warranted. Prosecutor's questions regarding the actions of his trial attorney did not breach the attorney-client privilege and did not constitute prosecutorial misconduct warranting a mistrial. Thus, the motion for a mistrial on the basis of the prosecutor's questioning was properly denied. The officer testified that defendant summoned him around the corner and sold him two rocks of crack cocaine. The officer identified defendant in court and in a photographic line-up as the subject who sold him drugs. The jury chose to believe the State's witnesses rather than defendant's account of the events. Thus, the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of distributing cocaine. Defendant had previous convictions for attempted murder and armed robbery. Thus, defendant was not a first time felony offender and the sentence of 15 years' hard labor was not excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; officer identified defendant as the person who sold him two rocks of crack cocaine. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to convict him of distributing cocaine. Prosecutor's questions were not improper and did not warrant a mistrial. The sentence of 15 years' hard labor was not excessive because of defendant's prior convictions for attempted murder and armed robbery.</SPAN></P>
