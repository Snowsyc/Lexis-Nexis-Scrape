Laws, ch. 370, the law was unconstitutional because it placed an undue burden on a woman's access to abortion; it would cause the doctor's clinic to close, or he would risk criminal and civil penalties for failing to meet a hospital admission requirement, resulting in only one abortion provider in the state, leaving many women without services, violating the U.S. Constitution; [2]-S.B. 1848 violated the single-subject rule of Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect;57 because it contained multiple subjects that were not germane, relative and cognate to a common theme and purpose, and its sections were so unrelated and misleading that a legislator voting on the matter could have been left with an unpalatable all-or-nothing choice.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 172 (Supp. 2005) controlled the rights of the deceased claimants' lawyers to attorney's fees because the Legislature provided for the amount of attorney's fees to be paid in Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 172 in a specific statute stating the liabilities of the Multiple Injury Trust Fund, which controlled over the general statute; the orders awarded a 20% fee by directing payment of every 5th weekly check as an attorney's fee; and the amount of attorney's fees had vested at the time of the order and constituted private property within the meaning of the Due Process provision of the Oklahoma Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The campus disciplinary board found that a student was guilty of violating the student code for public drunkenness and other misconduct.

Stat. tit. 75, &sect; 250.4(B)(12) did not expressly provide for application of Article II of the Administrative Procedures Act when a student was subject to discipline less than expulsion; (2) an independent district court civil action was an adequate remedy for an alleged violation of a student's rights to due process in a disciplinary proceeding; (3) the possibility of a subsequent institutional offense that was subject to Article II for having an enhanced punishment did not require the former offenses to be also subject to Article II; and (4) constitutional arguments that were not adjudicated in the district court could be not adjudicated in a supervisory writ proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court assumed original jurisdiction, issued prohibition to prevent enforcement of the order denying summary judgment on the sole ground that the district court lacked appellate administrative jurisdiction, and directed the district court to dismiss the student's administrative appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found marijuana use was not the major cause of the worker's injury but the last sentence of Okla.

The supreme court held this was error because the statute created a rebuttable, not irrebuttable, presumption that his positive drug test made him ineligible for compensation. Viewing the sentence in isolation was error because it made the first three sentences of the paragraph superfluous and led to absurd results, as (1) the sentence had no time frame for a required test if not viewed in conjunction with the issue of major cause of the relevant accident, (2) there was no restriction on when eligibility would resume, and (3) the paragraph's first two sentences linked drug, chemical, or alcohol use as a major cause to the injury or accident, so, once a claimant tested positive or refused to test for a substance after an injury or accident, the claimant was allowed to overcome the presumption by showing substance use was not the &quot;major cause.&quot; The worker rebutted the presumption because the trial court found nothing showed the marijuana in his system was the &quot;major&quot; cause of an accidental injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant filed a claim of an injury to his right foot, which was sustained. He amended this to add his lower back as a cumulative trauma arising out of his original injury, which was denied. A three-judge panel affirmed the trial court's order. The COCA vacated the order of the three-judge panel, and the employer sought certiorari review. The employer argued that the COCA erred in applying the &quot;clear weight&quot; standard because the injury arose before the 2010 amendment to Okla.

The claim here accrued on December 24, 2008, the date of the claimant's last exposure. The denial of the award for the claimant's lower back was supported by competent evidence, neither party objected to the medical evidence presented, and the employer presented evidence from its medical expert that denied that the injury to either the lower back or the foot arose from the claimant's employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the school districts lacked standing to obtain declaratory relief on their claim that it was unconstitutional for public funds to be used for parents to send their disabled children to private schools under the Lindsey Nicole Henry Scholarship for Students with Disabilities Program Act. The funds at issue were not taxes from taxpayers in the districts' county revenue streams that a county assessor was improperly reducing or disposing of but were part of the Legislature's general grant to the districts, through the State Department of Education. Because the school districts were not the ones charged with the duty to provide free public education, the Legislature's withholding of certain funds, even if it was unconstitutional, did not violate a constitutionally protected interest of the school districts themselves, because they were merely the Legislature's vehicle. Nor did the school districts have taxpayer standing to challenge the expenditure of public funds because they were not taxpayers themselves.</SPAN></P>

On appeal by the employer, the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals vacated the awards, holding the court's finding the lift van was medically necessary was against the clear weight of the evidence. Claimant filed a petition for certiorari, which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant had suffered a low back injury in 2001. Her physician opined that she needed a scooter in order to go out comfortably, although she could walk and drive. The lift van was needed to transport the scooter. The Court of Civil Appeals had reversed the award of the lift van, applying the &quot;clear weight of the evidence&quot; standard of Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 3.6(C), that had been enacted in 2010. The court held that the proper standard was the standard in effect at the time of her 2001 injury. The court expressly rejected the legislature's attempt in Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 340 (2011), to require the new standard to apply regardless of when the injury occurred. Application of the new standard destroyed claimant's constitutionally protected substantive right under Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 52, to have her appeal considered under the former &quot;any competent evidence&quot; standard. Similarly, consideration of the law on the date of injury also determined the appropriate law to use for determining the amount of temporary total disability benefits. The application of the later-enacted version of Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 22, denied claimant continuing TTD benefits to which she was entitled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent electors argued that the purpose of the OCIA was to provide adequate and suitable space for offices and to improve and expand the State highway infrastructures and because the dam was neither a State office facility nor a highway improvement, the OCIA had exceeded its statutory authority. The owners argued that because the City of Tulsa owned the dam, improvements to it could not be assumed by the State without violating Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect;&sect; 14 and 15. The supreme court found that the State's involvement in the project existed only to lend its credit and to make a donation for the benefit of the municipality. If the State of Oklahoma, through the OCIA, was to hold title only long enough to borrow money and complete the improvements before transferring full ownership back to the municipality, then it would certainly appear that the bond issue was violating the spirit of &sect;&sect; 14 and 15.

Also, for purposes of summary judgment, there was sufficient evidence to create a factual dispute on the issue of ownership of the ring with stones. Both of the agency's motions for summary judgment and accompanying reports acknowledged that on December 6, 2004, the inmate had possession of a gold ring with stones. The inmate had consistently maintained his ownership of the gold ring in question. Photographs and other documents in the record indicated that in 1999 the inmate had previously possessed a gold ring matching the description of the same one seized by the employees in 2004.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was correct in concluding that the complex facilities were open to all regardless of ability to pay. Regardless of the source of the funding, the end result in the case furthered the complex's charitable purpose and relieved the State of Oklahoma of burdens it might otherwise have to bear. The record was clear that during the tax assessment years in question, the majority stockholder in the company which provided management services to the complex did not receive any private gain because no actual payment was made to the company during 2004, 2005, or 2006. The economic conditions of the property could not support the payment. Because the stockholder did not receive private gain during the tax assessment years in question, this factor did not preclude the complex from the claimed constitutional exemption. Because the complex demonstrated that its property was used exclusively for charitable purposes, Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2887(8)(a)(2)(b) (2004) was unconstitutional to the extent that it imposed stricter requirements for exemption from ad valorem taxation than those set by Okla.

Stat. tit. 62, &sect; 34.70(B)(5) (2011). The federal district court dismissed the claim, and the organization appealed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit certified two questions to the court under Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 1601, et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 62, &sect; 34.70(B)(5), allowed state employees to elect voluntary payroll deductions for various purposes. An amendment to the statute restricted voluntary payroll deductions for state employee membership organizations to organizations with at least 2,000 members. The plaintiff had only 1,900 members and therefore its members would not qualify for automatic payroll deductions, while a larger public service employees organization had more than 2,000 members. The question certified from the federal court was whether, if the federal court determined that the numerosity requirement conflicted with constitutional guarantees of free speech, the offending statutory provision could be severed pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 75, &sect; 11a (2011). The court answered that yes, the numerosity provision was severable. Several provisions of the statute allowed state employees to request voluntary payroll deductions without imposing any numerosity requirement; the altered statute would be capable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent to allow state employees to enjoy the convenience of payroll deductions.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court noted that the conflict between a city's and the State's taxing authority had long existed.

The city's constitutional and charter authority was not unconstitutionally infringed by Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2702(A) (Supp. 2010).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner chiropractors filed an application requesting that the Supreme Court of Oklahoma assume original jurisdiction and declare portions of Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect;&sect; 329 and 333, to be unconstitutional for the reason that they are special laws prohibited by Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 46.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Oklahoma Legislature enacted a new Workers' Compensation Code. Under Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 329, an independent medical examiner could only be a licensed medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy. Petitioner chiropractors challenged the constitutionality of the new code. On review, the court held that the legislature, by the exclusion of not only chiropractors, but also podiatrists, dentists, and optometrists, created a suspect special class. Because there was neither a distinctive characteristic upon which the different treatment was reasonably founded nor one that furnished a practical and real basis for discrimination between the groups within the classes, the distinction was arbitrary and without relation to the subject matter. Those portions of the statutes that excluded all physicians other than medical doctors or doctors of osteopathy, including the definition of &quot;qualified independent medical examiner&quot; in Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 308(39), were unconstitutional. Further, those provisions changing the standard of proof from the preponderance standard to the clear and convincing standard were unconstitutional because they violated the separation of powers clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Those portions of the law that limited the definition of &quot;qualified independent medical examiner&quot; to only a licensed medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy were special laws in violation of the Oklahoma Constitution. Further, portions of Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect;&sect; 326, 329 and 332 (Supp. 2011), violated the separation of powers clause, Okla. Stat. art. IV, &sect; 1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a divorce, the property owner brought a contempt proceeding against his ex-wife for her removal of fixtures from the marital home, which he had been awarded in the divorce decree. She was found guilty of contempt. Two years later, the property owner brought a replevin action in small claims court against his ex-wife and her daughter alleging that they wrongfully possessed some of his farm equipment. The trial court ruled that the claims were barred by the preclusive effect of the contempt proceeding and by the two-year statute of limitations in Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 95(A)(3) (2009). The court held that the informality of the Small Claims Procedures Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1751 et seq. (Supp. 2004), made it appropriate for the trial court to apply the pertinent statute of limitations to the evidence adduced at the small claims proceeding, even when the statute was not raised as an affirmative defense pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2008 (Supp. 2009). Given the latitude of discretionary power of a trial judge in a small claims action, it would be illogical to preclude the judge from applying the dispositive law simply because it was not raised.</SPAN></P>

Respondent's hearing originally scheduled for March 19, 2002, occurred on September 23, 24, 2002. During that delay of six months Respondent still possessed his license to practice law in Oklahoma, although he was residing in Arizona. During those six months Respondent and the Bar filed motions, conducted discovery, participated in pretrial proceedings, and Respondent brought an original jurisdiction proceeding relating to his disciplinary proceeding. Respondent's disciplinary case was not languishing from neglect on the Bar docket. All of the trial panel procedures, including notice and opportunity to appear, present a record, opportunity to testify, and file briefs, were provided to Respondent.

The remaining language in &sect; 9A provided a population appropriation formula for apportioning senate districts. A population apportionment formula necessarily required equality in the state's total population so that the forty-eight senate districts had only minimal deviation from the ideal district population determined by the most recent Federal Decennial Census.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer gave qui tam notice and demand to appellees, a city and its industrial authority, a public trust. The industrial authority sought a declaratory judgment that its participation in the development of a retail outlet was legal. The taxpayer filed a motion to intervene, which a trial court denied. The Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals dismissed the taxpayer's appeal. The taxpayer sought certiorari for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the taxpayer's appeal was not moot. The controversy involved a judicial declaration on contested public expenditures and a taxpayer alleging that the issues had not been fairly presented to the trial court and that justiciability was absent. It also involved the inadequacy of a public body to represent a taxpayer for purposes of intervention while opposing a taxpayer's claims on the merits. The qui tam statutes,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 62, &sect;&sect; 372 and 373, did not ordinarily apply to a public trust. Thus, no qui tam claim relief could be sought on behalf of the industrial authority. The taxpayer alleged unauthorized or unlawful expenditure of municipal taxes by a city and unlawful issuance of bonds by a public entity. The taxpayer had pled a claim seeking relief in equity that had been recognized by Oklahoma courts since before statehood. Thus, the trial court erroneously denied the taxpayer's motion to intervene on the claim seeking equitable relief. The combined filings of the industrial authority, the developer, and the city presented a justiciable controversy to the trial court as measured against the taxpayer's qui tam request for relief filed in that court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order to the extent it denied the taxpayer's motion to intervene as a qui tam plaintiff, but reversed the order to the extent it denied the taxpayer's motion to intervene as a taxpayer seeking equitable relief. The opinion of the court of civil appeals was vacated, and the matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged partial summary judgment granted by the District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma, arguing that the district court erred in finding that H.B. 1804, the Oklahoma Taxpayer and Citizens Protection Act of 2007, was unconstitutional only as to that portion of Section 13 that amended Okla. Stat. tit. 70, &sect; 3242A)(1) and (2) (Supp. 2006), to deny resident tuition for higher education to those who passed the GED test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that, while the district court properly concluded that a provision that denied resident tuition for higher education to people passing the GED test was unconstitutional, it erred in failing to recognize another unconstitutional provision of the Act. Specifically, Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 171.2(C) (Section 5(C) of H.B.1804), created a presumption of flight risk for a person whose citizenship status was that of a foreign national who had not been lawfully admitted to the United States. The law was a special law prohibited by the Okla. Const. art. 5 &sect; 46, proscription on the legislature's passing special laws regulating the practice or jurisdiction of, or changing the rule of evidence in judicial proceedings or inquiries before the courts. Whether a particular accused was a flight risk was a determiation to be made by the trial judge in that case. Therefore, the trial court's ruling insofar as it held that Okla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient filed suit against the surgeon after he performed arthroscopic knee surgery on the patient, alleging that she suffered nerve damage to her leg as a result of the surgeon's negligence. Her expert witness testified that there was nothing wrong with the movement or nerves in the patient's thigh before surgery, but there was femoral nerve damage after surgery. He thus opined that it was more probable than not that the injury developed during the surgical procedure but that he would require additional information to determine the cause with certainty. The surgeon moved for summary judgment, arguing that the patient failed to establish causation. On review, the court held summary judgment would be proper only if there was a complete lack of evidence and no reasonable inference tending to link the doctor's negligence to the patient's harm, and there was not an absence of proof that the surgeon's treatment proximately caused the patient's injuries. The neurologist was not required to establish causation with absolute certainty, and his conclusions were probative and supported by corroborating evidence that nothing was wrong with the patient's leg before surgery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient brought an action for medical malpractice against appellee medical providers for failure to diagnose and properly treat fractures in her left foot. The trial court granted summary judgment to the medical providers, finding that the action was barred by the statute of limitations, Okla. Stat. tit. 76, &sect; 18 (Supp. 2002). The Court of Civil Appeals, Oklahoma, affirmed. The patient was granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was injured in a car accident. Defendants argued that her claim was barred by &sect; 18 as she should have known of the existence of her injury once her fractured toes were discovered. The patient argued that it was not the broken toes but the delay in her diagnosis and defendants' treatment that caused her pain and caused her injury to result in a permanent disability. She alleged that she did not discover their negligence until she first visited another doctor. The court concluded that the lower courts erred in treating the date of the patient's claim as arising from the failure to x-ray her foot and using the date of the x-ray as the beginning of the limitation period. Although the x-ray revealed the fractures, it did not reveal that defendants' treatment of her fractures was wrongful. It could be argued that she had sufficient knowledge to seek other medical advice after defendants' failure to timely x-ray her foot but due diligence did not necessarily require her to abandon her doctor and seek a legal remedy. As this was a determination of fact, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the opinion of the appellate court and reversed the trial court's decision. The case was remanded to the trial court for the submission of the question of whether the patient exercised reasonable diligence in discovering the cause of the pain and disability that accompanied her treatment by defendants to the trier of fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of a decision of the Court of Civil Appeals (Oklahoma), which upheld a decision determining that appellees, who were paternal grandparents, were not seeking visitation pursuant to a grandparent-visitation statute and upheld their requested visitation. The grandparents had sought the visitation by filing a motion in the mother's underlying divorce proceeding with the grandparents' son.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents' motion for visitation made no allegation of harm or potential harm to the child. Their allegation was merely that it was in the best interests of the minor child that the child maintain a strong and healthy relationship with her paternal family. Their testimony was that they desired to continue the good relationship they had with their grandchild. Their post-trial brief pointed to no testimony relating to potential harm to the child in the absence of the court-ordered visitation. The mother's testimony that the grandparents could continue visitation, although in the mother's presence, was not denied by the grandparents. The trial court's order made no findings relating to harm or potential harm to the child. The court overruled the decision and held that a non-custodial non-parent third-party could not use the power of the State to compel a custodial parent to relinquish custody and control over that parent's child and obtain an order compelling visitation without satisfying that person's burden of showing harm or potential harm in the absence of such visitation and that a grandparent's rights to court-compelled visitation with a grandchild were statutory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Oklahoma Department of Mines (ODM), sought review of a decision entered by the District Court of Sequoyah County, Oklahoma, which entered a temporary injunction requested by plaintiff property owner to prevent an informal conference under Okla. Admin. Code 460:10-17-7 by the ODM to consider intervenor corporation's application for a mining permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was informed that he was not eligible to participate in the informal conference because he did not reside in, or own property within, one mile of the proposed mining site as required by Okla. Stat. tit. 45, &sect; 724(H)(2) (Supp. 2008) and Okla. Admin. Code 460:10-17-6(a). The owner brought the instant action for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the statute and administrative rule violated due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 7. On appeal, the court affirmed. While the ODM claimed that the owner could request administrative relief under Okla. Admin. Code 460:10-17-15 because the informal conference was not a final decision, the owner would be deprived of due process because he would not have the same ability to protect his property interest; by the time he would be permitted to be heard, opinions and evidence would already be part of the record. Being present at the conference without being permitted to participate was not a meaningful opportunity to be heard under the due process guarantees of the Oklahoma Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The city was not relying upon either the challenged executive sessions or the tainted agreements signed by the Mayor for legal support and justification of their expenditure of public funds or adoption of the challenged agreements. The supreme court held that the city has fairly presented taxpayer's claims on this ground and there were no facts or legal argument raised by taxpayer that were insufficiently presented by the city in its pleadings, motions, and accompanying materials.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was killed after he stopped on a bridge to investigate a minor accident. After it was determined that there was a compensable accident, the insurer paid workers' compensation death benefits on behalf of the decedent's employer. The insurer and the employer then sought to intervene in a wrongful death action, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 44(c), (d) (Supp. 2005). The trial court terminated the action as to all of the claims by the employer and the insurer. The court of appeals reversed, and further review was then sought. In vacating the court of appeals, the supreme court determined that &sect; 44(d) plainly and unambiguously granted to the employer, but not the insurer, an independent cause of action to recover from a third party tortfeasor the money paid out in death benefits under the Oklahoma Workers' Compensation Act. Nothing in &sect; 44(d) gave the insurer a right of recovery for death benefits that it had paid; therefore, the insurer had no standing. The insurer could not stand in the shoes of the employer, and the employer could not vicariously seek damages for losses it did not incur.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the employer's statute-of-limitations defense on the basis that Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 43(A) (Supp. 2005) unreasonably singled out employees who had been terminated and had sustained cumulative trauma injuries. The trial court found that the law was in direct conflict with the general two year statute of limitations for cumulative trauma injuries. The court agreed and held that the amendment in question brought &sect; 43(A) squarely within the special law prohibition of Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 46. The classification of injured employees on the basis of continued versus terminated employment was a false and deficient classification of the larger class of injured employees because it created preference for members in the continued employment group and resulted in unequal treatment for certain members of the terminated group that had no reasonable relationship to curtailing retaliatory claims or preventing stale claims. Thus, the action of the legislature was unreasonable in their creation of the statutory classification, and the 2005 amendment to &sect; 43(A) that added the six-month statutory limitations period was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon completion of a four year suspension, attorney sought reinstatement. The court previously denied reinstatement because the attorney had not paid the tax liability that led to suspension. The attorney moved for rehearing, asserting that the tax liability was discharged in bankruptcy and its nonpayment could not have been the basis to deny her application under 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 525(a). Rehearing was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court previously held that the discharge in bankruptcy could not have been treated as tantamount to having paid the debt. The court tied restoration of the attorney's fitness to practice law to the fulfillment of her moral obligation to pay the tax liability, notwithstanding its discharge in bankruptcy. However, upon rehearing, the court found that refusing to restore the attorney's license based on her nonpayment of the discharged tax liability was contrary to 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 525(a), and the United States Supreme Court's decision in Perez v. Campbell, 402 U.S. 637 (1971). Section 525(a) precluded any consideration of a debt discharged in bankruptcy in connection with the debtor's application for a government granted license. Suspended attorneys who obtained a bankruptcy discharge of the tax liability that led to their suspension were not excepted from the protection afforded by &sect; 525(a), and the existence of a state interest in perpetuating such liability was not a sufficient reason to deprive such attorneys of the full effectiveness of the federal law.</SPAN></P>

The city appealed, alleging the decision violated public policy under Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 26. The union moved to dismiss, contending the dispute was interest arbitration and not grievance arbitration. The court reversed, ruling &sect; 26 prohibited the union from using a formula agreed to in a previous year to obligate the city to a pay scale the succeeding year.

Defendants counterclaimed and filed third-party claims against third-party defendants, a loan trust and a business trust. The case was before the court upon the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit certifying two questions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city extended its water system to provide service to a development located within territory assigned to the water district. The questions were: (1) whether Okla. Const. art.

The court held that, while the plain language of the Oklahoma Rural Water Districts Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 82, &sect;&sect; 1324.1 through 1324.35 (2001 &amp; Supp. 2009), created a restricted franchise to serve the defined area, such franchise was not exclusive  of competition within a district's geographical boundaries. The court agreed with the Tenth Circuit's conclusion that &sect; 51 was not violated as no action by the Oklahoma Legislature had been taken that granted an exclusive right to a water district. Nothing in the Act prevented a municipality from exercising its governmental functions to regulate water services to an overlapping service area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified questions, holding that he Oklahoma Legislature did not grant an exclusive right under the Act. The Oklahoma Constitution was neither implicated, nor violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed a decision of the District Court of Ottawa County, Oklahoma, which found that defendant relocation trust had not violated the Open Meeting Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 25, &sect; 401-314, and that Okla. Stat. tit. 27A, &sect; 2205 (Supp. 2008) was an assertion of the State's sovereign immunity in the owners' action alleging that the trust had undervalued their property and had violated the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The geographic area at issue was a superfund site due to contamination, and a relocation assistance plan for residence was created under Okla.

While the court disagreed with the finding that the State invoked its sovereign immunity under &sect; 2205, the court affirmed as to the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 2203(M) and 2205. The court held that the owners had no constitutionally secured right under Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 6 for a remedy to be provided because the legislature explicitly refused to recognize a private cause of action. Unlike a case of eminent domain, the fact that the owners were unhappy with the trust's offer did not mean that the State was taking their property without due process in violation of Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 7. Also, because &sect; 2205 operated uniformly on the whole class, it was a general law under Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 46. However, the court reversed in part, concluding that the trust violated the Act by allowing persons not authorized under Okla. Stat. tit. 25, &sect; 307(D) to attend its executive sessions wherein the appraisal and purchase of real property were discussed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's judgment as to the constitutionality of the statutes at issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was the applicability of the one-subject rule pursuant to Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 57 to Okla. Senate Bill No. 1878, which was allegedly comprised of portions of five separate bills, involves multiple subjects concerning freedom of conscience. Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 57 stated, in part, that every act of the Legislature shall express but one subject. The court stated that it had held on numerous occasions that the one-subject rule applied to legislative acts promulgated through the initiative process, as well as those promulgated through the Legislature. The court further stated that it was growing weary of admonishing the Legislature for so flagrantly violating the terms of the Oklahoma Constitution. The Legislature ignored the court's earlier opinions, when it apparently consolidated five separate multi-subject bills into Okla. Senate Bill 1878 which facially, patently, and obviously contained multiple subjects. The court held that because Okla. Senate Bill No. 1878 was so obviously violative of the one-subject rule mandated by the terms of Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 57, it was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor had vetoed the legislative mandate within a House Bill for the Ethics Commission which required it to use a specified amount of its appropriation to purchase particular computer software, and he vetoed the legislative mandate within a Senate Bill for the Department of Corrections to budget specified amounts of its appropriation for delineated purposes. Petitioners contended that these bills were not appropriation bills subject to the Governor's veto authority as provided by Okla. Const. art. 6, &sect; 12. The court disagreed and held that nothing in the language of art. 6, &sect; 12 reflected that it was limited to bills that dealt exclusively with appropriations; rather, the language plainly indicated it applied to every bill making appropriations embracing distinct items. The Governor could use the line item veto provided in Okla. Const. art. 6, &sect; 12 in review of bills by the Legislature that added conditions or restrictions to previously appropriated funds, because such bills formed a part of the predicate appropriation for the payout of funds from the State treasury as provided in Okla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed an application asking the Supreme Court of Oklahoma to assume original jurisdiction and declare unconstitutional&nbsp;Okla.

The application was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenge was not to the reasonableness of the filing fees, but rather to the transfer of a portion of the filing fees in civil cases to three non-judicial programs, the Mutual Consent Voluntary Registry, Okla.

Stat. tit. 10A, &sect; 1-9-103 (2009), and the Office of the Attorney General Victim Services Unit, 2007 Okla. Sess. Laws ch. 156, &sect; 6. The court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 28, &sect; 152(D), (E), (F) and &sect; 152.1(B) (Supp. 2008) violated the state constitution's guarantee of access to the courts, Okla. Const., art. 2 &sect; 6. The funding of these programs through the use of fees imposed on litigants was impermissible. The legislature had imposed a fee or tax on those making use of the courts and had directed the court clerks to deposit those funds to the credit of these programs. The challenged statutes required the judicial branch of government to collect monies to be used to help fund social welfare programs operated by the executive branch of government. The courts could not operate as a tax collector for the executive branch of government, Okla. Const., art. 4 &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner challenged a ruling of the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals that affirmed a trial court ruling that it lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the formation of appellee, a state university board of regents, in an eminent domain proceeding instituted by the board of regents to take its real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of regents instituted an eminent domain proceeding to take real property. The landowner challenged the taking, arguing that the board of regents was unconstitutionally formed because Okla. Const. art. 6, &sect; 31A, required that the board be compromised of a majority of farmers. The trial court ruled that the landowner lacked standing to raise such an argument, and the appellate court affirmed. On review, the court held that the appellate court erred in concluding that the landowner could not attack the collateral order that rejected his constitutional challenge because an appellant was not precluded from reasserting errors after a final judgment was entered. Further, although the landowner had standing to challenge the taking of his property, such standing did not included a right to collaterally attack the qualifications of the board of regents; even if the landowner had such standing, however, the actions of the board of regents were valid because the regents were de facto regents who were approved by the state governor and confirmed by the state senate. Further, the actions were valid because the taking of the land for an athletic complex was for a valid public purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the appellate court was vacated, and the ruling of the trial court was affirmed. The case was remanded to the trial court for a jury trial on the issue of compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant brought an action for civil assault and battery against appellees following a fight. The District Court of Washington County (Oklahoma) sealed the documents referring to appellant and an eyewitness's polygraph test results, prohibited public dissemination of the information, and required that any future proffered evidentiary matters be pre-approved by the trial court as admissible evidence before filing. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees accused appellant of starting the fight by using racial slurs and threatening them with a knife. Appellant sought to introduce the results of a polygraph examination, which he claimed cleared him of those accusations, as reliable scientific evidence. One appellee's motion to seal all portions of the record which disclosed any of the information related to the polygraph examination or its results was granted. The court's order further prohibited evidentiary filings without its determination that the proffered filings were admissible evidence. This restriction was prior restraint under Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 22, and was unnecessary because the question of admissibility could have been addressed at any time before the evidence was presented to the trier of fact. The order sealing the record failed because no effort was made to show that the alleged threat to a fair trial by a public reference to polygraph evidence was anything more than a possibility, the order was overly broad to serve its intended purpose, and there were many less restrictive alternatives available to the trial court which would have served the same purpose with less severe restrictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the State for 16 years during which time he participated in the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System, Okla.

The employee notified the Board that he wished to transfer his 16 years of service to credit from the OPERS to the Board under &sect; 956.3. The Board denied his request claiming that &sect; 956.3 was unconstitutional. Upon review, the court determined that &sect; 956.3 applied equally to all employees whose retirement was under a &sect; 951 defined benefit plan. The challenged legislation created a reasonable classification and did not constitute a special law. Furthermore, the transfer of service credit under &sect; 956.3 did not constituted a taking of private property for public use under the constitutions of the U.S. and Oklahoma. Nor did the Board offer proof that the application of &sect; 956.3 would unconstitutionally impair the contractual obligations to its employees. The court found that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals affirmed. The company sought certiorari review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that the Legislature's authorization for the Commission to establish a plan and zoning regulations that had the force of law was an unconstitutional delegation of Legislative power to an entity whose members are all appointed. The supreme court found that review of Okla. Stat. tit. 73, &sect;&sect; 82.1 through 92 (2001 &amp; Supp. 2007) revealed that the Legislature did not expressly require that the plan and zoning regulations of the Commission be approved by the Legislature. Pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 73, &sect; 82.1 (2001), zoning of the district represented the will of the people of the State of Oklahoma and not merely local policy. In making and adopting an official master comprehensive plan and implementing regulations, including zoning regulations, as provided in Okla. Stat. tit. 73, &sect;&sect; 83.3 and 83.5 (2001), the Commission was engaged in &quot;rulemaking&quot; and the plan and regulations were &quot;rules&quot; governed by the Administrative Procedures Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 75, &sect; 250.3 (2001). The record was silent on whether the Commission had submitted its comprehensive plan and zoning regulations for Legislative review and approval. The trial court had to make that determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the district court was the proper forum for the taxpayer's action based on the court's prior decision in the United Airlines case that it was more appropriate for a district court to determine whether the Board had jurisdiction to assess a particular taxpayer and that Okla. Stat. art. 68, &sect; 2886 was applicable to such actions. The court held that Okla. Stat. art. 68, &sect; 2851.3 (Supp. 2002) was unconstitutional because it unreasonably required different methods of assessment for similarly situated gas gathering companies based on a company's status at an arbitrary past date. It was a special law in violation of Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 45 and art. 10, &sect; 14(A), and it violated Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant natural gas company sought review of a decision of appellee county tax assessor in the District Court, Woods County (Oklahoma). The district court held that the ad valorem property tax assessed against the gas company on gas held in storage underground in Woods County was unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 2. The assessor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gas company was headquartered in Missouri, sold no gas in Oklahoma, and maintained no facilities or employees in Oklahoma. However, the gas company stored natural gas in storage facilities in Oklahoma belonging to a pipeline company. The assessor concluded that the stored gas was subject to ad valorem taxation and assessed taxes based on the gas company's share of ownership of the gas in storage for 1998, 1999, and 2000. While agreeing that natural gas was tangible personal property, the gas company argued that the assessment was upon its interest in the gas, which was intangible personal property in the form of either an account receivable or a deposit, both of which were exempt from ad valorem taxation under Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 6A. The court held that the gas company's right to the pipeline company's services was not an account receivable; title to the gas remained at all times in the gas company. Nor was the gas a bailment or deposit. Because all the gas originated within Oklahoma, Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2831(E) (2001), did not apply. Further, the tax met all four prongs of the Brady test and was therefore valid under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court and upheld the assessor's original assessment of taxes against the gas company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner, who had many health issues, neglected to pay the ad valorem taxes on her home.

After leaving the hospital, the landowner found the notice and applied for an exemption from tax sale based on her disability and low income. The tax deed was recorded less than 60 days after the landowner claimed to have discovered the notice. The court stated that to the extent that Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 3106 (2001) implied that the failure to give actual notice to a record owner who was living on the property and whose whereabouts were known did not affect the validity of a tax sale, it conflicted with constitutionally protected due process notice requirements. The tax deed was void because it was issued before the 60-day redemption period under Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 3118 (Supp. 2002) had expired. In addition, the landowner showed that she was entitled to a disability exemption under Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect;&sect; 3105 (Supp. 2002), 3113 (2001).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that 2008 Okla. Sess. Laws ch. 395, &sect; 1 was constitutional. Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 217(G) (Supp. 2007)'s characterization of penalties and interest being a part of the tax could not take on constitutional proportion that would prohibit subsequent legislation from granting amnesty to delinquent taxpayers with regards to penalties and interest. As it stood, the legislature had simply created a temporary suspension of collection of penalty and interest as a tool for recovery of delinquent taxes. There was no constitutional limitation on the power of the legislature to direct the refund of penalties on delinquent taxes. No substantial difference existed between ordering a refund of penalties and waiving the payment of penalties as an incentive to encourage delinquent taxpayers to voluntarily pay the overdue taxes within a certain time. Courts would interfere and declare an act invalid and void only where the act of the legislature was clearly, palpably, and plainly inconsistent with the terms and provisions of the constitution. The court was not persuaded that the taxpayer had presented any authority that satisfied such a requirement.</SPAN></P>

Absent a record to the contrary, the lower court was duty-bond to indulge in a presumption of correctness that attached to the trial court's dismissal of the refilled action for want of timely service of process. To overcome the dismissal's presumptive correctness the daughters had to sustain the burden to show good cause for its delay in securing timely service. The daughters failed to meet that burden. They relied solely upon non-probative material consisting of unsworn conclusory references in a nisi prius brief which utterly lacked explanatory content of probative character.

Stat. tit. 85, &sect;&sect; 5-7, the District Court in Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) denied his motion for partial summary judgment and granted the employer summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer was entitled to summary judgment because the material facts that support the employer's defense were undisputed and supported but a single inference that the employer followed all policies in discharging the employee. Okla. Stat. tit. 74, &sect; 840-2.21(D), which provided that the right to return expired one year after the start of leave without pay, controlled over such more general statutes as Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 5, which prohibited discharge of any employee during a period of temporary total disability. Moreover, &sect; 840-2.21(D) was not a discriminatory or special law prohibited by Okla. Const., art. V, &sect; 46 or Okla. Const., art. V, &sect; 59. The employee did not argue that state employees who had a work-related illness or injury constituted an unreasonable legislative classification or that state employees had no distinctive characteristic upon which different treatment might be reasonably founded. Finally, &sect; 840-2.21(D) did not restrict access to the courts in violation of Okla. Const., art.

Stat. tit. 11 &sect; 38-101 et seq. (2001), and denied the landowner's exceptions to the commissioners' report. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city complied with the due process requirements in providing publication notice of meetings at which blight determinations were made given judicial precedent recognizing that such determinations were legislative rather than adjudicatory proceedings and that due process protections did not apply in legislative proceedings. There were also no requirements in either the Local Development Act or the Urban Renewal Act for personal notice of blight proceedings. Moreover, the landowner had an opportunity to enjoy the full range of due process protections in the condemnation proceedings. The city had substantially complied with the requirements of Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 38-106(B) (2001) where the blight determinations were made before the urban renewal plan was adopted, and the city had renewed its attempt to condemn the property at issue after the plan's adoption.

Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2817(I) (Supp. 2004) violated the fair cash value standard of Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 8(A)(2). The supreme court found nothing in Oklahoma jurisprudence since a prior case suggested that fair cash value meant anything other than fair market value qualified by the element of use. The Legislature, in the provisions of &sect; 2817(I), had implicitly created a separate use category for platted lots and determined that their fair market value was best measured by looking to the value of the underlying tract. This the Legislature was constitutionally empowered to do. What it may not do and what it had done with the statute was to potentially divorce the valuation of platted lots from the fair market value of the underlying tract of land as of the relevant assessment date. It arrested the process of annual reassessment required by law. The platted lot valuation provision of &sect; 2817(I) was severable from the remainder of the statute. The supreme court's decision invalidating the valuation formula contained in &sect; 2817(I) would operate prospectively to property valuations made after the date the opinion became final.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer sought an extraordinary writ to restrain respondent State Finance Director and State Treasurer from transferring, allocating, or paying out any state money pursuant to H.B. 1105, 2007 Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">H.B. 1105, 2007 Okla. Sess. Laws ch. 204, did not violate Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 23(4), as it did not make appropriations from the constitutional reserve fund. Rather, it directed the transfer of surplus funds which accrued to the general revenue fund, over and above that placed in the constitutional reserve fund. Moreover, H.B. 1105 dealt with actual revenues, not estimated revenues. H.B. 1105 was also consistent with the provisions to make an appropriation by law in Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 55, even though reference to other statutes was necessary to determine the objects or purposes of some of the appropriations. H.B. 1005 distinctly specified the amount appropriated to each agency or revolving fund. However, H.B. 1105 violated Okla. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, claimant and coalition (the coalition), sought a declaratory judgment that appellees, City of Jenks, City of Bixby (the cities) and association, were without authority to grant appellee company the right to build a toll bridge outside of the cities' corporate limits, and an injunction against the construction. The District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma, granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, and the coalition appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cities formed the association, a public trust, and entered into an agreement that granted the right to the company to construct, maintain, and operate a toll bridge over a river between the cities. Appellees argued that the agreement to build, maintain, and operate a toll bridge did not constitute a franchise because the association was not a municipality, and possessed specific statutory authority to carry out such a project. The coalition argued that the association had no authority outside the corporate boundaries of the cities under Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1370.7 (Supp. 2006), and the association could not authorize the construction of a toll road under Okla. Stat. tit. 69, &sect; 3006 (2001) and Okla. Stat. tit. 69, &sect; 3016 (2001). The appellate court agreed with the coalition. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment, because the north connection of the bridge did not connect streets or roadways within the City of Jenks. The Oklahoma Legislature intended that the municipalities, towns, or counties that formed the public trusts or transportation authorities be the ones in which the toll road or bridge was to be constructed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of summary judgment was reversed and remanded with directions to grant summary judgment in favor of the coalition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a custody case, the guardian ad litem's recommendation was against the father. However, she was not called to testify under Okla. Stat. tit. 43, &sect; 107.3(A)(2)(e). The father responded with writ applications. In granting relief, the supreme court determined that the right of trial involved the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. The father's fundamental due process rights were protected by the Oklahoma Constitution. Due process necessitated that a parent have the right to cross-examine the guardian ad litem once the guardian's report was proffered to the district court. To the extent that &sect; 107.3(A)(2)(e), which barred discovery of the guardian ad litem, negated the right of a parent to cross-examine the guardian concerning the contents of the report and the basis for a custody recommendation, it was an unconstitutional restraint on the parent's fundamental rights to the care, custody, companionship, and management of his or her child. The district court's order barring the father from calling the guardian ad litem from testifying in the cause suffered from the same constitutional infirmity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Included with the certification materials were two orders issued by the Tenth Circuit. The first indicated that the Tenth Circuit was considering summary dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The second reserved the jurisdictional issue for decision by the panel assigned the cause. The court ruled that because a decision by the Tenth Circuit to deny jurisdiction would render the court's opinion advisory, the court declined to answer the questions certified. It was apparent from the materials accompanying the certification that the Tenth Circuit could refuse to exercise jurisdiction over the appeal, which would leave any decision issued by the court subject to being rendered a prohibited advisory opinion. The certification put the court in the position of answering questions which could not be determinative of any issue in the cause. The Tenth Circuit must determine its jurisdiction to exercise its adjudicatory power. If the Tenth Circuit determined that it would not hear the appeal, the answers proffered would be given in the abstract. Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 1602 (2001), does not extend to the exercise of such judicial authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow's deceased husband worked for a city for many years. After his retirement, he received a monthly disability benefit under a pension plan adopted in Frederick, Okla., Ordinance 364, &sect;&nbsp;1. The widow sought continuation of this benefit after the husband died. The trustees filed a declaratory judgment action, which alleged that she was not entitled to such. Summary judgment was entered in their favor in the trial court, but the COCA reversed and remanded the case. In vacating the COCA, the supreme court determined that the ordinance in question did not obviously or clearly show what the legislative intent was concerning eligibility requirements for a surviving spouse to be entitled to a continuation of a disability benefit being received by a former employee at the time of their death. It would have been improper for the supreme court to hold that the widow was entitled to the surviving spouse pension merely because she was not legally separated from her husband or to create other eligibility requirements from a review and construction of the plan as a whole. The supreme court was unable to add, modify, or delete terms from the legislative municipal scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent claimant filed for workers' compensation benefits for an injury to her right knee. Petitioners, the employer and its insurer, contended at hearing that the court was required by Okla. Stat. tit. 95, &sect; 17(A) (2005) to give deference to the treating physician's opinion as to a rating. The workers' compensation court ruled that the statute was contrary to the state constitution. Petitioners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no constitutional infirmity in the statutory language creating a rebuttable presumption in favor of treating physicians' opinions in Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 17(A)(2)(a) (2005). The court did, however, agree with the claimant that the language in &sect; 17(A)(2)(b) restricting the workers' compensation court's determination of impairment and disability within the range of opinions of the treating physician and the independent medical examiner was constitutionally infirm and had to be stricken. Those restrictions on the workers' compensation court gave determinative effect to the opinions of the court-appointed independent medical examiner and the treating physician even when the treating physician's opinion was not supported by objective medical evidence. Such restrictions attempted to predetermine the range of the adjudicative facts and impermissibly invaded the judiciary's exclusive constitutional prerogative of fact-finding. It was the court's view that the purposes of &sect; 17 would not be significantly altered by severing the offending language, and the nonoffending language could stand alone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part and affirmed in part the order of the workers' compensation court. The language &quot;within the range of opinions of the treating physician and the Independent Medical Examiner&quot; in &sect; 17(A)(2)(b) was unconstitutional and severed from the statute. The language of &sect; 17(A)(2)(a) was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the Commission erred in treating its proceeding as legislative rather than judicial and whether its order was sustained by law and by substantial evidence. The Commission's order did not alter any of the ILEC's existing intrastate retail rates or affect any of its wholesale services or rates. On review, the court held that, under Okla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 20, that the potential for economic harm that resulted from a diminution in regulatory oversight by the Commission over the ILEC conferred on the intervenors standing to press for relief from the Commission's order. The court reviewed de novo the Commission's decision to treat its proceeding as legislative rather than judicial because a constitutional due process question was implicated and held that the hearing process exhibited the characteristics of a judicial proceeding rather than a legislative proceeding because it was similar, although not identical, to a rate hearing. Under a deferential standard of review, the court found that substantial evidence supported the Commission's findings that the public interest was served by reclassifying all but three of the ILEC's services as competitive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Native American tribe sued defendant state administrator and adoption agency, seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent the administrator from approving adoption materials under the Oklahoma Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 571 et seq. (2001). The District Court of Rogers County (Oklahoma) held, inter alia, that the tribe was entitled to notice of adoption proceedings. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Oklahoma Indian Child Welfare Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 40 et seq. (2001), did not conflict with the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1901 et seq., in its requirements of notice to the tribe under Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 40.4 (Supp. 2006) when voluntary or involuntary child custody proceedings were initiated, or under Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 40.6 (2001). The state Act supported the federal Act by recognizing that the tribe's interests had to be protected in adoption proceedings involving Indian children. The state Act was thus consistent with the federal Act and its purposes. The trial court correctly stated that the federal Act and the state Act applied to the adoption proceeding, the tribe was entitled to notice, and the placement preferences under 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1915 and Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 40.6 (2001) applied to voluntary and involuntary child custody proceedings. The trial court also properly declared that the administrator had a duty to see that there was compliance with the placement preferences of the prior to approving the adoption under the Oklahoma Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 571 et seq. (2001).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee mother had objected to appellant father's proposed move of their two children to New York.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the trial court misapplied the statutory burden of proof set forth in Okla. Stat. tit. 43, &sect; 112.3 (Supp. 2002). The appellate court agreed. The statute plainly and unambiguously placed the burden on the relocating parent to show that the move was proposed in good faith. Once that burden was met, as it was in this case, the statute shifted the burden of proof to the opposing party to show that the proposed move was not in the best interest of the children. The trial court's imposition of the added burden on the father was error. The appellate court declined to address the constitutionality of the statute and its alleged failures to follow case law, to be in harmony with Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 19 (2001), and to defer to a custodial's parent's prerogative to make child-rearing decisions without state interference. The mother's request for legal fees was denied as the record supported no overriding or compelling equitable considerations in favor of either party.</SPAN></P>

At issue was whether the petition violated Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect;&sect; 1, 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city changed the zoning of real property to allow a hospital and medical campus. Subsequently, the petitioners delivered the petition to the city clerk for verification and placement on the ballot, but the clerk refused to do so after the city attorney determined that the petition was legally insufficient. The trial court then denied the petitioners' application for the writ. The parties agreed that the number of signatures and filing dates met statutory requirements. However, the state supreme court affirmed the denial, finding that the petition was legally insufficient as it sought to unconstitutionally bind the city from exercising its legislative power to rezone. The city council derived its power to legislate from Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect;&nbsp;10-106 (2001), and that power was subject to limitations. Because an initiative was subject to the same limitations as other statutes, and a statute, pursuant to Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect;&nbsp;7, could be amended or repealed by a legislative body at will, than the petition could not preclude the city council from rezoning the property for 10 years. Moreover, the 10-year prohibition was not severable because it was fundamental to the petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state taxpayer sued respondents, the state Contingency Review Board (CRB), the governor, the state speaker of the house, and the president pro tempore of the state senate, seeking a declaration that the CRB's approval of expenditures to be made out of the Oklahoma Opportunity Fund pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 62, &sect;&nbsp;48 (Supp. 2006) usurped the power of the executive and was void ab initio. He sought injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues were: (1) whether the mandatory participation by the legislative members of the CRB in the approval of expenditures from appropriations to the Fund was an intrusion on the executive branch's powers in violation of Okla. Const. art. 4, &sect; 1, and, if so, (2) whether the offending portions of Okla. Stat. tit. 62, &sect; 48 (Supp. 2006) were severable, and, (3) whether the CRB's approval of funding for two projects was void ab initio. The state supreme court answered the first two questions in the affirmative and the third in the negative. It found that the taxpayer had standing to challenge the legislature's usurpation of the executive branch's power over the expenditure of enacted appropriations to the Fund; also, it found appropriate its assumption of original jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief as the case tendered a matter of public interest and there was a need for an early decision. The legislature could not participate in the administration of funds appropriated through enacted legislation, and CRB participation in the approval process was improper. But the constitutionally infirm provisions of &sect; 48 were severable, and the rest of the statute could stand alone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court invalidated those provisions of &sect;&nbsp;48 that required the CRB's approval of all expenditures from the Opportunity Fund. Its opinion was ordered to operate prospectively only.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient filed suit against appellee doctor in the District Court of Okmulgee County (Oklahoma) alleging that the doctor's utilization of the wrong medical device in her knee-replacement procedure was malpractice. The patient did not attach an affidavit to the petition attesting that a qualified expert had been consulted and issued an opinion sufficient to deem the claim meritorious as required by Okla.

</DIV>

The trial court disagreed and dismissed the cause. The patient appealed. The dispositive issue was whether the affidavit of merit requirement of &sect; 1-1708.1E was constitutional. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma held that the statute was an unconstitutional special law prohibited by Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 46 and that the requirement that a medical malpractice claimant obtain a professional's opinion that the cause was meritorious, at a cost of between $ 500 and $ 5,000, created an unconstitutional monetary barrier to court access guaranteed by Okla. Const. art.&nbsp;2, &sect; 6. No negligence claim, other than medical malpractice, was affected by the statutory affidavit requirement. By mandating uniformity of procedure, the terms of Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant began building a dam on his property without first applying for a water appropriation permit or otherwise seeking approval of the Oklahoma Water Resources Board (OWRB). The trial court granted plaintiffs a temporary injunction until defendant obtained an OWRB permit to construct the dam. The intermediate appellate court determined that Okla. Stat. tit. 82, &sect;&sect; 105.1 and 105.1A were unconstitutional, but nonetheless affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that remand was necessary to remedy procedural deficiencies in the proceedings below. It was error for the trial court to determine the riparian or appropriative rights of the parties to use stream water without first assuring that the state's interests were protected. The Legislature clearly intended for the OWRB to be notified of suits involving use of stream water, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 82, &sect; 105.5, so that the OWRB could in turn, notify the Attorney General of the lawsuit so that he could intervene to protect public interests. Because of the flawed procedure, the court did not address whether or not the statutes at issue were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimants sought review of orders of the Workers' Compensation Court (Oklahoma) denying a motion to certify their judgment to the district court and finding that any claimant who commenced an action against respondent Multiple Injury Trust Fund (MITF) before January 29, 1997, for a material increase had opted out of the class under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2023(C)(2) (2001) by commencing an individual action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants had filed a request for payment of interest on unpaid workers' compensation awards from the MITF. On appeal, the court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 42 (2001) exempted the MITF from certification of awards against it and that the instant case fit within the exception to the settled-law-of-the-case doctrine. The court further held that &sect; 42 was constitutional because the legislature could distinguish between the laws regulating workers' compensation insurers and those regulating the MITF, as the MITF had a continuing problem with the timely payment of awards due to lack of funds. However, the workers' compensation court erred by finding that, for purposes of a claimant opting-out of the class, the relevant fact was the commencing of an action for a material increase rather than commencing an action for interest on judgments against the MITF under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2023(C)(2)(c) (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the claimants' motion to certify their judgment to the district court was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, Oklahoma consumer loan lenders and a non-resident parent company and holding company, challenged a judgment of the District Court of Tulsa Oklahoma that was entered in favor of plaintiff borrower's guardian in his action alleging fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and awarded the borrower actual and punitive damages, sanctions and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident defendants challenged the constitutionality of Okla. Stat. tit. 23, &sect; 9.1 (Supp. 2002) pertaining to punitive damages and the non-resident defendants contest the district court's exercise of in personam jurisdiction. On appeal, the court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 23, &sect; 9.1 (Supp. 2002) did not violate defendants' due process rights and was facially constitutional, but that the amount awarded did not comply with &sect; 9.1 and was excessive based on the evidence presented. The court found that the trial court only instructed the jury on 2 options for punitive damages under &sect; 9.1 and did not follow the uniform instruction that provided 3 options. The court found that the trial court erred in exercising jurisdiction over the holding company because there was no evidence that it had the required minimum contacts in Oklahoma. However, the court found that the parent company had continuous contacts and the jury was properly instructed on the alter-ego theory.  The court found that the trial court erred in awarding the borrower costs under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 3237(C) and failed to follow proper procedures in sanctioning the parent company under Okla. Stat. tit. 23, &sect; 103.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the orders and judgments against the nonresident holding company and instructed the trial court to dismiss the holding company as a party. The court remanded the punitive damage award and the order imposing sanctions and awarding costs for further proceedings due to the trial court's error. The court declined to award appeal-related sanctions on the nonresident parent company and denied the motion to strike the sanction motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proponent filed an initiative petition; one section dealt with eminent domain issues. A second section would have rendered inefficacious any zoning law that fell outside certain exceptions. The protestants filed their objections to the proposed initiative. In finding the initiative was unconstitutional under Okla. Const. art. 5, 57, the court determined that the proposed initiative dealt with both a limitation on the power of eminent domain and the compensation owed when property values were adversely affected by zoning laws. The single subject rule applied to legislative acts promulgated through the initiative process, and its purpose was to prevent voters from being forced to choose between two unrelated provisions contained in one measure. Zoning laws and takings were mutually exclusive. The proper inquiry regarding the issue of germaneness was not how related to two items were, but instead whether it appeared that the proposal was misleading or that the provisions in such were so unrelated that those voting would have been faced with an all-or-nothing choice. As such, the proposed initiative was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners sought to sell water from a groundwater basin underlying their property to municipalities outside of the basin area. The basin, which was the only basin in the state that fell within the definition of a sensitive sole source groundwater basin, was the principal source of drinking water for municipalities within the basin area. The challenged legislation imposed a moratorium on issuing permits that would lead to public use of water from a sensitive sole source groundwater basin at locations outside of the basin area. On appeal, the court held that the challenged legislation was a valid general law under Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 59 because the legislation was of a general nature, the classification of sole source groundwater basins was rationally related to the purpose of conserving safe drinking water for in-basin use, and the legislation operated uniformly throughout the state on all major groundwater basins designated, presently and in the future, as sole source aquifers. The court determined that the challenged legislation did not result in a taking under U.S. Const. amend. V or Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 24 and did not deny equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The oil company sought to enjoin the builder from constructing a home on a lot near its oil well, arguing that the builder violated Okla.

The trial court granted summary judgment for the builder. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court judgment. The court held that the Oklahoma Legislature enacted the OSDA to provide a mechanism to balance the conflicting interests of the mineral interest owner and the surface owner. The court found that the builder was not the &quot;surface owner&quot; of the land on which the well sat and therefore the Surface Damages Act did not apply to his land. The court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 52, &sect; 318.10 was part of the OSDA, therefore as a matter of law, &sect; 318.10 did not apply to the builder as an adjacent landowner even if the house was constructed within 125 feet of the wellbore.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county petitioned for writ of certiorari to the Court of Civil Appeals (Oklahoma), which reversed the district court's order confirming the county's takings of defendant landowners' property under Okla. Stat. tit. 27, &sect; 5 (2001) for right-of-way easements for placement of three water pipelines, two of which would solely service a private electric generation plant (company) proposed for construction and operation in the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company proposed to build the third water pipeline on behalf of a water district, and this pipeline was intended to serve residents of the water district. The appellate court found that the takings were unlawful in that they were for the direct benefit of a private company and not for &quot;public purposes&quot; as required under &sect; 5. The court adhered to the rule of strict statutory construction of eminent domain statutes and construed &quot;public purpose&quot; narrowly. Economic development alone did not constitute a public purpose and therefore, did not constitutionally justify the county's exercise of eminent domain. Furthermore, the Oklahoma state constitutional eminent domain provisions placed more stringent limitation on governmental eminent domain power than the limitations imposed by the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The proposed purpose of economic development, clearly did not fall within any of express exceptions of Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 23 to the general rule against the taking of private property for private use. Finally, Okla. Stat. tit. 66, &sect; 55(D) (2001) applied to permit reimbursement to the prevailing landowners for their reasonable appeal-related attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a municipal employees relation board and union, appealed the ruling by the District Court in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, that granted plaintiff city's summary judgment motion that held that Oklahoma Municipal Employee Collective Bargaining Act (Act), Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 51-200 et seq. (Supp. 2005), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union had requested certification from the relations board to represent the city's employees when the Act became effective. The basis for the grant of the city's summary judgment motion was the trial court's determination that the Act's classification of municipalities with populations greater than 35,000 for collective bargaining purposes was arbitrary and thus constituted a special law in violation of Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect;&sect; 46 and 59. The state supreme court reversed the grant of summary judgment and held the Act was not a special law in that it applied equally to those municipalities with populations over 35,000 and the application of the law to those municipalities bore a reasonable relationship to the goal of granting employees of larger municipalities an intermediary to speak to the upper management of the municipality on their behalf. The appellate court also held that the Act did not violate Okla. Const. art. 18, &sect;&nbsp;3(a) because the promotion of orderly and constructive collective bargaining between municipal employers and their employees was a matter of public policy. Thus, the Act did not violate the home rule doctrine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals reversed the district court's granting of summary judgment in favor of the State on its forfeiture action against currency in appellant claimant's possession which was found in close proximity to controlled dangerous substances. The State petitioned for certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the Court of Civil Appeals erred in declaring that the claimant's two separate claims to money seized in the first and second arrests should have been consolidated for adjudication in this single case. The supreme court determined that there was no showing of some predominant equitable consideration that demanded a joint trial of the two separate claims to money which arose out of discrete events. Error in the trial court's refusal to adjudicate a claim arising from the earlier arrest had not been shown. The supreme court corrected the style and sequence of the parties in the caption on appeal to conform to Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 3002 (2001). The State's evidentiary material established prima facie the requisite statutory connection, the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act (Act), Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-501 et seq. (2001), that provided support for forfeiture. The quantum of the seized forfeitable substances found in close proximity to the money was amply sufficient proof to shift to the claimant the burden to show by counter-affidavit circumstances sufficient to raise a disputed issue of fact, which the claimant did not do.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In adjudicating appellant mother's four minor children as deprived, the trial court admitted testimony by a therapist repeating statements made by one of the children. Inter alia, the Court of Civil Appeals, Division II (Oklahoma), held that the testimony did not qualify for the &quot;medical diagnosis or treatment&quot; exception to the hearsay rule, Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 2803(4) (2005), and reversed. Appellee State filed a petition for certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child said that he got home from school, that the boyfriend was still in the house, and that he left the apartment to go to a neighbor's home to call the police, then went back to the apartment and was locked out. The therapist also testified that the child reported that the boyfriend had hit him before and that the child had not varied his story until their therapy sessions ended about one month later. There was no question that the testimony was hearsay but the referee admitted the testimony under the exception to the hearsay rule allowing the admission of statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment under &sect; 2803(4). The referee concluded that the therapist was qualified as a medical professional for purposes of the exception. The nature of the child's allegations were already in the record through other testimony. There was no reason to believe that the referee had placed an undue emphasis on the statements of a young boy in unquestionably difficult circumstances. The unique circumstances of the case at bar led the supreme court to conclude that the admission of the therapist's testimony was not a clear abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 70, &sect; 4019 (Supp. 2004). Protestant taxpayers opposed the application. The taxpayers contended that &sect; 4019 violated the provisions of the Oklahoma Constitution generally prohibiting debt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed bonds were authorized by the legislature to increase the state's contributions to the Oklahoma State Regents' Endowment Trust Fund. The court decided that the bonds could not become debts of the state because the legislature could not dictate how the Regents allocated their annual appropriation. If the legislature could not dictate how the Regents allocated their appropriation, there was no legal or practical basis for compelling a future legislature to appropriate tax money to retire the bonds. The court concluded, therefore, that the proposed bonds would never become a state debt and thus did not violate Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect;&sect; 23 - 25. The court also rejected the taxpayers' argument that neither the Authority nor the Regents were authorized to issue bonds for wages and salaries.  Okla. Stat. tit. 70, &sect; 4019 (Supp. 2004), did not conflict with the Regents' other duties and authority. Section 4019 authorized the Regents to enter into agreements with the Authority to issue the proposed bonds for the Trust Fund, a power that only enhanced the Regents' ability to fulfill their duty as trustees.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 28, &sect; 152.1(A)(7) (Supp. 2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment barring the clerk from collecting the jury fee in future causes, claiming that it violated Okla. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 6 and 19. The court affirmed noting that almost uniformly, courts faced with the issue have upheld the jury fee collections and therefore the collection of jury fees, as a prerequisite to accepting the first motion to enter for filing and docketing in a pending action, was constitutional under art. II, &sect;&sect; 6 and 19. As to the amount the fee, the court noted that studies indicated that the failure to impose substantial fees systematically resulted in the overuse of jury dockets. Clearly, the fee of $ 349.00, required as a prerequisite for calling a jury, could not be considered excessive when compared with the average length trial at estimated costs of $ 480.00 for a six-person jury trial or $ 840.00 for a twelve-person jury trial. The imposition of such a fee was not a denial or sale of justice within the meaning of art. II, &sect; 6, where, as here, they were uniform, reasonable, and related to the services provided. Furthermore, it would be unreasonable to require the return of jury fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff country club filed a declaratory judgment action in the District Court in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, against defendant town.

The country club appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the district court, the country club asserted that Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 21-109(A) (2001) exempted it from collecting, reporting, and remitting the town's sales tax. The issue of first impression presented on appeal was whether the country club was exempt from the duties to collect, report, and remit municipal sales tax by the statute's language. The statute provided that tracts of land in excess of 40 acres annexed to a municipality and used for commercial purposes were subject to municipal taxes. The statute's language was unambiguous, and the legislative intent behind the statute was clear. The supreme court noted that in the statute's first sentence, the phrase &quot;shall not be subject to municipal taxes,&quot; applied to tracts of land in excess of 40 acres, which meant that such tracts of land could not be subject to municipal property taxes. The statute did not shield a vendor from the obligations created by a municipal sales tax. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the town.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city contended that the Act was unconstitutional because it only applied to certain cities. After summary judgment was granted in favor of the city, an appeal was filed. In affirming, the court held that the Act granted the privilege of collective bargaining to eligible employees of municipalities with populations greater than 35,000. It did not apply to all cities in the state; therefore, it was a special law. The Act was subject to the provisions of the Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 46 prohibiting special laws regulating the affairs of cities. The language &quot;with a population greater than thirty-five thousand persons&quot; in the definition of &quot;municipal employer&quot; in Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 51-202(12) (2004) offended Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 46. The constitutionally-offensive language was an integral part of the Act, so severance was not an option.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant Oklahoma Capitol Improvement Authority resolved to issue state facilities revenue bonds pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 73, &sect; 306 (Supp. 2004). The Authority filed an application with the court, seeking approval of the proposed bond. The Authority asserted that the Legislature authorized issuance of the bonds to pay for a state capitol dome project. Three protestants challenged the Authority's application for approval of the bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Authority stated that the bonds, when issued, would constitute a self-liquidating obligation, that they would not create a debt prohibited under Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect;&sect; 23, 24 and 25, and that the proceeds were dedicated to a specific public purpose. Protestants raised the issue of the constitutionality of the financing plan. The court concluded that protestants advanced no legally or factually supportable reasons to disapprove the application. The court first noted that it would not overrule prior case law, which had expressly approved using lease payments by state agencies to repay bonds financing a state building, which payments were made over a number of years. The court next stated that it did not have to consider propositions of error unsupported by convincing argument or authority, and it thus rejected prostestants' arguments regarding a state commission's authority for any of the bond transactions. Finally, the court determined that the fact that the dome project served a public purpose could not be questioned. Public benefits flowing to the State were sufficient to satisfy constitutional provisions that prohibited benefiting private corporations.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the parental coordinator was there to aid in the communication between the natural parent and that the appointment did not involve a taking of a fundamental right. Further, the Parenting Coordination Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 43, &sect; 120.2-120.3 (2001), bore a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state interest, that being the child's best interest in having two active natural parents. The court also held that the Act was not unconstitutional on procedural or substantive due process grounds. The actions of the trial court did not wrongfully assign the rights of the custodial parent to third parties. However, the trial court erred in failing to include child care costs with base child support for purposes of income assignment per Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1171.2 (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order appointing a parenting coordinator and remanded to allow the trial court to determine the amount owed by the father for income assignment purposes.</SPAN></P>

The mother and father were teenagers at the time that she became pregnant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that because he was a member of an Indian nation, the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1901 et seq., and the Oklahoma Indian Child Welfare Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 40 et seq. (2001), applied and that neither had been followed. The court held that the existing Indian family exception was no longer a viable doctrine in Oklahoma insofar as Indian child custody proceedings were concerned due to legislative amendments to the Oklahoma Act. Under the current statutory scheme, the Oklahoma Act controlled regardless of whether the child involved in the proceeding was in the physical or legal custody of an Indian parent or Indian custodian when state proceedings were initiated. Even if the Indian family exception was still viable, the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the child was eligible for adoption without the father's consent. Although no specific monetary support was given directly to the mother, the father met the minimal statutory requirements to the extent of his ability. He had acknowledged paternity, the mother lived with him and his mother during a significant portion of her pregnancy, and he quit school and obtained a job.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer petitioned for writ of certiorari to the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals after it affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of defendants, Oklahoma Tax Commission, commissioners, and Oklahoma State Treasurer, by finding that Oklahoma's Earned Income Tax Credit statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2357.43 (2001), was constitutional and legal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer alleged violations of various constitutional provisions and argued that the State income tax was for the purpose of providing revenue for general governmental functions and that Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2357.43 permitted the use of income tax revenues to make &quot;direct gifts to the poor.&quot; The appellate court determined that the fiscal policy was to benefit a class of taxpayers that worked, but whose income was below a certain level. It did not constitute the use of a tax for a purpose different from that for which it was collected. The tax credit operated equally upon the class of taxpayers who were entitled to claim it. The legislature decided to benefit a class of taxpayers who worked, but who did not earn substantial wages. It was the duty of the courts to uphold a legislative act unless it plainly and clearly violated the constitution. The taxpayer failed to carry the burden necessary to invalidate the statute. The legislature had authority to create different classes for purposes of taxation; the classification was reasonable, served a legitimate public purpose, and it operated with reasonable uniformity and equality upon the given class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landowners appealed from orders of the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which granted plaintiff municipality's eminent domain request to take the owners' property for purposes of redevelopment of a blighted area, which was done in conjunction with a public trust. The trial court confirmed the amount of the award and overruled the owners' objections to the taking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipality and the public trust jointly created, funded, and operated an economic redevelopment project that included the removal of blighted property. The municipality supplied property to the trust through its eminent domain power in those circumstances where the landowners declined to sell their property. The instant owners declined the trust's offer for their properties, and condemnation proceedings resulted in orders in favor of the municipality. On appeal, the court noted that the Local Development Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 62, &sect;&sect; 850-869 (2001), contained no express grant of eminent domain authority. Accordingly, the municipality's claim that it was authorized by Okla. Stat. tit. 62, &sect; 854(18) (Supp. 2003), in conjunction with its general eminent domain power in Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 22-104(3), (8) (2001), to take the properties lacked merit. In a very thorough review of the redevelopment statutory schemes, it was held that, although the Urban Renewal Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 38-101 to -123 (2001), and the Neighborhood Redevelopment Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 40-101 to -115 (2001), contained such authority, they were not applicable for the joint project involved.</SPAN></P>

The city approved and adopted a tax increment finance project plan ordinance, Ardmore, Okla., Ordinance 2700 (December 27, 2001), which it later amended to comply with new caselaw and the amended Oklahoma Local Development Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 62, &sect; 850 et. seq. (2001). The court held that the tax increment district created by the city complied with Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 6C and the Act. The amended ordinance for the project incorporated the provisions of the Act by reference. Under the Act, the tax increment district created by the city could be repealed or amended at any time by the action of a subsequent governing body, and the city was not obligated to apportion ad valorem taxes beyond its fiscal year. Only the city development authority, a public trust, was indebted on the bonds and, as a public trust, its debt did not violate Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 26.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the judgment of a trial court by granting visitation rights to appellee grandparents subsequent to the termination of the grandparents' guardianship over the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents argued that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction when it granted visitation rights to the grandparents and that, if the visitation order was not void for lack of jurisdiction, it was an unconstitutional intrusion into their family life. The appellate court found that pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 30, &sect; 1-113 (2001) the trial court had jurisdiction over the guardianship until termination of the proceeding. That jurisdiction ended according to law with the finality of the court's termination order, and the court had no power to order the parents to submit to visitation against their wishes. The finding that the trial court had continuing jurisdiction over grandparental visitation rights by reason of Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 5 was unsustainable. There was no action brought pursuant to the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 5(E)(1), and the court was therefore not competent to pass on those statutory issues. The subject matter jurisdiction of the court had not been invoked by proper pleadings to hear and determine a cause.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Oklahoma Development Finance Authority (ODFA) filed an application seeking approval for issuance of industrial development taxable revenue bonds, pursuant to the Oklahoma Quality Jobs Incentive Leverage Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 3651 et seq. (Supp. 2002), for two tire companies. The ODFA also requested that the court assume original jurisdiction over the application. A taxpayer protested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ODFA indicated that the purpose of the bonds was to provide funds to pay or reimburse the two tire companies for a portion of the expansion and re-tooling costs of their Oklahoma manufacturing plants. Bonds had already been authorized for issuance for each company. The court went through a thorough review of the various statutory requirements pursuant to the Act. The court found that the protester failed to meet his burden of showing that the proposed bond issue violated Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 51, as such was found inapplicable to the present circumstances. Further, there was no violation of Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect;&sect; 14 and 15, as the public purpose requirement was met and the sale of the bonds did not constitute a gift or special privilege. There was adequate consideration by the economic incentives to be reaped by the State and the public. The employee withholding taxes were used for proper purposes within the public purpose doctrine. The bonds clearly reflected that they did not create a debt against the State of Oklahoma. The court concluded that the obligations were properly authorized and that the bonds would constitute valid obligations in accordance with their terms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On certiorari from the Court of Civil Appeals (Oklahoma), the supreme court was to determine whether plaintiff insured established entitlement to an award of attorney fees against defendant insurer under an exception to the American Rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured had been awarded attorney fees originally by the trial court as a common law element of recovery on a bad faith claim on an uninsured motorist insurance policy. The question in the current post-remand proceeding was whether the insured established entitlement to an award of attorney fees under an exception to the American Rule. On remand, the insured was given leave to seek attorney fees under an exception, if any, to the American Rule. She sought to assert a statutory basis for the award under Okla. Stat. tit. 36, &sect; 1219, which allowed for attorney fees in certain claims upon &quot;accident and health&quot; policies. The supreme court found that uninsured motorist insurance was not accident and health insurance as defined by &sect; 1219 and Okla. Stat. tit. 36, &sect; 703 (1991). As an exception to the American Rule, the insured sought to recover attorney fees for oppressive litigation conduct under authority of another case. But the conduct complained of was not oppressive conduct during litigation so as to trigger the trial court's inherent power to award attorney fees. The actions complained of did not fall within the bad faith litigation conduct exception to the American Rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court vacated the appellate court's opinion, affirmed the trial court's decision, and held that the insured did not show entitlement to attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed a lawsuit alleging civil rights violation. Rather than paying the filing fee in the trial court, he filed a pauper's affidavit. The prison officials filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that the cause must be dismissed for failure to pay the filing fee pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 57, &sect; 566.2 (2001) because the inmate had, on at least three prior occasions, filed lawsuits that had been dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim. The trial court granted summary judgment and the appellate court affirmed. The supreme court granted certiorari to address the constitutionality of the statute and held that it did not deprive inmates of the due process right to access to courts. Because prisoners were not a suspect class, and the provisions of &sect; 566.2 did not implicate fundamental rights, and were rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of deterring frivolous prisoner lawsuits, no showing had been made that the statute was unconstitutional under either the federal or the State constitution, Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the Oklahoma Attorney General, the Oklahoma Governor, certain district attorneys, and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation requested the court to assume original jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief upholding the constitutionality of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1692.1 et seq. (Supp. 2003), an act banning cockfighting. Respondents, individuals and companies involved in cockfighting, challenged the act's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court chose to assume original jurisdiction because the matter concerned the public interest and an early decision was needed to advise trial courts as to the propriety of enjoining enforcement of the act in the exercise of their equitable power. The court concluded that the cockfighting ban did not constitute an uncompensated taking in violation of U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV or Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 24 because the prevention of cruelty to animals was a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power. There was no impairment of contracts under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 or Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 15 because the Contract Clause had to be accommodated to the state's inherent police power to safeguard vital public interests. Substantive due process under Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 2 was not violated. There was no fundamental right to travel for an illicit purpose. The act did not violate the one-subject rule of Okla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed, by writ of certiorari, from the decision of the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals, Division I, which affirmed the trial court's dismissal of a medical malpractice action based upon its determination that the action was not diligently prosecuted by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary issue on certiorari was the difference between dismissing an action pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1083 (2001) and dismissing an action in the exercise of the trial court's inherent power, as set forth in the first two sentences of Okla. R. Civ. P. 9(b), Okla. Stat. tit. 12, ch. 2, app. (2001). The trial court found that the case should be dismissed for failure to diligently prosecute pursuant to Rule 9(b) and/or &sect; 1083, whichever was applicable. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, holding that &sect; 1083 did not apply in the case, because the case was at issue and that the trial court erroneously used &sect; 1083 criteria in applying its inherent power in Rule 9(b). The court concluded that the first two sentences of Rule 9(b) were authority for a trial court to dismiss an action independent of applying &sect; 1083. Because the record showed that the trial court was using &sect; 1083 as a standard for dismissing the action, as opposed to the common-law standards for dismissing an action pursuant to the first two sentences of Rule 9(b), the court declined to address whether the case was proper for dismissal in advance of the trial court's determination of the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the opinion of the lower appellate court, reversed the judgment of the trial court, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit certified questions of state law to the court, asking if a severability analysis was required and if so, were sections of the law severable from the non-preempted portions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged the right to work law, Okla. Const. art. XXXIII, &sect; 1A, but the trial court rejected plaintiffs' federal constitutional attack and held that the law did not apply to certain employees and thus no preemption issues existed as to those employees covered by federal acts. The trial court further found that certain provisions of the law were preempted. The appellate court submitted certified questions to the court. The court held that rulings by federal courts applying federal law to the effect that certain provisions of the right to work law were subject to preemption, but not invalidation, of some of its terms as to some but not all workers in some but not all situations failed to overcome the presumption of validity to which the law was entitled under Okla. Stat. tit. 75, &sect; 11a(1) (2000). Thus, a severability analysis was not called for. The court further noted that holding the law unconstitutional as contended by plaintiffs would have thwarted the express will of the people in approving the law, and plaintiffs failed to show that the actions of federal courts in declaring certain portions of the law preempted rendered the law unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trade council filed suit in the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma), claiming that Okla. Const. art. 23, &sect; 1A, known as the right to work amendment, was unconstitutional. Both the council and intervenor, an individual in support of the right to work amendment, filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court denied the council's motion and granted the individual's motion. The council appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The council claimed that Okla. Const. art. 23, &sect; 1A was unconstitutional on its face and violated Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 2 and Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 7. The court rejected the council's argument and affirmed the district's court judgment. The court stated that the due process and equal protection clauses of the Bill of Rights of the Oklahoma Constitution provided the same protections as those guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Thus, the council had no right to relief, because the U.S. Supreme Court held more than 50 years ago that right to work laws did not violate either the due process clause or the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The council also claimed that the right to work law violated Okla. Const. art. 24, &sect; 1 and Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 59. The court held that the right to work amendment was not a special law prohibited by Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 59, because Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 59 applied to the legislative department and the right to work law was a constitutional amendment proposed by the legislature and approved by the people under Okla. Const. art. 24, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff charter school applicant brought an action for declaratory judgment seeking to have the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma) determine its right to binding arbitration under the Charter School Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 70, &sect; 3-130 et seq. (2001). The trial court denied the applicant's motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to defendant school district. The applicant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether the trial court erred when it refused to grant the applicant's request for binding arbitration after the school district rejected its application for approval as a charter school. The applicant relied on Okla. Stat. tit. 70, &sect; 3-134(F) (2001) of the Charter Schools Act, which provided that, when an application to establish a charter school was rejected, the unsuccessful applicant could proceed to mediation or binding arbitration or both mediation and binding arbitration, as provided in the Dispute Resolution Act, 12 Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1801 et seq. (2001). The school district contended that binding arbitration under the Charter School Act was legally impossible. It pointed out that the statute's direction was powerless, as the Dispute Resolution Act did not authorize binding arbitration. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court stated that the Dispute Resolution Act clearly authorized only mediation and provided procedures only for mediation. Relying on its provisions as authority for compulsory binding arbitration was, as was determined by the trial court, legally impossible.</SPAN></P>

As the Fund brought its cause of action based upon its alleged contractual obligations, a cause of action expressly authorized by statute, the cause of action was not barred by sovereign immunity. Contrary to the Fund's contention, the supreme court found no language in Okla.

The appellate court then remanded the case for an award of attorney fees. After the trial court entered a large award, it was upheld on review. The corporation then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. On review, the court determined that the reasonable attorney fee in the case was zero. An essential element of a claim under the OCPA was actual damages; therefore, attorney fees were not mandated. The court held that the law of the case doctrine did not apply because the appellate court's prior decision did not decide the reasonableness of the fee. Moreover, an exception to the doctrine applied because the appellate court's decision was palpably erroneous. Further, there was no evidence that the lawsuit stopped any offending conduct.

In vacating the appellate court's decision, the court determined that the judgment was enforceable and valid, as the visitation order was based on the parties' agreement. The district court should have followed the procedures set forth in Okla. Stat. tit. 10, 5(E) in the motion to enforce visitation. Further, the burden was on the mother to show that a change in circumstances adversely affecting the best interest of the child such that the welfare of the child would have been improved by modification of the initial order. The mother was not permitted to litigate the issue of harm without showing a change of circumstances.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature authorized the OCIA to issue state facilities revenue bonds.

Thereafter, the OCIA initiated an original proceeding seeking approval of the proposed bonds. Several individuals objected to the bond proposal. In rejecting the bonds, the court determined that &sect; 301 did not satisfy the purpose-of-borrowing requirement of Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 16. Okla. Stat. tit. 73, &sect; 301(A)(16) (Supp. 1999), as amended by 2000 Okla. Sess. Laws ch. 376, &sect; 1 did not specify the purposes for which the state agencies could have used the bond proceeds. There was no listing of the projects of the state agencies anywhere in &sect; 301. Further, the listing of 12 areas of service where the use of the borrowed money would have effectuated the performance of essential state governmental functions did not disclose the projects. Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 16 required more than just the identity of the agency slated to receive borrowed money.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After heavy flooding of the house, petitioner buyers sued respondent sellers. The buyers applied for certiorari to review a certified interlocutory order from the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which dismissed any theory of liability and any remedy not arising under or permitted by the Residential Property Condition Disclosure Act (RPCDA), Okla. Stat. tit. 60, &sect; 831 et seq. The supreme court granted certiorari review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the period of their ownership, the sellers experienced repeated and heavy flooding of the house. They tried to stop the flooding problems by making repairs; however, the repairs were inadequate to cure the flooding problems and the sellers knew the repairs were inadequate. In order to deceive the buyers, the sellers deliberately concealed the nature and scope of the flooding problems by stating on a disclosure statement that the flooding problem had been repaired. The trial judge dismissed any theory of liability and any remedy raised by the buyers' petition not arising under or permitted by the RPCDA, &sect; 831 et seq. He did so on the basis that the RPCDA abrogated or supplanted any such theory or remedy. In doing so, the trial judge dismissed the common law actual fraud claim pled by the buyers. In that the RPCDA neither expressly nor by necessary implication could be found to have legislatively intended to supplant or abrogate a common law actual fraud claim anchored on alleged misrepresentations concerning material defects in the house made in connection with its sale, or the remedies associated with such a claim, the trial judge erred in dismissing the buyers' fraud claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers submitted a written demand to the city, challenging the lawfulness of a tax increase, with the revenue earmarked for contracts between the city, authority, and group. The taxpayers were denied intervention in the city's action to have the contracts declared lawful because the city was presumed to have prosecuted the action in good faith. The taxpayers' qui tam action against the city, authority, and group was dismissed on preclusion grounds. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying the group's motion for sanctions against the taxpayers and their attorney because it was not objectively unreasonable to file a qui tam action or mount a defense to the motions to dismiss. The flawed argument that the suit was not precluded did not fall below the objective standard of Okla. Stat. Tit. 12, &sect; 2011 (2001), because it was based on an assertion that the city did not diligently prosecute all of the claims in the written demand. The trial court abused its discretion in broadly applying its inherent authority to sanction and granting the defendants' motions for attorney fees because it was irreconcilably at odds with the denial of the &sect; 2011 motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) issued an administrative compliance order stating defendant waste management company failed to obtain a disposal plan, and imposing fines. Prior to its administrative appeal, the company sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the District Court of Major County, Oklahoma. The district court dismissed the action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its petition the company contended that the DEQ's interpretation and enforcement of Okla. Stat. tit. 27A, &sect; 2-10-801(D)(1), unconstitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce, and alternatively that Okla. Admin. Code &sect; 252:205-3-2(c) did not apply to its landfill but, if it did, that the rule unconstitutionally burdened interstate commerce. In sustaining the DEQ's motion to dismiss, the district court expressed the view that the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine presented a jurisdictional bar to consideration of the company's request for relief. The appellate court held that the doctrine expressed a prudential rule, rather than a jurisdictional bar, and that the district court erred when it determined that the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine deprived it of jurisdiction. The appellate court further determined that the company's alternative allegations directly attacked the validity and applicability of the rule in controversy and accordingly that Okla. Stat. tit. 75, &sect; 306 (2001) explicitly conferred jurisdiction on the district court to render a declaratory judgment, without the agency having passed upon the rule in question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the district court dismissing for lack of jurisdiction was reversed, and the cause was remanded with instructions that the district court decide whether the company, in pressing its constitutional claim, could demonstrate a sufficient showing of inadequate administrative remedy and impending harm to overcome the exhaustion of administrative remedies rule.</SPAN></P>

The institution appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the district because it would be unconstitutional for the district to reimburse the institution the $ 238,323, and the district had no legally enforceable obligation to pay it. The district argued that it was not required to reimburse the institution for the school year because it did not actually receive any aid that year. The appellate court found that the purpose of the contract was to outline the specific terms by which the district was to provide education for the children at the juvenile facility. The district was required to reimburse the institution by an amount equal to any state aid it received or became eligible to receive. The district would not recoup a double payment from the institution and the state for its services. Nothing in the agreement obligated the district if the state determined that none of the allocations available were attributable to the children living at the facility. The district's obligation was not a debt for purposes of the constitutional debt limitation pursuant to Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 26. The contract precluded the district from obtaining a double recovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the department of human services argued that the association and the individuals lacked standing and that, contrary to the trial court's determination, the department possessed the constitutional authority to formulate specific policies on how to perform those duties assigned to it by the legislature. The appellate court found that the members of the association (some of the appellee individuals), as taxpayers, possessed standing to challenge the alleged wrongful expenditure of public funds; thus, the association possessed standing to seek injunctive relief to prevent the alleged unlawful expenditure of those funds. However, the trial court's judgment determining the standing of the parents and guardians of the residents of the facility in question (non-association member individuals) was improper, as it was not based upon an allegation of injury to the residents. The appellate court also found that the legislature gave the department the duty of administering the facility, but without specifically vesting contractual powers in the department for the performance of that duty; whether the department possessed those powers depended on whether they were necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ODOT sought approval for $ 100,000,000 in Grant Anticipation Notes. The Contingency Review Board (CRB), the Executive Bond Oversight Commission (EBOC) and the Legislative Bond Oversight Commission all approved the notes although the approval. The state supreme court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 69, &sect; 2001(E)(2) (2001), that required approval by the CRB, and Okla. Stat. tit. 62, &sect; 695.9 (2001), that required approval by the LBOC in the note-approval process, constituted a usurpation by the legislature of the powers of the executive branch and violated Oklahoma's constitutional separation of powers provision as members of the legislature could interfere with the executive branch in the approval of grant anticipation notes. The appellate court held, however that under the rules of statutory construction, the unconstitutional provisions and were severable from the remainder of the statutes. As Okla. Stat. tit. 62, &sect; 695.11A provides that if the LBOC was found to be unconstitutional then the powers, duties and responsibilities of both the EBOC and the LBOC devolved upon the Council of Bond Oversight (CBC), and the CBC had not yet approved the notes, the approval was denied.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that the official record of voter registration served as the authoritative tool for establishing registration and non-registration, and stated explicitly the process used to determine the degree of similarity and accuracy required in comparing a name listed on a petition to the Oklahoma Election Management System.

The District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, entered a judgment establishing a plan proposed by appellee governor as the Congressional redistricting plan to be implemented for Oklahoma. Appellants, state senators, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was determined by the 2000 Census that the number of congressional districts in Oklahoma had to be reduced from six to five because Oklahoma's population had failed to grow as fast as that of many other states since the 1990 Decennial Census. The voters alleged the Oklahoma Legislature had not yet adopted a redistricting plan and that the qualifying deadline for candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives was soon approaching. They requested the trial court ensure enforcement of the laws and adopt and implement a congressional redistricting plan to be in place in sufficient time for the candidate qualification and election process to go forward. On appeal, the senators urged the supreme court to substitute their redistricting plan for the governor's plan. The supreme court refused to do so. After initially determining the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the suit and an obligation to resolve the dispute, the supreme court determined the governor's plan continued the policies of Oklahoma as expressed it its previous redistricting plans. The absence of the Oklahoma Election Board as a party did not deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals argued that the Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 22-159 (2001), was part of the Public Utility Bond Act. The supreme court held, however, that Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 22-159 (2001), was not a part of the Public Utility Bond Act. The legislature had identified the legislation as creating new law, not as amending the bond act. In analyzing the statute, the supreme court determined that its general purpose was to allow a municipality the option to support public school systems that are located, in whole or in part, within the corporate limits of the municipality. The supreme court determined that the statute was constitutional. Therefore, the municipal ordinances of the two cities at issue were authorized sales tax proposals that relied on a constitutional statute and serve a valid public purpose. The supreme court further concluded that the city's school trust was a lawful entity that performed a lawful and constitutional purpose for the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father had been incarcerated for a year and was under a protective order not to communicate with child. The protective order had been issued against him, as he stalked the mother and child, had assaulted the mother in the child's presence, and had forcibly tried to take the child from the mother. The child believed the stepfather was his real father. The father claimed the court could not hold his lack of a relationship with the child against him, as that was the result of a court order. The appellate court held that the father had never assumed his parental responsibilities, nor did he attempt to foster a healthy, loving, and supportive relationship with his child. He instead embarked on intentional acts that evidenced a total disregard for the parent-child relationship and the welfare of the child. As the father's conduct that resulted in the incarceration was in direct contradiction to basic parental obligations, he could not rely on the existence of court orders to excuse his lack of a relationship with the child. The appellate court also found the adoption was in the child's best interest, as the stepfather and the child had a strong bond and close relationship.</SPAN></P>

Successful challenge to 29,864 signatures would render the petition invalid. The undisputed evidence established that the notaries on 1,246 challenged signatures failed to file their bonds. Opponents presented numerous hyper-technical challenges of several thousand additional signatures at the hearing but failed to offer any evidence that a contesting party actually was prejudiced thereby. The Oklahoma Supreme Court found that: (1) the petition was valid in the form required by statutes; (2) the petition was signed by a sufficient number of legal voters of the State of Oklahoma; and (3) that the petition should be submitted to the people for determination. Further, the Oklahoma Supreme Court held that the initiative petition was legally sufficient numerically, and that the ballot title met the standards for submission to the people.</SPAN></P>

The undisputed facts in the record show that the town's corporate limits were &quot;contiguous&quot; to the property sought to be annexed under &sect; 21-114. The City of Claremore, Oklahoma, claimed in its petition that the Town should be estopped from annexing the property. The state supreme court ruled that Claremore's estoppel claim failed as a matter of law.  Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 21-114 (1991) was unconstitutional to the extent that it purported to delegate to the district courts the obligation to decide whether a substantial governmental interest in the use of the property had been demonstrated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The findings established the Workers' Compensation Court trial tribunal denied the employee's claims for medical expenses and temporary total disability benefits because it concluded he did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that physical injury to his heart occurred during his employment as a firefighter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought to modify the existing visitation schedule for appellee father in order for appellant to accept a position as a program analyst for the International Space Station at the headquarters of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Appellee opposed appellant's move, contending the changes in visitation would have been detrimental to the father-son relationship. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in forcing her to give up the NASA position and remain in Oklahoma in order to retain custody of her son. The instant court agreed with appellant, holding that in the absence of a showing of prejudice to the rights or welfare of a child, a custodial parent has a statutory presumptive right to change his or her child's residence. The evidence presented did not support the trial judge's decision restricting appellant from relocating under peril of losing custody. Appellant was a fit mother, and her decision to relocate with her son was a childrearing decision which was well within her right to make as his custodial parent. Maintaining appellee's existing visitation schedule was not a sufficient basis for the denial of appellant's relocation.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the district court's order and remanded the action. The action was time-barred. The record supported only the inference that appellee knew, or with reasonable inquiry would have known, of the facts that would have supported its claim almost seven years before it filed suit. The statute of limitations period, however, was five years. The limitations period could not be avoided by asserting that appellee and appellant were in a fiduciary relationship, thus invoking the common-law rule requiring a trustee to repudiate the trust in order to trigger the governing limitations period; such a result would require appellant's manager to perform an impossible act under state jurisprudence, i.e., abrogation of its statutorily-prescribed fiduciary relationship with appellee.</SPAN></P>

When appellee city refused to pay, appellant filed a lawsuit. The trial court refused to confirm the arbitrator's award, and the appellate court affirmed. The court granted certiorari. The court held, first, that if the contract violated Okla.

Second, the contract did indeed violate &sect; 26, because appellee city could not have created an obligation one year that resulted in a debt in a succeeding year.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's workers' compensation award for permanent partial disability included two credits to respondent employer, one for payments made during a period when petitioner was later determined not to have been disabled and another for overpayments made by a self-insured employer later determined to be liable only for partial rather than total disability, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 41.1(B) (Supp. 1999), a provision that had been found an unconstitutional special law (denying equal protection). Respondent argued that while the statute was admittedly a special statute, it was a permissible special statute because its discriminatory provisions had a rational basis, to encourage self-insurance. The court found no rational basis for treating employees of self-insured employers differently from employees of insured employers, holding the statute unconstitutional in this application as well.

The district court ordered defendant to grant an unrestricted license to the plaintiff. The court of appeals reversed, holding that the plaintiff's appeal had to be made directly to the state supreme court. The court affirmed the district court's order granting plaintiff's license. Because the defendant's denial of plaintiff's application for a medical license did not involve a disciplinary action, the appeal was properly filed in the district court. The record showed that the defendant ignored persuasive evidence of plaintiff's medical training and experience and qualifications as a physician. The defendant's claim that plaintiff's medical training was not substantially equivalent to that of the University of Oklahoma was unpersuasive because defendant had granted plaintiff a temporary license. Defendant's failure to consider these factors was clear error.</SPAN></P>

Respondent Workers' Compensation Court (Court) denied the request, which was affirmed on appeal. On petitioner's previously granted writ of certiorari, the appellate opinion was vacated, and respondent Court's order sustained. It was apparent from the face of the trial tribunal's order that the acceleration-of-payment provision in the award against respondent Fund was in clear violation of the tribunal's restricted authority over the schedule of benefits to be paid, as outlined in Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A tax increment plan, created via an ordinance under a local development act, was adopted, giving an urban renewal authority funds to administer a project plan and to carry out certain provisions of a plan under development agreements. The ordinance established an ad valorem tax apportionment fund, declaring its contents to be funds of a medical authority as designated. The ordinance authorized the medical authority to administer the tax apportionment fund, to issue tax apportionment bonds or notes, and to incur project costs under development agreements. Appellant state treasurer refused to release funds when requested, and a declaratory judgment action was filed. After judgment affirmed the ordinance and plan, appellant state treasurer and other interested parties asserted that the ordinance and plan was unconstitutional. On review, the court indicated that, because the plan obligated the city government to allocate ad valorem taxes collected in the future to retire a long-term debt, it was properly subject to voter approval under Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 26. Therefore, the lower court's ruling was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court held the order denying claimant's claim, as affirmed by the three-judge review panel, was sufficiently definite to allow for judicial review and was supported by competent evidence. Although the original order did not expressly address the factual issues formed by the evidence, implicit in the claim denial was the finding that claimant's back injury resulted from the worsening of a previously adjudicated injury. Further, whether claimant sustained a new injury or a change of condition of a prior injury was a question of fact, and would not be disturbed when supported by competent evidence. However, the court held the appeals court exceeded its authority in mandating a procedure to be followed in future cases raising issues similar to that of claimant. The court held that it was not error for the appeals court to deny claimant the opportunity to reopen his case in chief based upon new evidence because the new evidence was not relevant to the singular issue presented for review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After mortgagor fell behind in payments to plaintiff mortgagees and defendant tax authorities, defendants foreclosed on a real property tax lien that was senior to plaintiffs' lien and also on a personal property tax lien that was junior to it.

To save their interest, plaintiffs were required to pay all taxes due. They sued for a refund of personal property taxes. The court, interpreting statutes so as not to violate due process, held that defendants were required to provide mail notice to known lienholders before proceeding with a tax sale, to give plaintiffs opportunity to establish priority of their lien in a timely manner.

Const. art. 5, &sect; 33 changed the method used to raise revenue, not the meaning of the terms, &quot;revenue bill&quot; or &quot;bill for raising revenue.&quot; The court determined the challenged legislation was not a revenue bill or a bill raising revenue.

The court affirmed concluding that the legislature had not unlawfully delegated its rule-making authority to the counties by allowing them to contract for private operation of county jails. Operating procedure for county jails was a subordinate matter which could properly be determined by each county. The legislature provided adequate standards for jail operations to assist the counties in implementing jail privatization. The constitution granted the legislature the power to alter the duties of sheriffs which it exercised when it enacted the legislation allowing jail-privatization. Further, the county justice authority was a valid public trust and did not exceed its authority by entering into a contract with a private company. The privatization statutes were not special or local laws prohibited by article Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 46.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.7 (Supp. 2009) to support defendant's convictions for first-degree murder because the evidence showed an unprovoked attack on the victims in their rural home; he caused internal trauma to the husband's brain and beat the wife's head and face severely; [3]-The trial court did not err under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2403 (2011) in admitting photographs because they were probative of the disputed issue of defendant's intent to kill the victims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-Defendant's conviction for loitering within the zone of safety of a school after conviction of a sex offense involving a victim under 13 years of age under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1125 (Supp. 2010), was proper because the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. By operation of the specific statutory exemptions in &sect; 1125(A), any sex offender convicted of a registerable offense involving a victim under 13, who was present in the zone of safety without a statutory exemption and the required prior notice to administrators was, by definition, loitering in violation of the law; [2]-There was no ex post facto violation since defendant's conduct was not innocent under the law when committed. The 2010 law did not increase punishment for his offense, or make his crime greater, or require less, or different, testimony than required at the time of the offense to convict him.</SPAN></P>
