</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The civic organizations asserted that 4 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1102(10) violated Pa. Const. art.

The court found that the statute listed nearly a dozen different policies and objectives that the board was to consider, one of which was the social effect provision; this did not constitute legislation that conferred carte blanche legislative power on an administrative agency to declare basic policy questions. To the contrary, it showed a significant channeling of discretion. Furthermore, there was nothing in the anti-delegation clause that required an exhaustive definition of each of these eleven purposes and objectives. The legislature was not constitutionally required to micromanage the administrative agencies it created.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6109, appellee applicant sought a license to carry a firearm, which was denied by appellant Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) because he had committed an act of domestic violence and thus could not obtain a firearm under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 922(g)(9), part of the Federal Gun Control Act. The Office of the Attorney General agreed with the PSP's determination. The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania reversed the denial. The PSP appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth Court held that evidence that the applicant, who had been convicted of simple assault, had committed an act of domestic violence was inadmissible and that the PSP had thus not proven ineligibility for a license. The court held that a statement in a police report describing the victim as the applicant's &quot;live in girlfriend&quot; was not untrustworthy under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6104. The police report contained no obvious errors, and there was no indication that the statement that the victim lived with the applicant came from an unreliable source. The applicant and the victim had no apparent contemporaneous reason to lie about whether they were living together as boyfriend and girlfriend, and it was not unreasonable to assume that the investigating officer would need to probe their relationship in order to make a charging decision. Thus, the disputed evidence was admissible. An administrative agency law judge, however, had applied Pennsylvania law, rather than federal law, in determining what was required to prove a domestic relationship. It was not clear whether this had been properly challenged or what the consequences of a challenge would be. Thus, the case was to be remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the Commonwealth Court's decision. It remanded the case to the Commonwealth Court for proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated action, the state challenged orders of the Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which found unconstitutional the lifetime registration, notification, and counseling (RNC) provisions that applied to sexually violent predators pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9795.1-.3, 9796, 9797, 9798 of Pennsylvania's Registration of Sexual Offenders Act (Megan's Law II), 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;  9791 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants pled guilty or were convicted of, inter alia, rape. The trial court held that because Megan's Law II did not allow for reassessment of a defendant at any time after a sentence was imposed, the RNC sanctions were overbroad and violated due process rights and that the RNC provisions were excessive and punitive. On appeal, the court first found that the matter was ripe for review. However, the court held that the lifetime RNC provisions were not unconstitutional. Defendants failed to demonstrate that the remedial regime was so unreliable and deficient that the RNC provisions were constitutionally punitive and warranted the safeguards of Apprendi. Overinclusiveness was not dispositive where the danger posed to society was so great. The clearest proof required to demonstrate that the sanctions had a punitive character notwithstanding the legislature's contrary intent stated in 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;  9791 could not be satisfied merely by providing evidence in favor of a more generous account of the likelihood of rehabilitation than that found by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in requiring registration of sex offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower courts' orders and remanded the cases for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of methamphetamine-related charges. The Superior Court (Pennsylvania) affirmed his conviction. Defendant appealed. He argued that the charges against him should have been dismissed because  sheriff's deputies lacked the authority independently to investigate and prosecute offenses under the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 780-101 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that it had previously held that sheriffs were not investigative or law enforcement officers for purposes of the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5701 et seq., because they lacked authority to conduct investigations of or to make arrests for the predicate offenses of the act, including offenses under the Controlled Substance Act. This holding controlled the present case. Moreover, the previous holding underscored a court's duty to strictly construe any statute that granted the authority to invade Pennsylvania's constitutional right of privacy. Accordingly, absent specific statutory authorization, sheriffs lacked authority to conduct independent investigations under the Controlled Substances Act, including the seeking of search warrants where no breach of the peace or felony had occurred in their presence. Here, sheriff's deputies had conducted an unwarranted investigation of private property based on suspicion rather than the commission of any felony or breach of the peace in their presence; thus, the resulting search was illegal. Next, the proper remedy when evidence had been discovered by an illegal search was suppression, not dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the Superior Court's opinion. It remanded the case with direction to the Superior Court to remand the case to the trial court with direction to suppress all evidence discovered through the sheriff's deputies' illegal investigation, and to conduct further proceedings as necessary.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner gaming company filed an emergency petition for review in the state supreme court to challenge the ordinance's constitutionality and sought issuance of a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The General Assembly enacted a law that provided for slot machine gaming at a set number of licensed facilities within the Commonwealth. Under the law, an entity was permitted to apply to the state gaming control board for a license. The gaming company applied for a slot machine license to be located at a licensed facility on property it owned. At that time, the property was zoned for commercial use. The city council then enacted an ordinance that required the submission of entertainment facility development plans. Upon approval of the plan, all underlying zoning classifications on property were superseded. After the gaming company petitioned for a slot machine license, the zoning for the gaming company's property was changed to a residential classification. The gaming company challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance and sought a petition for writ of mandamus, but the state supreme court found the constitutional challenge was not ripe because the ordinance had not yet been applied to the land at issue and that it could not consider the mandamus request since the relevant statute allowing for appeal, 4 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1506, allowed for appellate, not original, jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court dismissed without prejudice the gaming company's request that the state supreme court review the constitutionality of the city council's ordinance that changed the zoning designation of property the gaming company owned and on which a licensed gaming facility had been located. Also, the state supreme court transferred the gaming company's petition for writ of mandamus to a specified trial court.</SPAN></P>

A forensic DNA analysis established that all the blood and tissue recovered by the officers came from the bear whose carcass was seized at defendant's residence. The trial court held that the bait piles were not within the curtilage of the camp, and the appellate court found that defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy under Pa. Const. art.

I, &sect; 8 suggested that open fields were entitled to the same degree of privacy as one's person or home. Pennsylvania history and jurisprudence from states with similar provisions weighed strongly against any notion that open fields were entitled to the same heightened privacy as one's person or home.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pennsylvania Superior Court entered a judgment that affirmed the trial court's judgments of conviction that found defendant guilty following a bench trial of 28 counts of Sexual Abuse of Children in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6312(d) for images of child pornography that defendant had on his home computer. It then imposed sentence on defendant on each of the 28 offenses, to be served concurrently. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police learned that defendant had images on his home computer of children engaging in sex acts and investigated. They determined that there were more than 1,300 images of child pornography in both video format and still photographs there. He was arrested and charged with multiple counts of Sexual Abuse of Children in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6312(d), which prohibited individuals from knowingly possessing specified material depicting children less than 18-years-old engaging in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such an act. 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6312(a) made depictions of such nudity illegal if it was for sexual stimulation or gratification. After defendant was convicted on 28 counts and given concurrent sentences on the convictions, the appellate court affirmed. On further review, the state supreme court found that 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6312(d) was neither unconstitutionally vague, since it gave sufficiently clear notice of the prohibited conduct, nor overbroad, as the nudity depicted had to be for sexual stimulation or gratification. It further found that each item possessed was to be treated as a separate offense and, thus, separate punishments could be imposed for each conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank sought judicial review in the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania) of an order of the Board of Finance and Revenue resettling the bank's reports of its liability for bank shares taxes, under 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 7701 - 7706, and ordering the bank to pay additional taxes. The Commonwealth Court affirmed the order of the Board of Finance &amp; Revenue, and the bank sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank said the bank shares tax should be levied on its sole shareholder, but its shareholder could not constitutionally be taxed because it was a foreign corporation. The supreme court found the bank, not its shareholder, paid the tax, the calculation of which was based on the book value of the bank's net assets. Under a three-part test to find the tax's true incidence, considering (1) whether the state could collect the tax from the bank's depositors should the bank fail to pay it, (2) whether the bank was relieved of liability as to interests of depositors who had an account on the tax's assessment date but withdrew their deposits before the tax collection date, and (3) whether the bank, should it pay the tax, had a legal right to indemnification from the depositors, the Commonwealth had no enforcement authority against shareholders, the second factor was not implicated, as shares of stock subsisted when sold, and, under the third factor, once the bank paid the tax, it had no statutory means to force shareholders to indemnify it. The tax's practical effect was to tax the bank's net assets rather than its shareholders, so it was, effectively, the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered defendant's direct appeal from a sentence of death imposed by the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania) following defendant's conviction for first-degree murder (18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2502) and the related crimes of robbery, burglary, theft by unlawful taking or disposition, aggravated assault, criminal mischief, unlawful restraint, theft by receiving stolen property, and criminal conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for first-degree murder, as the Commonwealth presented expert testimony from a forensic pathologist concerning examination of the victim's body and the pathologist's opinion that the cause of death was homicide. Testimony from defendant's co-conspirators directly implicated defendant as the killer, and was corroborated by circumstantial evidence regarding defendant's financial position before and after the murder, the theft of the gun used in the murder, and defendant's role in opening a safe, distributing the money, and disposing of the evidence. Although the trial court arguably confused the jury by instructing them to consider a trooper's statement regarding a conversation with defendant's friend &quot;for the truth of the statement,&quot; the trial court properly cleared up the confusion by clarifying that they should &quot;consider it simply for the fact that (the friend) made the statement.&quot; Therefore, not only was the trooper's reference to the friend's statement not hearsay (Pa. R. Evid 801(c)), but to the extent the trial court confused the jury, it also cured any potential confusion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The verdict of first-degree murder and the sentence of death were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While a senator, the retiree accrued Class A benefits; while a judge, he accrued Class E-1 rather than Class A benefits.

It ruled that under 71 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5306(a.1), his senate service did not qualify him for Class AA membership, and that his request for Class D-4 membership was time barred. The lower court held (1) SERB violated the retiree's equal protection rights by denying conversion of his Class A service to Class AA, and (2) his application for Class D-4 membership was timely, but its denial did not violate his constitutional rights. The high court held that as there was a rational basis for precluding Class E-1 members, who received more benefits than Class A members, from obtaining enhanced benefits under Class AA, 71 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5306(a.1) was constitutional. Under 71 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5306.2(a), the retiree was ineligible for Class D-4 membership since he was not a senator when he applied. 71 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5306(a.2)'s exclusion of former legislators from Class D-4 membership did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The General Assembly did not intend for the electorate of a first class city to be given the opportunity to consider, approve, disapprove, nullify, or otherwise affect the Board's decision once it was made or to prevent its implementation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth appealed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County (Pennsylvania) which declared a portion of Pennsylvania's DUI statute,&nbsp;75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped defendant's vehicle and noticed signs of intoxication as well as the presence of illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia in the vehicle. Defendant was arrested and transported to a hospital, where chemical testing revealed a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of 0.19 percent. He was thereafter charged with DUI pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802, as well as multiple drug offenses. Defendant filed an omnibus pretrial motion which included a motion to dismiss the DUI count based upon the asserted unconstitutionality of &sect; 3802. The trial court declared &sect; 3802&nbsp;unconstitutional, and granted the motion to dismiss the DUI count. The trial court indicated that the DUI statute was overly broad and created an improper conclusive presumption that, if defendant's BAC was above the threshold at the time of testing, then it had to have been above the threshold at the time of driving. The appellate court held that those issues had already been decided and &sect; 3802 was constitutional. Thus, the trial court erred in dismissing the DUI count.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed his petition for post-conviction relief, pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9541-9546. Appellant was convicted for first-degree murder and the death sentence was imposed. The court noted that appellant's petition was governed by the previous version of the PCRA, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9543.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction stemmed from the murder of a 74-year-old man wherein appellant and his co-defendant, along with another youth, decided to rob the victim at his home. In preparation for the robbery, it was shown that appellant armed himself with a 20-gauge shotgun. In dismissing appellant's petition, the PCRA court explained why all of appellant's claims were either previously litigated, waived, or not cognizable under the PCRA. The court acknowledged that many of appellant's claims were waived as a result of previously litigating the same or failing to raise the issues. However, as to appellant's claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel as a result of his appellate counsel failing to raise trial counsel's failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of appellant's trial, the court was unable to accept the PCRA court's reasoning in support of its rejection of that claim that trial counsel chose not to present mitigation evidence in an effort to keep the jury from viewing appellant as a continuing danger to others. The court was unable to ascertain the extent of trial counsel's awareness of any mitigation proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order of the PCRA court and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing on appellant's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present background and mental health mitigation evidence during the penalty phase of his capital case. In all other respects, the court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the applicant asserted that the Board conducted private deliberations to discuss the merits of the applications, in violation of the open meeting provisions of the Sunshine Act, 65 Pa.C.S. &sect; 704. The court disagreed, finding that the Board's deliberations fell within the recognized exception to the Sunshine Act for quasi-judicial deliberations since, in its functioning, the Board had to consider detailed confidential information regarding the applicants and their proposals, which were properly deliberated in executive sessions prior to the vote before the public. The court rejected the applicant's argument that two recusing Board members possessed the potential to exert undue influence on other Board members as mere speculation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Originally five applicants were involved in seeking the licenses. The Board found that all five applicants were suitable and, therefore, considered which proposals best served the Commonwealth's and public's interests in making its decision. Further, because 4 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1304(b) placed a mileage limitation on the location of the gaming facilities, the Board could only award a license to petitioner or intervenor. The Board based its decision approving the application of intervenor upon finding that intervenor's proposal best served the objectives of the Act, with the location of intervenor's facility providing a location conducive to economic development and gaming without overburdening local services. On appeal, petitioner asserted various procedural irregularities and other claims of error. However, the court was unwilling and unable to surmount the broad discretion granted to the Board in approving an application. The court noted that it was within the Board's discretion to ignore any deadlines or procedures nor made a capricious decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant paternal grandparents sued appellees, the divorced mother and father of their grandchildren, seeking partial custody under &sect; 5312 (23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5312) of the Pennsylvania Domestic Relations Code. The Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, Pennsylvania, held that 23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5312 violated the Equal Protection Clause and dismissed the grandparents' suit. They appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father did not oppose the grandparents' suit, but was joined as a necessary party. Section 5312 provided for grandparent visitation of a child only when the child's parents were divorced, divorcing, or separated for six months or more; standing to obtain partial custody or visitation was not afforded to grandparents of children whose parents were married and living together. The trial court held that &sect; 5312's disparate treatment of intact families and divorced or separated parents violated equal protection principles. The high court disagreed. As the mother's interest in the care, direction, and control of her children was a fundamental right under the Due Process Clause, infringement of such right required strict scrutiny review to determine whether the infringement was supported by a compelling state interest and was narrowly tailored to effectuate that interest. Section 5312 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the State had compelling interest in the children's wellbeing, there was a heightened risk of harm arising from the breakdown of a marriage, and the classification under &sect; 5312 was directly and narrowly tailored to such breakdowns.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court first noted that 4 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1204 expressly gave it exclusive appellate jurisdiction in the matter. It then found that the concerned parties lacked standing to appeal because they were not a party to the proceedings before the state gaming control board and did not intervene in those proceedings. It also found that they did not have standing to lodge a constitutional challenge because they did not have a direct, substantial, and immediate interest in the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a TV station and a newspaper, sought to secure the names and addresses of the impaneled jurors in a criminal trial. They were denied access by the trial court, and appealed, arguing that the trial court's order violated the common law right of access and the constitutional right of access to criminal trials guaranteed by the First Amendment and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The Superior Court, Pennsylvania, affirmed. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In Pennsylvania, impaneled jurors' names and addresses in criminal cases were not subject to a common law right of access. However, an &quot;experience and logic&quot; analysis demonstrated that the First Amendment and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, which provided a coextensive right of access, provided a qualified right of access to jurors' names. This qualified right of access provided the public with enough information to confirm the identity of jurors when necessary, furthered the objective of a fair trial to the defendant, and gave assurances of fairness to society as a whole. There was no First Amendment right of access to jurors' addresses, however, in light of a legitimate need to protect the privacy interests of average citizens were called to serve on juries. In the instant court, the trial court refused appellants' request for access to the impaneled jurors' names because the case was widely publicized and sensationalized. But the trial court did not offer record findings demonstrating that closure was essential to preserve higher values and was narrowly tailored to serve that interest. In the absence of particularized findings, the refusal to disclose the jurors' names was unwarranted.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 303.1 et seq. Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence; the Pennsylvanian Superior Court affirmed. He sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As defendant had no criminal record, the Sentencing Guidelines' standard range was a minimum sentence of six to 14 months. The trial court justified the longer sentence it imposed on the following grounds: the victim was only 14, while defendant was in his mid-30s; defendant was a confidant of the victim and her family; the victim described the sexual acts as &quot;coarse&quot;; and she suffered adverse psychological effects. Defendant argued that the sentence violated the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by Blakely because the reasons for the enhancement were not established by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The intermediate appellate court held that Blakely did not apply to Pennsylvania's indeterminate Sentencing Guidelines. The high court noted that as the Guidelines were purely advisory, trial courts could sentence defendants outside the Guidelines. As defendant was sentenced within the statutory maximum sentence provided by 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 106(b)(3), the fact that the trial court considered material not admitted in his guilty plea in departing from the sentencing guidelines was constitutionally irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged with misdemeanor driving under the influence (DUI) under 75 Pa.C.S. 3802(a)(1), (2). In a pretrial motion, appellee challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 3802(a)(2) under the U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, found 75 Pa.C.S. 3802(a)(2)&nbsp;unconstitutional and dismissed the related count. The Commonwealth appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(a)(2) was not invalid based upon reasoning applicable to the invalidation of 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3731 (repealed) because, unlike &sect; 3731, 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(a) was not simply an amendment to an existing DUI law intended to provide an alternate means of conviction for the offense, but instead represented a wholesale redrafting of the DUI law reflecting a redefinition of the offense. While the offense was defined by reference to a blood alcohol content (BAC) measurement taken some time after driving, the prohibited conduct was drinking excessively and then driving, a conclusion buttressed by the title of 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802, and statutes that prohibited driving after drinking by reference to a threshold BAC level were not unconstitutionally vague. Furthermore, the statute was not constitutionally overbroad because its two-hour rule, which applied to drivers who drank a sufficient amount of alcohol and then drove such that their blood alcohol content was in the prohibited range within two hours after driving, versus all other drivers, was rationally related to the Commonwealth's valid interest in curbing alcohol-related roadway accidents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order was reversed insofar as it invalidated &sect; 3802(a)(2). The matter was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the appellate court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washington County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania) ruled that 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-1080&nbsp;unconstitutionally conflicted with Pa. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7 and that it therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction over appellant former employee's challenge, based on 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-1080, to appellee school board's termination of him as school district superintendent. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was accused of sexual harassment and sexual discrimination. He appeared at a hearing represented by counsel and, the trial court determined, had sufficient opportunity to respond to the charges. The board held a public meeting at which it unanimously voted to discharge him. The trial court held that because appellant was a &quot;civil officer&quot; within the meaning of Pa. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7, who was appointed by the board, the board had the absolute power to remove him under Pa. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7. The trial court thus held that 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-1080 was unconstitutional because it placed limitations on the authority of the Board to remove a superintendent from office. The high court disagreed. Section 10-1080 did not conflict with Pa. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7 because the limitations it imposed on the board's authority to remove superintendents concerned matters bearing on the superintendents' &quot;behaving themselves well while in office&quot; within the meaning of Pa. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7. The trial court plainly had jurisdiction to entertain such a challenge. As appellant failed to develop reasons why the high court should address his second, ancillary issue, it declined to do so.</SPAN></P>

He appealed, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and arguing that he could not be convicted of attempted escape because that crime had not been charged. The Pennsylvania Superior Court, agreeing with the second contention, reversed his conviction and vacated his judgment of sentence. The Commonwealth appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant tried to duck under a correctional officer's arm in an apparent, but unsuccessful, attempt to escape from a prisoner transportation van. The intermediate appellate court held that as the escape statute did not proscribe an attempt to escape, defendant's conviction for the crime of attempted escape could not stand because he had not been separately charged with attempt to escape; it did not address defendant's sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim. The high court held that a defendant could be convicted of an offense included in an offense charged in the indictment or the information, even if the lesser-included offense had not been charged. An offense was a lesser-included offense for purposes of this rule when, inter alia, it consisted of an attempt to commit the offense charged, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 901(a). This rule comported with due process, as the evidence the prosecution had to present to show that a defendant committed the crime of escape, if sufficient, was necessarily sufficient to show that he took a substantial step toward committing that crime; thus, there was no unfair surprise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court reversed the order of the intermediate appellate court and remanded the matter to that court for consideration of defendant's claim that the evidence had been insufficient to convict.</SPAN></P>

Two women in the home were able to identify appellant, with one being in the same room watching appellant and his accomplice beat the victim then shooting him in the head. Appellant had a significant history of violent crime felony convictions and received the death sentence. Appellant was appointed new counsel for purposes of direct appeal. On appeal from the denial of his PCRA petition, appellant asserted numerous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court only addressed the ineffective assistance claims related to trial counsel's ineffectiveness as it was a necessary element of appellate counsel's ineffectiveness. The court found no ineffectiveness with regard to defense counsel not calling any alleged alibi witnesses since the trial court conducted a colloquy with appellant and discerned that appellant knowingly assented to the decision not to present alibi witnesses. Further, the jury was given a curative instruction with regard to seeing appellant briefly in a hallway with shackles.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was based on the board's actions in outsourcing background investigations to three private firms rather having the state police conduct such investigations. The association claimed that the board's actions violated separation of powers principles as set forth in Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 and art. IV, &sect; 2. Upon consideration, the court denied the association's application, finding that it did not have original jurisdiction under 4 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1904 as the association's application did not seek a finding that the Act was unconstitutional. While the association argued that its challenge was constitutional based on the separation of powers argument, the court held that the association's actual complaint was not that the Act itself was unconstitutional, but that the board's conduct misconstrued the Act and applied it improperly. The association actually sought enforcement of the Act, albeit pursuant to its interpretation of the Act's terms. The court therefore transferred the action to the commonwealth court pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 751 because that court had original jurisdiction over all civil actions or proceedings against a commonwealth party under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 761.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employer and the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review sought review of an order from the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which vacated the Board's order that found claimant former employee ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits (UCBs). The trial court held that it was error for the employer to have been represented at a hearing before a referee by a non-attorney &quot;tax consultant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked as a beauty advisor and after a rude customer confronted her, she used an obscenity when telling the customer to leave. Although the employee was not immediately terminated, as she could have been pursuant to the employee handbook, she was terminated upon her return from a one-week vacation. The employee's application for UCBs was denied upon a determination that she was ineligible for benefits, and she appealed. At a hearing before a referee, wherein the employer was represented by a non-employee, non-lawyer, the employee was deemed to have engaged in willful misconduct which made her ineligible for UCBs under 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;802(e). The Board affirmed the referee's determination. However, the trial court reversed that decision upon finding that the referee erred in allowing the employer to have been represented by the non-attorney. On further review, the court initially determined that such representation by the non-lawyer did not constitute the practice of law. Further, the Unemployment Compensation Law permitted such representation of an employer in UCB proceedings, based on &sect; 502 of the Law, 43 Pa Stat. Ann. &sect; 822.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the owner and operator of a licensed continuing care retirement community (the facility), challenged the order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed a trial court order that denied exemption from real estate tax purposes to appellant, pursuant to Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2(a)(v). Appellees, a county, a school district, a borough, and a board of assessment were also parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of assessment had originally determined that appellant no longer qualified for the charitable tax exemption based on its independent living apartments not being used for charitable purposes. On appeal, appellant argued that the trial court had erred in denying it a tax exemption by looking separately at the parcel of land on which the independent living apartments was located, rather than treating appellant as a single institution in evaluating its claim of entitlement to tax exemption for the entire parcel. The court agreed with appellant, concluding that it was undisputed that it qualified as an institution of purely public charity under the case law standards. In applying the rebuttable presumption set forth in 10 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 376(a)(1) and (b), the court held that there was no dispute as to appellant's institutional status and that in evaluating the real property of an institution, the basic unit of the corporation was not subject to division. Rather, the court's evaluation had to focus on the corporation overall. As such, the court found that appellant's express corporate and charitable purpose was to provide a home and care for the aged and infirm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania refiled charges against defendant, arising from misconduct that she allegedly committed while acting as a public tax collector. She successfully moved to dismiss two of the charges, for alleged violations of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3927(a), 3922(a). The Commonwealth appealed after the Superior Court of Pennsylvania affirmed a common pleas court's order dismissing those charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in January 2003 with violating 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3927(a), 3922(a), and several specific misdemeanor tax collection law crimes. A district court dismissed the 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3927(a), 3922(a), charges, which were general felony theft charges, pursuant to precedent that held that state law did not allow prosecutions under general penal code provisions when special penal provisions were available. The Commonwealth refiled the 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3927(a), 3922(a), charges after 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9303 took effect on February 7, 2003. Section 9303 provided that defendants could be prosecuted under all available criminal statutes, regardless of the generality or specificity of the statutes. Defendant successfully argued that &sect; 9303 could not be applied retroactively to her case and that, therefore, she could not be prosecuted under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3927(a), 3922(a). The court agreed with the Superior Court's finding that while 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9303 arguably was a procedural statute, it had a substantive effect on defendants facing criminal charges. Because &sect; 9303 was substantive, it could not be applied retroactively. The 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3927(a), 3922(a), charges were properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court held that under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7003 of the former Pennsylvania Ignition Interlock Law, PennDOT could not order such devices installed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the driver was convicted of his ninth driving under the influence (DUI) offense, the criminal trial court sentenced him to time served, but for some unknown reason, did not order him to install ignition interlock devices on his vehicles, as was required by the former Ignition Interlock Law due to his multiple convictions. The intermediate appellate court held that PennDOT had no independent authority under former 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7003 to enforce the ignition interlock requirement if the trial court failed to do so. The high court disagreed. The plain language of &sect; 7003(2) clearly dictated that a person subject to the Interlock Law had to apply to PennDOT for an interlock-restricted license as a condition of the restoration of his driving privileges, or suffer a further term of license suspension. Though the high court had struck and severed certain provisions in the prior Interlock Law requiring the trial courts to order installation of ignition interlock devices when sentencing DUI offenders, the Interlock Law could be fairly and reasonably read to effectuate the legislative intention without the provisions that were severed.</SPAN></P>

Eventually, defendant entered a negotiated guilty plea to, inter alia, one count of violating the Pennsylvania Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 911 et seq. He did not file a direct appeal. However, he later filed an amended post-conviction petition in which he claimed that the evidence did not establish that crime. While his petition was pending, the state supreme court decided Besch, which held that the statute was not intended to criminalize wholly illegitimate enterprises, such as his drug dealing. The trial court then denied the petition and did not address defendant's amended petition, which cited Besch. When defendant's case moved to the federal court's, the federal appellate court certified the question of whether Besch was a new rule of law that could not be applied retroactively. The state supreme court found Besch was not a new rule, but the interpretation of an existing statute.</SPAN></P>

Transferring that intent to an unintended victim was permitted by 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 303 and provided the rational connection. The trial court did not err in admitting a shooting victim's statement as excited utterances under Pa. R. Evid. 803(2) where less than 10 minutes after being shot, the victim identified appellant as one of the shooters while the victim was bleeding from his gunshot wound and awaiting transport to the hospital. Approximately 30 minutes later, the victim confirmed this fact when responding to questions posed by the police officers by stating that appellant was one of the shooters.</SPAN></P>

Nevertheless, the officers then checked on who was actually under-age for the purposes of alcohol consumption by checking defendant's drivers' licenses for identification. The officers then administered preliminary breath tests and questioned defendants about whether they had been drinking. As a result, under-age drinking citations were issued. The suppression court granted defendants' motion to suppress. The Commonwealth appealed. The trial court then affirmed the suppression court's ruling. On further review, the state supreme court found that since the police officers were engaged in a general search for criminal wrongdoing, their detention of defendants lacked a paramount public interest and the suspicionless stop of them violated their state and federal constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a negotiated plea of guilty to various sexual offenses in exchange for an agreement that he be sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of six to fourteen years. The trial court accepted the pleas and declared defendant to be a sexually violent predator (SVP). The Superior Court (Pennsylvania) reversed the SVP determination. The Commonwealth appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth argued that it proved that defendant was an SVP by clear and convincing evidence and that, in overturning the trial court's judgment, the superior court panel majority impermissibly substituted its judgment for that of the trial court. The supreme court agreed, finding that the superior court erred in reweighing the SVP evidence presented to the trial court, rather than simply assessing the legal sufficiency of the proof respecting SVP status accepted by the trial court, and further erred in requiring greater proof than was required by the statute. Among other things, the supreme court concluded that the superior court stepped beyond its authority when it reweighed the evidence, giving more weight to &quot;absent&quot; factors than to those found and relied upon by the trial court and ignoring the Commonwealth's expert explanation of the relevance of the absent factors. In addition, the supreme court concluded that the superior court 's analysis was problematic because there was no valid basis for its assumption that an expert's diagnosis of pedophilia required more than proof of sexual assaults upon children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the superior court was reversed, and the trial court's SVP determination was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of sentence for voluntary manslaughter of an unborn child, alleging first that the Crimes Against the Unborn Child Act violated due process under the void-for-vagueness doctrine. The supreme court disagreed, finding that the definition of unborn child, which included all stages from gestation to fertilization to live birth, was straightforward and not obscure or difficult to grasp. It was also clear that, by that definition, any viability requirement was eliminated. Defendant also maintained that the statute was unconstitutionally broad because it failed to distinguish between viable living organisms and nonviable or nonliving organisms. After concluding that such a claim sounded in substantive due process, the supreme court held that defendant's liberty interest was not affected by the Act as compliance would not result in confinement. Defendant's challenge under the Equal Protection Clause also failed, as the General Assembly had a legitimate basis for distinguishing between the mother and everyone else. Finally, the supreme court held that trial court's failure to define criminal negligence as it related to the unborn child was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant raised a total of twenty-two claims. Appellant claimed that his direct appeal counsel was ineffective for failing to raise his trial counsel's tolerance of the prosecutor's repeated prejudicial conduct. Regarding the prosecutor's remarks made during his closing arguments, the instant court found that the prosecutor's statement was a fair response to defense counsel's largely improper and baseless implication that the prosecutor would behave unethically, or indeed criminally, in order to win cases. Appellant also claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate, develop, and present mitigating evidence of his alleged organic brain damage and traumatic childhood. The instant court found that the deficiencies in appellant's proffer were certainly fair game, both as a matter of credibility and as a matter of assessing the ultimate question. But they were matters that should be assessed only after a hearing where the credibility of appellant's experts, his family members, and his trial counsel could properly be evaluated. Accordingly, the appropriate course was to remand this layered ineffectiveness claim to the PCRA court for an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

The subject property was a neighborhood shopping center located within the school district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1996-97, the county assessed the subject property at approximately $ 5,800,000 as part of a county-wide reassessment in which all real estate was assessed at 100 percent of its fair market value. In March 1999, the owner purchased the property for approximately $ 10,400,000. The school district appealed the $ 5,800,000 assessment, and the county board increased the assessment for tax year 2000 to $ 6,500,000. The school district again appealed, seeking to have the assessment further increased to $ 8,500,000. The parties had stipulated that, for tax year 2000, the fair market value of the property was $ 8,500,000 and that the common level ratio for the county was 85.2 percent of fair market value. The trial court upheld the assessment, stating that the school district's proofs regarding comparables was irrelevant. The court held that the trial court erred by refusing to consider the common law procedure for asserting a uniformity challenge as 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5349(d.2) did not supersede the methods of determining uniformity as established by the court. As such, the trial court erred by disregarding the school district's uncontradicted valuation testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, appealed from an order of the Superior Court, Pennsylvania, which concluded that it did not have jurisdiction under Pa.R.A.P. 311(d) to review the recusal motion, and that the Commonwealth had a right to a jury at a degree of guilt hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth asserted the text of Rule 311(d) did not bar review of recusal rulings. The instant court found that the Commonwealth certified in good faith that denial of its recusal motion would substantially handicap its prosecution of this case. Indeed, if the judge was unable to preside and serve as fact-finder impartially, and an unfair verdict was rendered, the Commonwealth, unlike a criminal defendant in a similar circumstance, had no appellate recourse. In considering the merits of the recusal issue, the instant court found the judge should have recused herself. The instant court reasoned that telling the accused that she was going to work hard to do things for her was inappropriate for an impartial jurist. The second question was whether the Commonwealth was entitled to demand a jury at a degree of guilt hearing when a defendant pleaded guilty to murder generally. The instant court found that by pleading guilty to murder generally, appellee waived her right to have a jury as fact-finder in her case. Waiving one's right, however, did not constitute waiver of another's corresponding right; appellee could not vitiate the Commonwealth's right by waving her own.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court reversed the quashal of the Commonwealth's appeal from the denial of its recusal motion and remanded for the appointment of another judge in this matter. The court affirmed the order reversing the denial of the Commonwealth's request for a jury at appellee's degree of guilt hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth, challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County (Pennsylvania), which granted defendant's motion to quash after the parolee was charged with violating 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9795.2(d)(2) and 9796(e)(2) by failing to register his address with the Pennsylvania State Police and failing to provide the Pennsylvania State Police with the annual address verification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to aggravated indecent assault, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3125, and indecent assault, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3126, both offenses of which were predicate crimes under Megan's Law II (Act), 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9791- 9799.9, 2000 Pa. Laws 74 and subjected defendant to the lifetime reporting requirements. As a result of the violations, the parole was revoked, and defendant was re-sentenced on his original conviction. On appeal, the court found that defendant was subject to the penalty for the underlying offense, the applicable registration provisions of the Act, and the sanctions imposed upon violation of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9795.2(d)(2) and 9796(e)(2), all of which were plainly visible on the face of the governing statute, and none of which depended on judicial fact-finding under a diminished standard of proof. The reporting requirements and penalties for non-compliance were merely a consequence of defendant's underlying conviction for the predicate offense and raised no Apprendi concerns. Thus, the Act's provisions imposing criminal liability for non-compliance were constitutional. However, defendant's claim of excessive punishment claim was not squarely before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the lower court and remanded the case for consideration of defendant's remaining claims delineated in his motion to quash.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured party sued appellees for negligence. Although the jury returned a verdict for appellant, because the same 10 jurors did not agree as to all of the questions material to the verdict and award, appellees moved for a mistrial.

Ten jurors agreed on the amount of damages; jurors four and nine answered Interogatory 6 by stating that he should receive a smaller award. The intermediate appellate court held that the &quot;verdict&quot; on which five-sixths of the jurors had to agree under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5104(b) and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 was comprised of the total verdict inclusive of each interrogatory response. The high court disagreed. This &quot;same-juror rule&quot; would unconstitutionally burdened a litigant's constitutional right to a jury of 12. The verdict was proper because at least 10 jurors agreed appellees were negligent; at least 10 jurors agreed that appellant's contributory negligence was not a substantial factor in bringing about his harm; and at least 10 jurors agreed as to the amount of damages appellant was entitled to. The same 10 did not have to agree on all these issues. With a general verdict, as long as 10 jurors agreed with the finding and award, there was no issue regarding whether the requisite five-sixths concurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a group of newspapers and a reporter (the newspapers) filed an application for review challenging a grand jury subpoena requiring the production of computer hardware, which application was styled as an emergency. Respondent, the Office of Attorney General, challenged an order requiring disclosure of the notice that it used to submit the underlying investigation to the grand jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspapers were served with two subpoenas issued under the authority of a grand jury, commanding it to produce four computer workstations and two additional computer hard drives. The newspaper initiated proceedings before the judge supervising the grand jury proceedings, seeking to quash the subpoena as overly broad. The supervising judge denied the motion to quash. The newspapers took the position that the order denying its motion to quash was appealable as of right under the collateral order doctrine. The court held that the newspapers attempts to circumvent the subpoena by attempting to invoke the collateral order doctrine, by seeking certification of the supervising judge's order under Pa.R.A.P. 3331(a)(5), and by participating in an arrangement whereby it conditionally surrendered the subject computer hardware were unavailing, because only non-compliance on peril of contempt was the only response the newspapers had available to them. The court noted that other courts have refused similar invitations to employ the collateral order doctrine to circumvent the established course for challenging a subpoena.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order rejecting the newspapers' jurisdictional challenge, without prejudice, and vacated the orders requiring the surrender of the two computer hard drives. The Attorney General's petition for review was denied, and the order staying the Attorney Generals's obligation to comply with the disclosure order was vacated. The court also dismissed the newspapers' request for an exercise of the court's extraordinary jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner alleged a township's zoning and land use ordinances were invalid due to procedural defects that occurred during their adoption. Appellee zoning hearing board held the challenge was untimely under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5571(c)(5). The trial court affirmed, as did the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court. The landowner sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 909.1(a)(2) (53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10909.1(a)(2)) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code and &sect; 5571(c)(5) (42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5571(c)(5)) of the Pennsylvania Judicial Code both provided for a 30-day time limit on challenges to an ordinance. The owner's challenged was filed between five and seven years after enactment of the ordinance. However, the high court held that a challenge to the procedure in enacting an ordinance could not be dismissed summarily as time-barred because, if the procedural defect implicating constitutional due process concerns such as notice were proven, it would render the ordinance void ab initio. The effect of a finding that the ordinance was void ab initio meant it never became law because of its procedural defects; thus, any component of the challenge that contained a time bar, or intended effective date, was void for having never been properly passed. The board could not establish any reliance on the zoning ordinance; as such, this reason for straying from the void ab initio doctrine was absent. Therefore, the term containing the intended effective date restriction was void if the ordinance was never enacted properly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court reversed the decision of the intermediate appellate court and remanded the matter so that the owner could challenge solely those procedural defects that, if proven, could render the statute void ab initio.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the court held that the extensions of time contemplated by the Rule 600(G) and case law were inapplicable when Rule 600(E) was implicated. As such, the court held that Rule 600(E) contemplated an increase in the number of days of pretrial incarceration in excess of 180 based only upon the exclusions of time referenced in Rule 600(C), attributable to the defendant, and not upon extensions of time pursuant to Rule 600(G) for actions taken diligently by the Commonwealth.

This case implicated the free exercise of religion under the First Amendment, and the public policy of ensuring the best interests of children, 32 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5301. The state supreme court held that the Commonwealth's interest in promoting compliance with the statute criminalizing bigamy, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4301, was not an interest of the highest order that would supersede the interest of a parent in speaking to a child about a deeply held aspect of his faith. The state supreme court held that in order to prohibit a parent from advocating religious beliefs which, if acted upon, would constitute a crime, a court had to establish that advocating the prohibited conduct would jeopardize the physical or mental health or safety of the child, or have a potential for significant social burdens. Because such harm was not established in this case, the state supreme court held that there was no constitutional basis for the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a taxpayer and judges, filed three separate actions in the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania against appellees, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the state treasurer, and legislators, challenging the constitutionality of 2005 Pa. Laws 385, No. 72 (Act 72) and 2005 Pa. Laws 201, No. 44 (Act 44), which had been repealed by Act 72.  The present court assumed plenary jurisdiction over the matters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The acts involved compensation for judges, legislators, and officials. The court first held that Act 72 had reduced judicial compensation during judges' terms of office. Moreover, the exception in Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(a) did not apply because Act 72 did not diminish the pay of all salaried public officers of the Commonwealth. The remainder of Act 72's repeal of Act 44 was valid, however, because the act was severable under 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1925. Next, the court held that the adoption of Act 44 did not violate Pa. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, 3, and 4. The legislative unvouchered expense allowance provision, Act 44, &sect; 2, which amended 46 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1107, did violate Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 8, which proscribed a mid-term increase in legislative salary. The expense allowance did not bear a reasonable relationship to the actual expenses incurred by individual legislators. The court held that Act 44's nonseverability clause was ineffective, given the separation of powers concerns raised by the clause's inclusion in an act that included compensation provisions for the judiciary. Accordingly, the unconstitutional unvouchered expense provision was severable from the remainder of Act 44.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Act 72's repeal of Act 44 was unconstitutional insofar as it reduced judicial compensation; thus, it enjoined Act 72 in part. It declared that the provision of Act 44 respecting mid-term unvouchered expense allowances to legislators was unconstitutional. It ordered that judicial compensation be calculated under Act 44 and that judges be reimbursed for compensation they had lost under Act 72.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Contrary to defendant's contention, the supreme court held that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction. Among other things, defendant wrote a letter the day before the homicide in which defendant indicated that he planned to kill the victim, defendant's wife, and himself. In addition, there was no evidence that defendant was insane at the time of the offense, and defendant presented no testimony to support such a contention. Defendant challenged the death sentence imposed by the trial court, arguing that defendant was not competent to tenter a plea, to stipulate to the aggravating circumstance presented by the Commonwealth, or to direct counsel not to present evidence of any mitigating circumstance. The supreme court first concluded that the expert testimony supported the trial court's determination that defendant was competent to plead guilty; the expert concluded that defendant understood the nature and character of the charges and the potential consequences. In addition, imposition of the death penalty was not unconstitutional, as defendant offered no mitigating evidence to balance against the aggravating circumstance presented by the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee voters sought to set aside nomination papers filed by appellants, who were candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States. The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, having set aside the papers, entered two orders requiring appellants, pursuant to 25 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2937, to pay to the voters transcription and stenography costs in the amount of about $82,000. Appellants challenged the orders imposing costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth Court found that wide-ranging fraud and deception had occurred during appellants' signature gathering. It struck nearly two-thirds of the signatures, which included names of cartoon characters and randomly created names, and concluded that the signature-gathering process was the most deceitful and fraudulent exercise ever perpetrated upon it. The court first held that the first order had not disposed of the entire case and thus was not a final order under Pa. R. App. P. 341(d)(1) that was appealable under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 723(a). It therefore quashed the appeal of the first order. As for the second order, appellants were incorrect in arguing that 25 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2937 did not authorize an award of costs against a candidate whose nomination papers were set aside. The court had not distinguished between &quot;nomination papers&quot; and &quot;nomination petitions&quot; as claimed by appellants. Next, the Commonwealth Court had the authority, under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 764, to adjudicate disputes concerning elections, including the imposition of costs. Finally, the cost provision did not impinge upon any constitutional rights in a way that would warrant constitutional scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged the order of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which granted appellee maternal grandmother partial custody of the father's child, age eight at the time of the proceeding. The grandmother had filed for partial custody, pursuant to 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5311.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's mother, who was the father's wife and the grandmother's daughter, had died.

The grandmother and the child saw each other daily, with the grandmother providing the child's basic care and helping the child grieve her mother's illness and eventual death. After the mother died, the father refused to let the grandmother see the child. The court found no abuse of discretion with regard to the trial court's grant of partial custody to the grandmother in light of the father not letting the child see the grandmother but for three times in a year after the mother's death. The court also did not think that the father would allow the child and the grandmother to spend time together without a court order. The court held &sect; 5311 constitutional in that the compelling state interest of protecting the health and emotional welfare of a child was protected since &sect; 5311 was narrowly tailored to limit those who seek visitation or partial custody to only a very few situations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers filed a class action against appellees, a county and its board of property assessment appeals and review. They argued that the manner in which the county adjudicated appeals violated due process. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the taxpayers had an adequate remedy at law that precluded injunctive and declaratory relief. The Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania) affirmed. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court should not have dismissed the taxpayers' equitable claims. In order for a court to determine whether equity jurisdiction was proper in the face of an existing legal or statutory remedy, it had to determine if the legal remedy was adequate and complete. Here, the claimed procedural defect raised legal issues independent of the proper valuation of the properties that were the subject of the tax appeals. Moreover, the claimed defect arose from an alleged policy and practice directive setting forth rules that were on their face applicable to all assessment grievances. A multiplicity of individual de novo appeals to the trial court could be avoided through judicial review of the constitutionality of the board's procedures, and the general procedures of which the taxpayers complained could be facially tested against constitutional norms unaided by agency expertise. This same reasoning applied with respect to declaratory relief. A 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim, however, had been properly dismissed. Because equity jurisdiction existed, the taxpayers presently had an adequate state law remedy, removing a prerequisite to their ability to assert a &sect; 1983 suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Commonwealth Court's order upholding the dismissal of a &sect; 1983 claim. It reversed it in all other respects. The court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

The scope of review applicable to Act 111 grievance arbitration appeals was narrow certiorari review, which allowed the court to inquire into only four areas: the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, the regularity of the proceedings, whether the arbitrator had exceeded his powers, and whether there had been a deprivation of constitutional rights. Mootness was not an issue that implicated arbitral jurisdiction; rather, it posed a question of justiciability. There was no dispute here that the initial grievance fell within the arbitrator's jurisdiction. Accordingly, the question of mootness was for the arbitrator, and it did not fall within the court's scope of review. Therefore, the arbitrator's decision had to stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act mandated collective bargaining with the Commission's first-level supervisors. The lower court held that as there was no rational reason to treat first-level supervisors of the Commission differently from first-level supervisors employed by any other public employer, the Act was special legislation that violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32. The high court agreed. There was nothing distinctive about the Commission and its relationship with its first-level supervisors that separated it from all other public employers, thus requiring different treatment when it came to collective bargaining. The Act violated art. III, &sect; 32, because its narrow classification did not bear a reasonable relationship to its purpose. And as Act created a class with one member and did so in a fashion that made it impossible for another member to join the class, it was also unconstitutional per se.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's conviction arose from rape and stabbing death of a young woman, whose body was not found for several years. The inmate raised numerous contentions in his petition, some stemming from his 1991 trial and direct appeal therefrom, and others arising from the 1995 re-sentencing. The court agreed that the trial court erred during the 1995 re-sentencing hearing by precluding the inmate's proffered mitigation evidence of childhood abuse. The court found that the inmate's trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial court's ruling and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to appeal the decision of the trial court on re-sentencing. The court held that the childhood abuse evidence was admissible pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711(e)(8). The court noted that the trial court doubted whether the proposed evidence fit into one of the mitigating factors set forth in &sect; 9711 but erred in sustaining the Commonwealth's objection to the same. The court held that not only was such evidence relevant, its presence was a necessary component of a fair and complete sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from a killing spree spanning three days wherein he murdered four people, including his brother. The underlying charges in the case at bar involved the murder of a convenience store clerk. After murdering his brother, defendant and his girlfriend fled, with defendant shooting the convenience store clerk. Defendant took the victim's car but was eventually apprehended. Defendant raised numerous arguments of error on appeal, including 12 substantive issues, plus a claim that he did not receive independent appellate review, a generalized claim of ineffectiveness of counsel, and a claim of cumulative error. The court found no merit in any of defendant's contentions of error. Particularly, the court found no error with regard to the trial court's refusal to join the charges against defendant arising from the four murders since, though evidence of the murder of the brother was relevant and admissible in the trial at bar to show motive, intent, identity, and sequence of events as to the murder of the convenience store clerk, the crimes were distinct and not a part of the same sequence of events, therefore compulsory joinder was not required.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err in finding that the applicants had standing to seek partial custody or visitation under 23 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the board had denied the church's request for a tax exemption for two immediately adjacent parcels of land where its parking lot was located, the church appealed to the common pleas court. At a de novo hearing, the testimony indicated that limited off-street parking existed near the church. The common pleas court held that the parking lot was reasonably necessary for the occupancy of the church and thus was tax-exempt. The commonwealth court affirmed. On further appeal, the court affirmed. Under &sect; 204(a)(1) of the General County Assessment Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5020-204(a)(1), which had been enacted pursuant to Pa. Const. art. VII, &sect; 2(a), the court held that the parking lot was properly held to be tax-exempt as such property was necessary for the occupancy and enjoyment of the church based on the number of members who did not live within walking distance of the church. The court noted that, without the needed parking spaces, the church's ability to exist would be impeded. The court concluded that not all church parking lots would be entitled to tax-exempt status; proof of the parking lots' reasonable necessity to the existence of a church itself was needed.</SPAN></P>

The PCRA court did find that appellate counsel was ineffective but, because appellant failed to prove his underlying claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness, he was unable to prove his appellate counsel ineffectiveness claim.

III, &sect; 11. The health care providers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The health care providers filed a complaint to enjoin certain provisions of the General Appropriations Act of 2002 (2002 GAA) on the ground that it violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 11. Specifically, the health care providers asserted that 2002 GAA violated that constitutional provision because the 2002 GAA contained improper substantive language. The health care providers contended that 2002 GAA attempted to impose a default rate as the rate that the non-plan providers such as the health care providers had to accept for emergency services even though the Quality Healthcare Accountability and Protection Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 40, &sect;&sect; 991.2101-991.2193 (Act), required that providers be paid &quot;all reasonably necessary costs&quot; for the time period covered by 2002 GAA. The trial court found that the 2002 GAA did not contain improper substantive language. On appeal, the state supreme court cited Biles and found that to be constitutional, the language in an appropriations bill must not conflict with existing law. The state supreme court then found that the 2002 GAA did conflict with existing law, the Act, due to the differences in the language regarding the reimbursement rate requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth appealed the order of the Centre County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which held that lifetime probation imposed against non-sexually violent predators (SVP) offenders under Pennsylvania's Registration of Sexual Offenders Act (Megan's Law II), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9795.2 (2000) was unconstitutional. Appellee was convicted of indecent assault, a predicate crime under Megan's Law II.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because appellee was convicted of a predicate crime under Megan's Law II, he was required to register with the Pennsylvania State Police upon his release on parole and to verify any change of his registered address within 10 days. The Commonwealth charged appellee with two violations of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9795.2(a)(2)(i) for failing to inform the state police of his change in address. Appellee filed a pre-trial motion seeking dismissal of the charges on the basis that the penalty provision stated in &sect; 9795.2(d)(1) was unconstitutional. The trial court agreed with appellee, holding that the penalty provision of &sect; 9795.2(d)(1), which treated a violation as a third-degree felony with a statutory maximum penalty of seven years' incarceration, as increased incarceration. The court disagreed with the trial court's analysis and concluded that the trial court erred by applying the caselaw on the punitive nature of mandatory probation upon SVP offenders to the case at bar. In the instant case, appellee committed a predicate offense and was subjected to such punishment as attached by law to that offense upon conviction, a punishment that was clearly set forth in the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landfill operators challenged the order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which held that the regulations of appellee, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), adopting a harms/benefits test as part of the permitting process for waste disposal facilities was constitutional and authorized by statute. Appellee, a township Environmental Hearing Board (EHB), had upheld the DEP's grant of a conditional permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With regard to the application of one of the operators, the DEP found that the benefits outweighed the harms, in part, because the harms were only potentialities, whereas the benefits were actual, and granted the conditional permit. The permit included a condition that stated the failure to provide for all benefits described in the submissions would invalidate the harms/benefits analysis and violate the permit. The operator appealed to the EHB, which denied the operator's motion for summary judgment, upholding the validity of the harms/benefits test. On appeal, the operators asserted that the harms/benefits test was outside the authority granted to the DEP by the legislature. The court disagreed and held that the balancing test satisfied the DEP's requirement to establish a flexible and effective means to implement and enforce the provisions of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 6018.102(5) and Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 4000.102(b)(4).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sustained a work-related neck injury. She started to receive workers' compensation benefits. The employer then relocated its facility; as a consequence, the claimant was laid off. Following the layoff, the employer reinstated her workers' compensation benefits, which had been terminated when she had returned to work. Thereafter, she received a check from the employer for the net amount of severance pay due to her as a result of the employer's relocation. The payment was part of a severance agreement contained in an addendum to the most recent collective bargaining agreement that applied to her. The employer soon notified her that it would be offsetting the workers' compensation benefits by the severance pay she had received. The workers' compensation judge found that the employer, a privately-insured employer, could do so. An administrative appeals board affirmed. The Commonwealth Court disagreed and reversed. On further review, the state supreme court found both privately-insured and self-insured employers were entitled to the offset pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 71(a) and that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 71(a) did not violate her equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

As a result, he was charged with the misdemeanor offenses of disorderly conduct and failure of a disorderly person to disperse. He was also charged with the summary offense of criminal mischief. Following a trial, a jury convicted defendant of all three charges. The trial court then sentenced defendant to 30 days to 23-and-a-half months in prison. Although he could have chosen to remain free on bail, he opted to begin serving his sentence. Defendant then filed a post-sentence motion, which was denied. New counsel appeared on his behalf, and filed a brief challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and raising an issue of the effectiveness of defendant's trial counsel. The Superior Court found the evidence supported the convictions, affirmed the judgment of sentence, and found the ineffectiveness claim was barred by the general rule announced in Grant that an ineffectiveness claim should be deferred until a collateral review proceeding. On further review, the state supreme court declined to recognize a &quot;short sentence&quot; exception to the Grant rule because it concluded that such an exception would not be workable in most cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver had three DUI offenses, one of which occurred after the Interlock Law was enacted. The lower court held that it was an unlawfully retroactive application of the Interlock Law to enforce the interlock requirement on the basis of convictions which occurred before the statute was enacted. The court disagreed and held that the Department did not err in considering the driver's two prior DUI convictions as predicate offenses for purposes of determining his status as a recidivist offender under the Interlock Law. As such, the Department's notice to the driver that he was required to comply with the Interlock Law, or have his license suspended for an additional year, was lawful. As a result, the trial court erred in striking the interlock requirement and the lower court erred in affirming that order. The court noted that no statute was considered retroactive unless the Pennsylvania General Assembly so stated and that no substantial right of the driver was impaired in that driving was a privilege and the law granted the equivalent to a probationary license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped at a driving under the influence checkpoint. Defendant filed an unsuccessful motion to suppress, claiming that sobriety checkpoints were per se violative of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Defendant provided statistical data comparing sobriety checkpoint efficiency with roving patrols, arguing that the statistics demonstrated that there existed a practical alternative to roadblocks. Because of the existence of a practical alternative, defendant argued that the three-factor balancing test previously applied in roadblock cases was inapplicable. Under this test, a court weighed the gravity of the public concerns served by the seizure, the degree to which the seizure advanced the public interest, and the severity of the interference with individual liberty. The reviewing court reaffirmed the use of the three-pronged balancing test in such cases. Driving under the influence roadblocks were not so ineffective as to be constitutionally unreasonable under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. While defendant's statistics may have shown that roving patrols required less man hours than roadblocks, the statistics did not take into account the deterrent effect of roadblocks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to burglary, aggravated assault, theft, and resisting arrest, and was sentenced. The Commonwealth appealed the order of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which vacated and remanded the trial court's judgment of sentence. The state supreme court granted allocatur to consider whether the recidivist philosophy influenced or controlled the interpretation of the three strikes law, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9714.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was whether the three strikes law reflected a &quot;recidivist philosophy&quot; and should be construed to allow for heightened punishment for repeat offenders only where their convictions for crimes of violence, and corresponding terms of incarceration, were sequential and each was separated by an intervening opportunity to reform. Specifically, defendant argued that it would be absurd to treat him as a third-time offender where he had never been sentenced as a second-time offender. The state supreme court found that at the time of defendant's concurrent sentencing for his three prior burglaries in 1997, he was not sentenced as a second-time offender. The anomaly of defendant's situation was that while he had never been sentenced as a second-strike offender, application of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;9714(a)(2) would subject him to sentencing as a third-strike offender. The legislative purpose of the three strikes law was to punish multiple offenders consistently with the recidivist philosophy. Thus, because 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9714(a)(2) was ambiguously silent regarding whether predicate convictions had to be sequential, that ambiguity was construed in defendant's favor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court vacated the order of the superior court and remanded the matter to the trial court for re-sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court found that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to develop and introduce evidence warranting a voluntary manslaughter charge and verdict and for failing to argue on direct appeal that the prisoner was entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter. The prisoner's death sentence was not based upon an improper application of the perpetration of a felony aggravating circumstance, and counsel was not ineffective in failing to litigate claims about that aggravator. Trial counsel's failure to investigate and present at sentencing the evidence of the prisoner's increasingly paranoid behavior, paranoid schizophrenia, family dysfunction and abuse, diminished capacity, and emotional trauma at the time of the offenses did not deprive him of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. The proportionality review performed by the court was not constitutionally defective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed an action seeking declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, claiming that the procedures employed in enacting the Gaming Act, 4 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1101 et seq., violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 1, 3, 4, 6, 10. Respondents filed preliminary objections in the nature of the demurrer, and the parties agreed to proceed to final merits resolution. The court determined that it had original and exclusive jurisdiction to resolve the constitutional challenges raised pursuant to 4 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1904. Because the legislative petitioners had standing and because all petitioners collectively asserted the various challenges, the court did not need to determine whether the non-legislative petitioners had standing. The court found that there was a single unifying subject, which was the regulation of gaming; however, certain provisions of the Gaming Act violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3 by providing for outright distributions, while other provisions permissibly provided for subsequent appropriation through a subsequently enacted budget. Those provisions that were held unconstitutional were severed from the rest of the Gaming Act, which was sustained by the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioners' request for relief by striking certain provisions of the Gaming Act pursuant to the Gaming Act's severability provision but found that the remainder of the Gaming Act withstood petitioners' constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was black, argued with a white worker, retrieved a gun from his apartment, and went looking for the worker. He did not find him, but fatally shot the worker's white coworker; he then shot four other white men whom he selected at random, killing two and maiming two. The supreme court found that the evidence supported the murder convictions. As defendant's own expert testified that defendant had the capacity to form a specific intent to kill, an instruction on third-degree murder or diminished capacity was not required. Defendant refused to cooperate with the State's expert; defendant argued, and the trial court agreed, that the expert had sufficient access to defendant to render an opinion. Therefore, defendant's challenge to the admissibility of the expert's opinion based on the insufficiency of his examination failed. The victim impact evidence was not excessive as the number of victims necessitated the large number of witnesses. Defendant's Atkins claim had to be raised in a postconviction motion as the record was not sufficiently developed. The sentence of death was not the product of any arbitrary factor, and the evidence supported the finding of one aggravator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences of death and dismissed his claim of death penalty ineligibility based upon mental retardation without prejudice to his right to raise that claim on collateral review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved appellants' 1997 alleged liability for taxes imposed pursuant to the Public Utility Realty Tax Act (PURTA), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 8101-A through 8108-A (1997). There was a $ 71 million shortfall in revenue in 1997 and how the Department reconciled that shortfall formed the basis of the dispute. The Department sent notices to appellants indicating their individual supplementary tax (suptax) liability, an assessment to make up for the shortfall, was due to the Department within 45 days or else the utility was subject to interest and penalty. Appellants filed suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and asserted that the notices were invoices that started the collection process for the suptax, and that the Department was to issue individual settlements of the 1997 suptax before sending the notices and requiring payment. The court disagreed and held that PURTA did not require the Department to issue settlement as a precursor to delivering the notices prescribed by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 8104-A (1997). The court noted that had the Pennsylvania legislature intended to provide for a pre-deprivation process, it would have done so within PURTA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Commonwealth appealed the order from the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which granted defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus on grounds that statute under which he was charged, 18 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three girls, an 18-year-old, 17-year-old, and a 15-year-old, decided to consume the drug Ecstasy at an all-day concert. They bought three pills, which each contained a double dose of Ecstasy, from defendant, who was 19 years old. The 17-year-old girl advised her friends to only take one-half of the pill because they had never taken Ecstasy. The 17-year-old took the whole pill. The other two girls took only half of their pills, but later decided to take the rest. The 15-year-old became ill and later died from an Ecstasy overdose. Defendant was charged with drug delivery resulting in death, but the trial court dismissed the charges against him. On appeal, the court affirmed, first finding that &sect; 2506 was not unconstitutionally vague because the default culpability provision found at 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 302(c) provided a definite culpability element, malice. However, the court held that defendant remained entitled to relief because the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence of malice aforethought to establish a prima facie case against him, noting that simply because he delivered an illegal drug that was potentially harmful to another did not rise to the level of malice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two game officers issued defendant a citation for violating 34 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 904, which required a person to produce identification upon demand of a game officer. The Commonwealth appealed the order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which held 34 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 904&nbsp;unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the Commonwealth argued that if a law could be valid under any possible circumstance, the state supreme court could not invalidate it. It also argued that hunting was a closely regulated industry; thus, all people coming in contact with game officers had reduced Fourth Amendment protections from searches. The state supreme court concluded that the statute was overly broad. The game officers did not have any reasonable suspicion that defendant was involved in contemporaneous criminal conduct. There was no crime in progress or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity afoot. The game officers were simply investigating a four-month-old complaint. Defendant was never detained by the game officers; he walked away from the encounter. The statute's impermissible applications were substantial, as it purported to give game officers the power to demand identification without reason, so long as the officer was in the performance of any duty. This power clearly reached a substantial amount of protected conduct as it infringed upon a citizen's right to be free from demands from law enforcement officials who had no articulable suspicion of wrongdoing by the citizen whatsoever.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee inmates sued appellant Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Corrections over the Department's refusal to deliver certain magazines to them. The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court rejected challenges to Pennsylvania's Obscenity Law, a Department rule banning obscene materials, and the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), except for a section of the PLRA involving filing fees payable in prison conditions suits. Both sides appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates alleged that a Department regulation barring their access to allegedly obscene materials violated their right to free speech under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and that portions of the Pennsylvania Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 6601-6608, and of the Obscenity Law were unconstitutional. The supreme court agreed with the lower court that &sect; 6602(a)-(c) of the PLRA, dealing with inmates' payment of filing fees, abrogated the supreme court's rule-making authority granted by Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 10(c) because the statute conflicted with Pa. R. Civ. P. 240(f). The lower court erred in finding that &sect; 6605(a) of the PLRA, allowing the automatic dissolution of injunctions in prison condition suits, was constitutional as &sect; 6605(a) conflicted with Pa. R. Civ. P. 1531. Other challenged provisions of the PLRA were substantive, not procedural, so Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 10(c) did not apply. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5903(a)(7)-(9) of the Obscenity Law was constitutional since jurors determined if materials were &quot;obscene&quot; and inmates lacked the same level of constitutional protections as non-inmates. The Department's regulation was reasonable under the Turner standard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court properly found unconstitutional PLRA provisions regarding payment of filing fees in prison conditions litigation. However, it erred in ruling that the portion of the PLRA that provided for the automatic dissolution of a preliminary injunction was constitutional. Its other rulings were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant electric generation suppliers (EGSs) appealed from an order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which granted summary relief to appellee Public Utility Commission Fiscal Office and ruled that the EGSs could be considered public utilities for the limited purposes of 66 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue in the appeal was whether the Fiscal Office could assess the EGSs for the administrative expenses of the Public Utility Commission, the Office of Consumer Advocate (OCA), and the Office of Small Business Advocate (OSBA).

Stat. tit. 73, &sect; 399.45 applied only to &quot;public utilities,&quot; and EGSs were not public utilities. The court agreed. The plain language of 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 102 indicated that EGSs were not to be considered public utilities except for the limited purposes of 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 2809, 2810. No mention was made of 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 510, and thus, EGSs were not to be considered public utilities for purposes of &sect; 510 assessments. As the assessments for the OCA and the OSBA also applied only to public utilities, the Fiscal Offices assessments under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 71, &sect; 309-4.1 and Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 73, &sect; 399.45, were also improper.</SPAN></P>

In his appeal, the inmate made several arguments, including the argument that application of the 1996 amendment to the inmate violated the Ex Post Facto Clauses of both the U.S. and Pennsylvania Constitutions. The court held that: (1) the lower court should have reviewed the merits of the inmate's ex post facto claim but remand was not necessary; (2) under the federal decisions in Garner and Morales, the inmate's ex post facto claim had merit only if he showed that application of the 1996 amendment posed a significant risk of an increase in the inmate's punishment; (3) the inmate failed to adduce such evidence; and (4) mandamus could not be used to question the Board's reliance on an Immigration and Naturalization Service detainer in the denial of parole, or the Board's imposition of back-time in excess of the maximum presumptive range for the inmate's parole violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County (Pennsylvania), which imposed a sentence of death following defendant's conviction on two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of criminal attempt to commit murder, one count of rape, one count of criminal trespass, and one count of theft.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to multiple crimes after he bound, raped, and killed his cousin's wife, wounded his cousin, killed his cousin's neighbor, and wounded the neighbor's wife in a senseless crime spree. He was sentenced to death. On appeal, he argued that precedent and due process under Penn. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 did not allow a court to accept a guilty plea to first-degree murder. He also argued that counsel was ineffective for failing to request a degree of guilt hearing and for failing to seek suppression of his confession. The court found that the argument that a first-degree guilty plea could not be accepted permeated defendant's claims, but lacked any merit. Defendant's argument was based on a statement of dicta in one case and isolated lower court cases that acknowledged that line of dicta, which was not precedential authority. Since counsel considered a degree hearing, but rejected it since the prosecutor indicated he would seek the death penalty regardless, counsel was not ineffective. Moreover, appellate counsel conceded that no record evidence existed on the tactics used to obtain defendant's confession, so the presumption favoring counsel's effectiveness applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant and others were robbing a bank, he fatally shot a police officer. The supreme court held that eyewitness testimony identifying defendant as the one brandishing the murder weapon, coupled with ballistic and forensic evidence, was sufficient to prove he possessed the requisite specific intent and unlawfully killed the officer with deliberation. As the trial court did not hold an evidentiary hearing on defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, those claims could not be reviewed on appeal but had to be raised during the collateral review of his conviction. The &quot;victim impact testimony&quot; instruction mirrored the language of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711(d)(7) and was proper. The death penalty statute did not violate Ring or Apprendi. Under &sect; 9711(c)(1)(iii), jurors had to determine if aggravating factors existed and outweighed any mitigating factors, and Apprendi did not impose the &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; standard to the weighing of these factors. The evidence established three aggravators: (1) a peace officer was killed performing her duties (2) during the perpetration of a felony, and (3) defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, finding no merit to defendant's claims of ineffectiveness of both trial and appellate counsel. The court found that defendant had not carried his Pierce burden in relation to the underlying claim of trial counsel's ineffectiveness, and that based on the information in the pre-sentencing evaluation, defendant's alleged mental illness surfaced after his incarceration; the evaluation gave no indication of any mental impairment at the time of the murder.

C.S. &sect;&sect; 9541-9546 (PCRA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's claims implicated the pre-trial, guilt and penalty proceedings, and post-verdict/appeal stages. The supreme court did not believe the change in the burden of proof as to competency under Cooper constituted a watershed rule that seriously undermined the reliability of the trial's outcome and altered bedrock procedural elements. Absent an offer from appellant explaining why the maintenance of his medication was involuntary, the court would not assume counsel was ineffective for failing to object. Prior counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the prosecutor's cross-examination of a court-appointed psychologist. Finally, appellant argued that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate, develop, and present substantial mitigation, in particular, evidence concerning mental illness, brain injury, and his traumatic childhood. The supreme court found a genuine factual dispute existed with respect to counsel's awareness of the proof, nature and extent of his investigation, and whether the decision to not present certain evidence was founded upon reasonable strategic concerns. Thus, an evidentiary hearing was required to allow appellant to develop this claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the PCRA court was vacated and the matter was remanded for additional proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a decision from the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, which reversed a trial court's decision that ordinances enacted regarding life partners were valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted several ordinances relating to life partners. Appellee individuals challenged the ordinances as invalid. A trial court ruled in favor of the city, but the appellate court reversed. The city then sought review. On appeal, the court determined that the city did not exceed its powers by enacting Philadelphia, Pa., Code &sect; 9-1106(2)(a). Under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect;&sect; 13131, 13133, the city did not exercise any power that was applicable to every part of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Moreover, the designation of life partnership as a marital status did not mean that the city had legislated in the area of marriage because the legislation did not imbue life partners with the myriad of rights and responsibilities that was imparted on married people. However, the anti-discrimination provisions in Philadelphia, Pa., Code &sect;&sect; 9-1103, 9-1105, invited people that were not residents to register as life partners. As such, the legislation was an ultra vires act. Finally, the tax exemption in Philadelphia, Pa., Code &sect; 19-1405(6) violated Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 because life partners did not share the characteristics of the other individuals previously allowed the exemption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the appellate court's decision that invalidated the anti-discrimination protection for life partners and the ordinance making certain real estate transactions tax exempt. However, the court reversed the appellate court's decision insofar that it invalidated the city's decision to extend employee benefits to life partners.</SPAN></P>

The petition was denied and he appealed. The court found, first, that defendant failed to plead some claims in his PCRA petition, so those claims were waived. Second, the alleged hearsay evidence was admissible where it was a prior consistent identification or where it was used to rehabilitate a witness and where the witnesses were available for cross-examination. Third, under the law applicable to defendant, the jury instructions were constitutional. Fourth, defendant failed to show that counsel was ineffective in allowing him to waive investigation into mitigating circumstances.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was found guilty of, inter alia, first degree murder and was sentenced to death. Subsequently, the Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division of Luzerne County (Pennsylvania), vacated the inmate's death sentence and granted him a new penalty hearing under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9541-9546. The Commonwealth appealed. The inmate cross-appealed from the denial of his remaining claims for relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the PCRA hearing, the inmate's mother, sister, and ex-wife testified concerning the inmate's traumatic and abusive childhood, including witnessing his father slash his mother's throat. While that evidence might or might not be perceived as mitigating evidence, the reason it was not provided at the sentencing hearing was not strategic; thus, the supreme court agreed with the PCRA court's determination that the jury should have been given the evidence. Also, the witnesses further testified they would have testified at the penalty phase. Thus, the record from the PCRA hearing revealed that (1) mitigating evidence witnesses existed; (2) they were available and would have testified at the penalty phase; (3) trial counsel knew of their existence; and (4) the absence of their testimony prejudiced the inmate. The supreme court found that presenting no mitigating evidence, when such evidence was arguably available, was not a reasonable tactic in the inmate's case where without the evidence, the only chance for a life sentence was if the jury did not find either of two aggravating circumstances proven. Thus, the PCRA court properly ruled a new penalty hearing was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the PCRA court's order granting the inmate a new penalty hearing and affirmed the denial of his request for relief on his remaining issues.

The state supreme court concluded that 75 Pa. Cons.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city and its mayor, sought review of the order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania) that dismissed their amended complaint challenging the legality of certain amendments to Pennsylvania's Parking Authority Law after sustaining the preliminary objections filed by appellees, the Governor of Pennsylvania and the city parking authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Parking Authority was created by city ordinance adopted under the Parking Authority Law. As amended in 1982, the Parking Authority Law authorized cities to delegate to their parking authorities responsibility for certain parking functions. In 2001, the Governor signed into law 2001 Pa. Laws 287, No. 22 (Act 22), which codified the Parking Authority Law at 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5501-5517, and amended the Parking Authority Law by adding a special provision, applicable only to Philadelphia, supplanting the mayor's appointment powers over the parking authority's governing board by giving such authority to the Governor. The provision also required the reconstituted parking authority to transfer some earnings to the Philadelphia School District. Appellants unsuccessfully challenged the legality of the amendments. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the trial court properly held that the home rule doctrine, which allowed for autonomous self-governance relative to municipal affairs, did not apply with respect to the authority, because the authority was not an agency of a municipal government, but rather, was an agent of the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant construction company challenged an order from the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed an order holding that appellee township could impose a business privilege tax (BPT) under Upper Moreland, Pa., Business Privilege Tax Ordinance &sect; 1.04, on 100 percent of the company's gross receipts for work that was mostly conducted out-of-state without violating the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company filed tax returns that reported taxable gross receipts only for that portion of its gross receipts that were attributable to its business activity within the township. It sought a refund for past overpayments. The township denied the refund and, instead, claimed that the company was responsible for additional BPT for prior years, plus interest and penalties. The company filed a civil action to recover the refund. The township counterclaimed for the additional tax. On cross-motions for summary judgment, a trial court awarded the township its requested recovery. On appeal from an affirmance of that order, the company argued that the Ordinance allowed a BPT on activities performed outside the township, which was beyond the township's authority under the Local Tax Enabling Act (LTEA), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect;&sect; 6901-6924, and which violated the Commerce Clause. The court found that the BPT was authorized under the LTEA. However, since it was undisputed that the vast majority of the company's business occurred out-of-state and since the BPT was not fairly apportioned or rationally related to the company's business in the township, the BPT violated the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the decision holding that the township's taxation of receipts generated from the company's out-of-state work did not violate the Commerce Clause, but it otherwise affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which convicted defendant of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance and conspiracy.

Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 780-115.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the sentencing enhancement was applied, the trial court sentenced defendant, in absentia, to 10 to 20 years' imprisonment for the possession charge, which was twice the statutory maximum otherwise authorized, as well as imposed twice the statutory maximum sentence for the conspiracy conviction. Defendant argued on appeal that &sect; 780-115(a) violated due process under the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions, because it raised the maximum penalty for recidivist drug offenders, making the prior convictions an element of the second or subsequent offense, without requiring they be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before a jury. The court held that &sect; 780-115(a) was constitutional. The court found that although the fact of defendant's prior drug convictions was not required to be pled in the information charging him with possession, the information notified him of the Commonwealth's intent to seek the enhancement. Further, defendant's prior drug convictions appeared in the file and presentence report available to the sentencing court. The existence of the prior convictions was capable of objective proof, which did not require submission to a jury for determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought a position with the school district, but was not selected. His complaint was based on the Veterans' Preference Act, 51 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7101-7109. On appeal, the issue was whether the board's letter indicating that it would be hiring another candidate constituted an adjudication, because if it did, the complaint was untimely and the trial court correctly dismissed it. The state supreme court concluded that the letter was informatory, not adjudicatory. Because the applicant was able to advance only to level four of the five-step hiring process, he was not among the final applicants under consideration, and the preference had not yet ripened. The applicants remaining after the fourth stage were those considered qualified for the teaching position. Therefore, the applicant was not among the most qualified candidates for the position, and the appellate court erred in concluding that the preference had become a constitutionally protected property interest. The applicant did not have a property interest in the teaching position he sought, but in the veteran's preference that only ripened when he could establish the requisite qualifications for the position.</SPAN></P>

The court held that claims that were not raised in the PCRA petition were waived. The inmate did not show that the PCRA court improperly refused to hold a hearing on the issues other than his incompetency at trial. As to the incompetency claim, the PCRA court did not abuse its discretion when it held a retrospective hearing to determine the inmate's competence at trial, which was three years before the PCRA proceedings, or by determining that the inmate did not establish that he was incompetent at the time of trial. The inmate did not establish any of his claims that his guilt and penalty phase counsel were ineffective.

In order to qualify as a &quot;single housekeeping unit,&quot; a group of individuals in a single household had to not only function as a family within that household, but in addition, the composition of the group had to be sufficiently stable and permanent so as not to be fairly characterized as purely transient. The entire premise of the halfway house was to lodge its residents for only so long as was necessary to prepare them to return to their own families.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The search of the residence was conducted pursuant to a warrant, but both the inmate and the co-defendant filed suppression motions based on the initial warrantless entry into the home while the warrant was being obtained.

On the other hand, the co-defendant was granted leave to appeal and her appeal resulted in relief from her conviction, based in part on the illegal initial entry into the home. In his PCRA petition, the inmate asserted that his Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 rights were violated by the disparate treatment he received on direct review. The court agreed, holding that (1) both the inmate and the co-defendant were identically situated during the course of the criminal trial and direct appeal proceedings; (2) there was no basis for the difference in treatment afforded the inmate on direct appeal; (3) res judicata did not prohibit him from raising the illegal search issue; and (4) the inmate was entitled to relief under the holding in the co-defendant's case, and under the specific circumstances of the case, collateral review was available.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a negotiated, counseled plea of nolo contendere to three counts of murder. He was sentenced to three consecutive terms of life imprisonment by the trial court. Defendant did not file post-sentence motions and did not pursue a direct appeal. Defendant later filed a petition for post conviction relief. The motion court dismissed the petition. The Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the dismissal. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed three people, wounded four people, and tried to commit suicide by shooting himself in the head. However, defendant survived his attempted suicide. Defense counsel negotiated a plea because he said defendant was unable to discuss the facts of his case in a sensible way. After conducting a waiver colloquy with defendant, the trial court accepted the plea. Defendant's post conviction petition was dismissed as time-barred under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9545 of the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9541 et seq. Defendant claimed that his alleged mental incapacity rendered the facts upon which his substantive PCRA claims would be based unknowable to him until the point at which he became competent, and thus qualified him for review under the PCRA's after-discovered evidence exception to the PCRA time-bar. The supreme court found that in light of the language of the exception, defendant should have been afforded an opportunity to attempt to prove that he was incompetent at the relevant times and that such incompetence qualified under the after-discovered evidence exception to the PCRA time-bar.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated, and the matter was remanded to the motion court for a limited hearing addressing defendant's claims: (1) that he was and remained incompetent throughout the period during which his right to file a post conviction petition lapsed; and (2) that his then-current petition was timely filed within 60 days of his becoming sufficiently competent to ascertain the facts upon which his underlying claims were predicated.</SPAN></P>

Trial Court Judge: J. Michael Williamson, Judge.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth brought a direct appeal pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 722(7) from an order of the Court of Common Plea of Clinton County, Civil Division (Pennsylvania), that sustained petitioner serial drunk driver's appeal from respondent Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's revocation of his license pursuant to conditions set by Act 63, former Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7001-7003, and holding that act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By the time the Commonwealth appealed the trial court's invalidation of Act 63, the high court had already invalidated it on separation of powers grounds. After determining that the trial court had jurisdiction to review the department's action under both 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1550(a) and 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 933(a)(1)(ii), so that its own assumption of appellate jurisdiction was proper, the high court proceeded to the merits of the equal protection challenge. The driver had argued that because an ignition interlock system, on which early reinstatement of his driving privileges was conditioned, cost more than a thousand dollars to install, the statute impermissibly discriminated on the basis of wealth. The court held, first, that under federal and Pennsylvania equal protection case law, financial need, by itself, did not necessarily identify a suspect class, and that driving was not, in any case, a right. Therefore, it looked only to whether the law had a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental objective. Prevention of drunk driving was obviously a legitimate objective, so the statute survived the challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the order based on separation of powers grounds and reversed the portion based on equal protection. It transferred the appeal to an intermediate court for determination of additional issues raised by the Commonwealth but insufficiently argued for decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife were public figures. The wife led a crusade against &quot;gangsta rap&quot; music. She sued a gangsta rap artist and recording companies that marketed such music after the artist made recordings with lyrics about the wife. The husband and wife listed loss of consortium as one of their damages. The husband and wife alleged that the newspapers printed defamatory articles about the lawsuit and held them up to public ridicule, as they reported that the husband and wife sought damages because the lyrics diminished their sex life. The husband and wife claimed their attorney told newspapers that the loss of consortium claim did not include a claim for loss of sexual relations. On appeal, the court found the complaint, albeit barely, alleged that the statements were capable of a defamatory meaning. However, because the pleading was impermissibly vague, the supreme court dismissed it with leave to replead if the husband and wife were able to allege, in good faith, that their attorney unequivocally told the newspapers before the articles were printed that the husband and wife were not seeking damages for loss of sexual relations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the appellate court was affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the complaint was dismissed. The husband and wife were granted leave to replead only to the extent they were able to allege that, before the newspapers printed the articles, the husband and wife or their representative unequivocally told the newspapers that their loss of consortium claim did not include a claim that the lyrics damaged their sex lives.</SPAN></P>

He argued that in allowing write-ins, the intermediate court had improperly construed &sect; 1112-A(b)(3) (Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 25, &sect; 3031.12(b)(3)) of the Pennsylvania Election Code, Pa. Stat.

When the winner and loser were tied in the initial count of optical scan ballots used in the election, and a recount was conducted, the winner appeared to have won if a number of write-ins were counted. The trial court held that under &sect; 112-A(b)(3), those votes were invalid. The high court agreed with the intermediate court that since election laws were to be liberally construed to safeguard voting rights and since there was no question as to the voters' intent and since there was no possibility of fraud or accidental double-voting where an optically scanned ballot had to be checked for stray marks in any case, it was proper to count the votes. Moreover, the statute did not indicate that such write-ins were invalid, only that they were not done in the proper way.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a worker suffering from asbestos-related disease and his wife, appealed from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) that granted a global motion, by defendant former merger partner of an asbestos manufacturer, for summary judgment based on a limitation of successor liability enacted by 15 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1929.1. They argued that the statute as applied to them violated Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted &sect; 1929.1 in an effort to provide some protection to innocent acquirers of companies that were eventually held liable as asbestos manufacturers. The worker and his wife sued many manufacturers of asbestos as possible contributors of asbestos to which he had been exposed at work. The merger partner, for only a few weeks, owned that division of a company it acquired that had at one time manufactured asbestos products. Because of the seriousness of the constitutional challenge and the legislation, the high court exercised extraordinary jurisdiction to grant direct review. The Remedies Clause of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 operated to protect litigants against retrospective abolition of claims that had already accrued as causes of action. It applied when the effect of retrospective application of legislation eliminated a remedy altogether. Therefore, while the court did not invalidate the whole statute, it held that it could not be applied to cut off the rights of the worker, whose claim against the merger partner had accrued, even though he still had claims against other manufacturers. Each of his claims was separate, and required a remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of transportation (DOT) sought review from the order of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the order of the lower court denying its motion to quash appellee's subpoena duces tecum and directing the DOT to produce the items that were covered by 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3754(b). The trial court had stayed its order and certified the question of the applicability of the statutory privilege for interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the statutory privilege set forth in &sect; 3754(b) justified the DOT in moving to quash appellee's subpoena, which sought the DOT's accident reports, safety studies, and accident investigations for the purpose of preparing his defense in a criminal prosecution. The lower courts construed the privilege not according to its plain language, but in a narrower fashion dictated by their view of the statute's alleged purpose. So construed, the lower courts held that the statutory privilege did not extend to the request made by appellee. The instant court held the DOT's documents were privileged under &sect; 3754(b) and the statute, so applied, was not unconstitutional. To allow discovery of these accident reports and studies in collateral matters would have directly countered the statutory mandate of promoting a safe and efficient highway system by providing the DOT with unbiased and accurate information unfettered by involving its employees and consultants in collateral legal actions or other proceedings of any type. Such restriction was an appropriate manner designed to achieve important governmental objectives: a safe and efficient highway system in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a person convicted of larceny, could not purchase a firearm due to &sect; 922 (18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 922) of the Federal Gun Control Act (GCA), according to appellee, the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP). He challenged the denial administratively, and before the Commonwealth Court. He appealed the Commonwealth Court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1962, appellant was convicted of larceny for stealing a case of beer. During an attempt to buy a rifle, a PSP background check revealed the conviction, and his purchase was denied. Appellant sought a hearing because a larceny conviction was not a disqualifying offense under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6105(b). Before the hearing, the PSP informed him the real basis for his denial was &sect; 922 of the GCA. An administrative law judge (ALJ) affirmed the denial under the GCA and the Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act. The lower court deemed all of appellant's constitutional claims, with the exception of the ex post facto issue, to be waived. The instant court considered whether &sect; 922(g) was an ex post facto law and whether the lower court erred in not addressing all of appellant's constitutional claims. The PSP's waiver argument overlooked two inconvenient facts: the distinction between facial and &quot;as applied&quot; challenges under 2 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 703(a) was not expressly established at the time of appellant's hearing, and the ALJ specifically disclaimed-having jurisdiction to hear any of appellant's constitutional claims. Thus, the court could not apply the waiver rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The case was remanded to the Commonwealth Court with directions to remand to the ALJ for further proceedings. Appellant was given the opportunity on remand to present his other constitutional challenges to the application of the GCA to his case.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 1, but it was not a fundamental right; thus, the criminal records chapter was subject to a rational basis test; (2) although the goal of protecting the Commonwealth's vulnerable citizens from those deemed incapable of safely providing for them was legitimate, there was no basis to distinguish between caretakers with convictions who had held a job for a year before the effective date of the chapter, from those who had not; and (3) the criminal records chapter, particularly with regard to its application to the employees, did not bear a real and substantial relationship to the Commonwealth's interest in protecting the elderly, disabled, and infirm from victimization.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the commonwealth court's decision, although for different reasons, and held that the chapter was unconstitutional because it infringed on the employees' rights to pursue an occupation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property, containing about 135 acres, was open space located adjacent to the region's primary highways and to one of the most intensely developed commercial areas in the region. The zoning board rejected the purchaser's challenge on the ground that the difference in zoning treatment between the agriculturally designated property and the adjoining properties, all of which were designated for intense, commercial development, was justified by, inter alia, the road frontage, adjoining and existing uses, and the large size of the property. Reversing, the court held that the agricultural designation, which was designed to &quot;freeze&quot; the property's substantially undeveloped state in order to serve the public interest as &quot;green space,&quot; constituted unlawful &quot;reverse spot zoning&quot; because the large size of the tract was not determinative and, apart from a bare assertion that it was so, neither the zoning board nor the courts below offered authority to support the proposition that the location of the highways made agricultural zoning appropriate for the property while the properties on the opposite side of the same roadways were appropriately zoned for intense, commercial use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which ruled that the statutory procedure for determining whether defendant was a sexually violent predator under the Registration of Sexual Offenders Act (Megan's Law), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9791-9799.7, was inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered pleas on several misdemeanor-one indecent assault charges, a predicate offense triggering a Megan's Law assessment of whether defendant was a sexually violent predator. The trial court refused to order the assessment, holding that the Law used an improper evidentiary standard. The question before the supreme court was whether sexually violent predator status had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The supreme court ruled that it did not and that the &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; standard outlined in Megan's Law was an appropriate standard of proof. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt was too burdensome in view of the Commonwealth's need to protect its citizens from individuals who had committed a predicate offense and who additionally suffered from a volitional impairment making them likely to recidivate. That standard was properly reserved for criminal prosecutions. And, although an individual adjudicated as a sexually violent predator might suffer a substantial imposition upon his liberty interests, the harm to the public of erroneous exclusion of a sexually violent predator supported the clear and convincing standard and was consistent with due process.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 53, &sect; 65503 conflicted with Pa. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7, and that it was thus unconstitutional. The supreme court found the fact that &sect; 7 did not explicitly spell out the manner in which &sect; 7 was to be invoked did not make the method of removal unclear. Moreover, even if the constitutional removal method was not as practical as the one provided for in Pa. Stat. tit. 53, &sect; 65503, the supreme court could not disregard a controlling constitutional provision. Although legislation that regulated the manner and causes of removal of township supervisors existed prior to the 1874 Pennsylvania Constitution, this fact did not make &sect; 65503 constitutional, as it was not until after the 1874 Pennsylvania Constitution that there was legislation allowing for the removal of township supervisors for neglect in performing duties. As such, the supreme court held that the provisions of &sect; 65503 were violative of Pa. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

Affirming, the court held that: (1) the putative father was barred from asserting paternity by the doctrine of judicial estoppel because he did not adequately explain the contradiction between his judicial statements and his denial of paternity was successfully asserted in the child support action; (2) the needs of the child, which was the court's paramount concern, favored her adoption by her mother's husband who had supported her for 10 years; (3) the putative father's assertion of paternity was also barred by the doctrine of equitable estoppel; and (4) although the mother made inconsistent statements, the paternity was actually unknown, and there was no evidence that the mother and her husband's failure to obtain the consent of the putative father constituted &quot;fraud or deceit,&quot; so as to bar judicial estoppel for violation of the clean hands doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The biosolids processor was a New Jersey corporation that obtained a beneficial use order approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, allowing it to spread its biosolids on agricultural lands in Pennsylvania. The approval was suspended and the processor was given permission to conduct demonstration projects, which it intended to do within the township upon proper approvals being obtained. The township passed Ordinance 2001-01, which attempted to locally regulate land application of sludge-derived products. The processor contended that the ordinance was illegal because the matter was preempted by the Solid Waste Management Act (SWMA), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect;&sect; 6018.101-.1003. Initially, the court determined that the processor had standing because its interest was direct, substantial, and immediate. The court found that while the SWMA did not preempt local regulation in that area, the township had exceeded its authority by imposing standards, such as imposing road user charges, that went beyond those necessary to protect the general welfare. Such excess power was not within the grant of powers to the township by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the order to the extent that the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the processor, which in effect permanently enjoined enforcement of certain portions of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The farm owners' land was located in an agricultural security area as defined by the Pennsylvania Agricultural Area Security Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 901 et seq. The farm owners argued that the private road could not be opened without the approval of the Pennsylvania Agricultural Lands Condemnation Approval Board. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court found that the Board did not need to grant approval prior to the opening of a private road on land within an agricultural security area. The supreme court found that the opening of a private road did not constitute an exercise of eminent domain power under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 913, as the public was not to be the primary beneficiary of the private road. As a result, the opening of the private road pursuant to the Pennsylvania Private Road Act, Pa. Stat.

The trial court denied the individuals' motion for summary judgment, and denied their motion for a protective order against such disclosure. It ordered the individuals to reveal their identities, subject to a confidentiality order. The superior court quashed the appeal, finding that the summary judgment denial was not a collateral order and that the protective order was not appealable. On further appeal by the individuals, the supreme court found that the summary judgment order did not qualify as a collateral order, nor was it a final order. However, it found that the discovery order relating to the denial of the protective order was an exception to the final order rule and came within the collateral orders that were appealable under Pa.

The trial court determined that the legislation was passed in a manner that entitled petitioners to relief under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3, and a preliminary injunction was granted. On appeal, the court initially found that petitioners had standing as their interests were direct and sufficiently immediate, the enrolled bill doctrine did not preclude judicial review, and all of the necessary parties required by 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth appealed the order of the Cumberland County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania) granting limited post-sentence relief following defendant's drunk driving conviction. The trial court granted relief only to the extent that it vacated its original directive that ordered defendant to install an approved ignition interlock system on each of his motor vehicles as a condition precedent to restoration of his operating privileges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of his second drunk driving offense. As a result, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7002(b) required the trial court to order installation of interlock ignition systems on defendant's vehicles and to certify to the department of transportation that the systems had been installed. The supreme court found that the imposition of such responsibilities under 2000 Pa. Laws 63, codified at 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7001 et seq., violated the separation of powers provision of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The provisions in 2000 Pa. Laws 63 that delegated to the courts the executive responsibility of regulating whether and when repeat drunk driving offenders were entitled to conditional restoration of their operating privileges were more properly vested in the department of transportation, a part of the executive branch. The unconstitutional provisions, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7002(b), 7003(1), (5), could be severed from the remainder of 2000 Pa. Laws 63. The remaining provisions still authorized the department to impose an ignition interlock restriction, and the Commonwealth had available to it ample means of enforcing that provision.</SPAN></P>

Trial Court Judge: Pamela Pryor Dembe, Judge.  <BR>Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, 553 Pa. 485, 720 A.2d 79, 1998 Pa. LEXIS 2364 (1998)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought review of the order of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), denying his petition for relief pursuant to the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9541 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of the first-degree murder of a police officer and was sentenced to death. The inmate's judgment of sentence became final on June 10, 1991. The inmate filed the instant petition on July 3, 2001. The petition was not timely filed pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9545(b)(1), because it was not filed within a year of the date the judgment became final. The inmate asserted that he failed to raise the claim previously as a result of unconstitutional interference by governmental officials, which was an exception to the time bar pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9545(b)(1)(i). In asserting this claim, the inmate alleged that his Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9541 et seq., counsels failed to investigate the claim that a hit man admitted to killing the police officer. The inmate's argument that his PCRA counsels were agents of the Commonwealth due to their failure to investigate the claim failed, as the Commonwealth was not a beneficiary of poor defense lawyering. Furthermore, the inmate was just making a thinly veiled ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which could not circumvent the timeliness requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney worked for the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue. Just prior to her retirement, she requested advice from the Commission as to whether 65 Pa. Cons.

The Commission held that &sect; 1103(g) was a valid regulation that did not violate the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to regulate the conduct of attorneys. On appeal by the attorney, the Commonwealth Court held &sect; 1103(g)&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to the attorney. On further appeal, the court initially found that the decision of the Commission was a &quot;final order&quot; pursuant to 65 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1108, and accordingly it was appealable. Further, the attorney had standing to raise the issue, as she had a direct interest in the outcome. The court agreed that 65 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1103(g) was unconstitutional as applied to the attorney, in that it purported to regulate former employees and it was directed specifically at attorneys. Accordingly, it violated Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that the amendments to 18 Pa. Cons.

However, the trial court held that the amendatory clauses were meant to be considered as statutory factors in determining the gradation of the offense, rather than as additional elements. The superior court affirmed the trial court's conviction and interpretation of the statute. On further appeal, the court found that the amendments to &sect; 6106 were construed and intended as sentencing factors. Although appellant's constitutional arguments were not preserved, the court reviewed them in the context of statutory construction. The court found that the avoidance canon, in order to maintain the constitutionality of the legislation at issue, supported the construction of the additional clause as sentencing factors, and also, that they were not intended to be affirmative defenses. The court found that appellant's contemporaneous conviction under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6108 supported the felony grading of his conviction under 18 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 6106(a).</SPAN></P>

After defendants were convicted, they each filed a motion for extraordinary relief, arguing that the sexually violent predator provisions of Megan's Law II violated the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. The trial court declared the provisions unconstitutional, and the Commonwealth appealed. The state supreme court held that (1) the provisions of Megan's Law II which required sexually violent predators to register with state police, to notify state police when they moved, and to obtain counseling were nonpunitive, protected members of society, and were constitutional; (2) the provision of Megan's Law II which allowed authorities to provide information about persons who were determined to be sexually violent predators to people who requested that information was constitutional; but (3) the provision of Megan's Law II which allowed the Commonwealth to incarcerate a sexually violent predator who did not comply with the notification, registration, and counseling provisions was unconstitutional because it was manifestly in excess of what was needed to ensure compliance.</SPAN></P>

Count one of the complaint sought relief against the state police and against the commissioner and his deputy in their official capacities in the form of a declaratory judgment and an injunction. Counts two and three were trespass claims. The government formerly enjoyed immunity from such claims. The common pleas court, pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 761(a)(1)(v), generally had jurisdiction over such claims. The commonwealth court did not have ancillary jurisdiction over the case pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three counts of institutional sexual assault, in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3124.2. She moved to quash the bills of information and have the charges dismissed. The Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), granted the motion, finding that the statute was unconstitutional for lacking an express mens rea requirement. The Commonwealth appealed directly to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was whether 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3124.2 was unconstitutional. Specifically, defendant argued that the terms &quot;inmate&quot; and &quot;employee&quot; were vague. The state supreme court concluded that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute's plain language revealed the legislature's intent to prohibit sexual contact between correctional staff and inmates. Defendant, as a corrections officer, was unquestionably an &quot;employee&quot; of a correctional facility. The persons with whom she allegedly had sexual contact were indisputably &quot;inmates&quot; at that facility. Defendant's alleged conduct was precisely what the legislature intended to proscribe when it enacted the statute. In addition, the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad because it did not punish a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. Rather, the statute regulated conduct that fell within the scope of otherwise valid criminal laws that reflected legitimate state interests. Finally, the statute was not unconstitutional for lacking an express mens rea requirement because applying 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 302(c) to require at least recklessness rendered the statute perfectly constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought and was granted reinstatement of his appeal rights nunc pro tunc via a petition he filed under the Pennsylvania Post-Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.

Defendant was granted limited review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The state's highest court held that adequate circumstantial evidence proved that defendant intended to inflict serious bodily injury upon a police officer. The officer testified that defendant pointed a gun in his direction and fired two shots from a distance which increased the danger of serious bodily injury or death. Defendant fired the shots at the officer after realizing the officer had observed defendant firing his gun multiple times at another man. That defendant had no license for the gun, combined with a permissive inference instruction, provided the jury with further reason to reject defendant's accidental shooting claim. The instruction permitting an inference of criminal intent from defendant's failure to license the gun was within the Due Process Clause and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The jury could rationally draw an inference of criminal intent from the fact that the gun defendant fired was unlicensed. The fact that the gun was not lawfully purchased or licensed rationally supported an inference that it was intended to be used precisely as it was used, unlawfully against other people.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant public officials appealed from an order of the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court granting judgment on the pleadings to plaintiffs, a local school district, parents, and others (the challengers), in an action seeking injunctive relief and a declaration that the Pennsylvania Education Empowerment Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect;&sect; 17-1701-B through 17-1716-B, was unconstitutional as applied to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act allowed for Commonwealth takeovers of poorly performing school districts, but allowed greater local control of the effort in very large cities. In an effort to allow such a mayor-led effort in the state capital, a smaller city, the statute allowed, at Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 17-1701-B, for a pilot program in cities that had certain characteristics that only applied to the capital, although others could qualify if their school districts performed badly. The high court held that the provision did not violate anti-special legislation, equal protection guarantees of the United States or Pennsylvania Constitutions, because the provision rationally related to the goal of properly educating all children and other cities could become a member of the eligible class of cities as well. Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; III and Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 41412 protected cities against changes in their form of government, but giving a mayor additional responsibilities for schools was hardly the sort of radical change at which the constitutional and statutory provisions were directed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter for entry of judgment in favor of the public officials.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth filed a petition for allowance of appeal of the order of the Pennsylvania Superior Court vacating defendant's judgment of sentence and remanding for resentencing. Defendant filed a cross-petition for allowance of appeal, claiming that the superior court erred in rejecting his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary and other related offenses. Defendant was sentenced, pursuant to former 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9714 (1998), to the mandatory minimum of 25 years' imprisonment and the mandatory maximum of 50 years' imprisonment. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court previously found that former 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9714(a)(1) (1998) was unconstitutional. Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims were to be reviewed on collateral review rather than on direct appeal. The superior court erred in relying on the supreme court's previous finding that former 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9714(a)(1) was unconstitutional in reversing defendant's sentence, because defendant was sentenced under former 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9714(a)(2) (1998). The trial court's sentence of defendant to the mandatory minimum of 25 years in prison was only consistent with former &sect; 9714(a)(2). Former 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9714(a)(2) was severable from former 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9714(a)(1), as former 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9714(a)(2) was independent of and separable from former 42 Pa. Cons.

The victims died of multiple gunshot wounds. Defendant was arrested in New York City. As defendant and the homicide detectives drove toward the trial court's jurisdiction, defendant raised the issue of the killings. The detective advised defendant of his Miranda rights. Defendant confessed to the three murders. At the hearing on defendant's motion to suppress the confession, defendant denied having spoken to the detective about the murders. Whether defendant confessed was an issue of credibility. Because there was competent proof that defendant made the statement, the trial court was not required to suppress the statement based solely on defendant's claim that he never made or signed it. The circumstances of the drive from New York City did not establish that the confession was coerced. The detective testified, and defendant confirmed, that no attempt was made to coerce defendant into confessing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the female victim had previously been involved in a romantic relationship. The female and male victims became involved in a relationship. Defendant rented two cars. He requested his paycheck at his employer's main office. Defendant told his daughter that he was going to kill the male victim. The next day when the victims arrived at the female victim's workplace, defendant fatally shot the victims in the head. Defendant fled in a rental car. On appeal, defendant raised multiple claims of unpreserved trial court error. In curtailing what had been an expansive relaxed waiver rule applied in capital cases, the supreme court held that, as a general rule on capital direct appeals, claims that were not properly raised and preserved in the trial court were waived and unreviewable. There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of first-degree murder under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2502(a). The evidence supported the finding that defendant acted with specific intent to kill when he shot both victims in the head at close range with a shotgun. The evidence of defendant's preparations established premeditation.</SPAN></P>

Most of his claims related either to denial of his motion to suppress or to alleged ineffectiveness of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been convicted of murder and other violent offenses before he was charged with a brutal abduction, rape, murder, and abuse of the corpse of a young woman. He first argued that his statements to police were inadmissible, but the high court agreed that circumstances supported the determination that defendant had voluntarily waived his Miranda rights. Defendant's statements to another prisoner while he was incarcerated on another matter were not subject to a right to counsel. The limits the trial court placed on voir dire did not deprive defendant of his right to trial by jury. The victim's mother's testimony during the guilt phase related only to damage sustained by her car the night of the murder, not to the impact of the victim's death. The jury was entitled to know the underlying circumstances of defendant's past crimes. None of the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel survived the Strickland test, and there was no reason to conduct a post-trial mental examination of defendant. Since the former statute under which defendant received enhanced sentences for his non-murder crimes had been held unconstitutional, defendant would have to be resentenced on remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of sentence of death, but vacated the judgments of sentence for rape, kidnapping, and abuse of corpse, and remanded for resentencing on those offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's stay of execution did not conform to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9545(c).

It was unnecessary to continue a stay of his execution to consider questions of the timeliness of his petition. It was inappropriate to adopt a &quot;non-frivolous&quot; standard whereby a stay of execution would be issued if an inmate filed a post-conviction petition that was not frivolous. To continue the stay of execution, the inmate had to meet the requirements of &sect; 9545(c), showing his petition was timely and he had a strong likelihood of success on the merits. His petition was not timely, and the exception to the time requirement in &sect; 9545(b)(ii) did not apply, as he argued prior counsel was ineffective, which was not a newly discovered &quot;fact.&quot; He could not show his other claims of after-discovered evidence and governmental interference. As a result, the court had no jurisdiction to review his claim, and the stay of execution could not be continued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a county and a tax lien assignee, sought review from an order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded in part an order of the common pleas court that dismissed a class action brought by appellee taxpayers in their action alleging unjust enrichment and fraudulent scheme by the assignee to assess, bill, and collect unauthorized amounts on the assigned tax liens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county assigned its title and rights to a large number of tax liens. The assignee required that delinquent taxpayers pay the tax amount as well as penalties, 12 percent interest, costs, and counsel fees. The common pleas court dismissed the complaint, holding that the taxpayers failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect;&sect; 7182, 7184. It also held that the county could assign the liens as well as the right to charge the additional amounts. On appeal, the commonwealth court found that exhaustion of remedies was not required and reversed the dismissal, and also held that the assignment was proper. However, it found that the maximum chargeable interest rate was 10 percent and there was no right to collect counsel fees. On further appeal, the court held that exhaustion of remedies was not required because this was not a routine challenge to the liens and equity was available. The court found that interest at 12 percent was collectible under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5648, that there was no right to collect counsel fees under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect;&sect; 7106(a), 7187, and 7271, and that costs were collectible under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 7103.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the reversal of the dismissal of the complaint, reversed the finding that only 10 percent interest was collectible, affirmed the finding that counsel fees were not collectible, and remanded the matter for a further determination as to the amount of costs that were collectible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth appealed the order of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), granting the petition for habeas corpus filed by petitioner on the ground that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5511(h.1)(6) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the police officers saw two bleeding pit bull dogs and equipment commonly used to train dogs for dogfighting, the officers seized a video camera and two videotapes. One videotape contained two recorded dogfights. Petitioner was clearly seen on the dogfight videotape standing above the fighting ring with his arms crossed, watching the fight. Based on petitioner's attendance at the dogfight, he was charged with violating 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5511(h.1)(6). In finding that &sect; 5511(h.1)(6) was unconstitutional, the trial court found that it failed to place ordinary individuals on notice as to what conduct violated &sect; 5511(h.1)(6). The trial court found that &sect; 5511(h.1)(6) eliminated a mens rea requirement for culpability and imposed strict liability for mere presence at the fight. Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5511(h.1)(6) was neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad, as it did not impose strict liability on a person merely for being present at a dogfight. Rather, it criminalized a person's conscious decision to attend an illegal animal fight as a spectator, and by doing so, put individuals on sufficient notice as to what conduct was proscribed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was sentenced to 7-20 years imprisonment for rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, and to a consecutive term of five years probation for aggravated assault. He was denied parole six years later. Although the inmate couched his underlying claim as an ex post facto violation, clearly his punishment was not increased by the changing of the statute under which his parole was determined, which was Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 331.1. The rewording of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 331.1 did not create a substantial risk that parole would be denied any more frequently than under the previous wording, nor did the addition of this language create a new offense or increase the penalty for an existing offense. Reordering of considerations for necessary decisions within an unchanged penalty did not rise to an ex post facto violation. Therefore, the inmate's claims did not raise an ex post facto issue. As the inmate failed to articulate a true constitutional claim, no relief was due, and the court left for another day the question of the propriety of habeas corpus as a remedy in the instant situation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was whether 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6310.1(a) required the Commonwealth to prove that defendant knew that the purchaser was a minor. The state supreme court concluded that the superior court acted beyond its authority by permitting liability to attach where a defendant &quot;should have known&quot; that the purchaser was a minor because doing so improperly broadened the mens rea requirement of the statute. Because the Pennsylvania General Assembly had set forth the mens rea requirement of a knowing and intentional sale to a person who was a minor and no other contrary purpose of the mens rea requirement plainly appeared, the state supreme court held that conviction of the charged offense required proof that the sale to the minor was knowingly and intentionally undertaken. Because the trial court found that the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew that the person to whom he was selling was less than 21 years of age, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6310.1(a) was not violated. The Commonwealth failed to prove the mens rea requirement of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that &sect; 4-493(10) was a content-neutral law aimed at minimizing the negative secondary effects of nude dancing, and thus was to be evaluated under the United States Supreme Court's four-prong O'Brien test. It found &sect; 4-493(10) to be constitutional, as all four prongs of O'Brien were satisfied: (1) preventing negative secondary effects associated with nude dancing fell within the constitutional power of the government; (2) the law furthered the important government interest in preventing such negative secondary effects; (3) the government interest was unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and (4) the restriction on free expression was no greater than was essential, as &sect; 4-493(10) did not bar nude dancing outright, and even in licensed liquor establishments, the dancers remained free to perform wearing pasties and g-strings.</SPAN></P>

Counsel did not have to try to rehabilitate jurors who could not impose the death penalty, acted reasonably in conceding defendant's presence at the crime scene, and did not err by not raising diminished capacity, as defendant would not make a required criminal liability admission. After defendant killed one victim, he was not entitled to a 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711(e)(1) mitigation instruction that he had no criminal history, despite such a stipulation, which did not extend to both murders. An instruction that defendant, as a murder accomplice, could not be sentenced to death absent proof of intent to take life or contemplation that life would be taken, was unnecessary as his intent to kill, supporting first-degree murder, had been found. The aggravating circumstance of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711(d)(14), regarding drug activity, was not void for vagueness as it adequately told the jury what it had to find.

Because the primary purpose of their business was martial arts/karate instruction for self-defense, self-discipline, and self-confidence, with an only accompanying benefit of physical fitness, the business was not a &quot;health club&quot; pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 73, &sect; 2162. Therefore, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the centers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant business operated an establishment with nude dancing. Appellee city and the City Council of Erie, Pennsylvania enacted a public indecency ordinance that made it a summary offense to appear in public in a state of nudity. The trial court's order, regarding the ordinance's constitutionality, was reversed by order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania). The case was remanded following reversal by the United States Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The highest state court found that it was left with a circumstance where it had to decide a Pennsylvania constitutional question where the federal law was fluid and changing and not entirely clear. In doing so, the court found that Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, provided greater protection for speech and conduct than did U.S. Const. amend. I. It approached the ordinance at issue in the instant case in a common sense fashion. An obvious purpose of the ordinance was to directly burden the freedom of expression itself, i.e., the erotic message of the dance. The highest state court detected a content-based motivation to suppress the expressive nature of the dance. As such, the court found that an intermediate level of scrutiny was inappropriate. Although the expression at issue was not political speech, the court was nevertheless satisfied that it was communication within the contemplation of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. While curbing crimes such as prostitution and rape was a compelling government interest, the ordinance was not narrowly tailored to meet this compelling interest. The goals could be achieved by less restrictive means, without burdening the guaranteed right to expression.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The highest court found that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The order of the lower appellate court was reversed, and a portion of the ordinance was severed.</SPAN></P>

The intermediate appellate court rejected defendant's challenge for failure to raise a substantial question of law, since his sentence was within the statutory limits. The high court rejected the Commonwealth's assertion that defendant failed to raise his issue before the trial court. The court held that defendant could not challenge the trial court's dismissal for failure to raise a substantial question of law until it actually dismissed his challenge. That court found that 42 Pa. Cons.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed his petition for relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act (Act), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9541 et seq., without a hearing. The areas of law were the timeliness of the petition, whether petitioner waived issues by failing to raise them earlier, whether his claims were previously litigated, and whether his prior counsel were ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, who had been sentenced to death for two murder convictions, raised more than 20 claims for relief. On appeal, the court held that the petition was filed in a timely manner, because it was filed within one year of the effective date of the 1995 amendments to the Act, which incorporated the timeliness requirements into 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9545 of the Act. However, pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9544(b), 15 of petitioner's claims had been waived by his failure to raise the issues before trial, at trial, on direct appeal, or in a prior state postconviction proceeding. Pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9543(a)(3), he had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his allegations of error had not been waived. Likewise, pursuant to &sect; 9543(a)(3), the court refused to consider an ineffectiveness of counsel claim that had been previously litigated. Another such claim failed on the merits, because petitioner failed to establish that his prior counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to investigate and present mental health mitigation at petitioner's penalty phase hearings. None of petitioner's other claims of ineffectiveness of counsel had merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying petitioner relief under the Act.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held, to the extent he raised constitutional ineffectiveness claims, they were not waived under 42 Pa. Cons.

Defendant did not show counsel was ineffective for not introducing equivocal evidence of his adjustment to prison between his two sentencing hearings, as he did not show counsel had no reasonably objective basis for not introducing the evidence. His claim that the prosecutor's peremptory challenges were racially discriminatory was waived, as it was not raised at trial, on direct appeal, or before the post-conviction relief court and was first raised in a reply brief. Failing to present testimony of a co-defendant claiming to be the actual killer, contrary to a prior statement, was not ineffective assistance, as it was not shown counsel knew of the testimony or that it was objectively unreasonable not to present the testimony.

No mitigating evidence on defendant's childhood was suppressed, and there was no evidence the prosecutor elicited a co-defendant's perjury. A co-defendant's intoxication did not have to be revealed. Defendant's lack of cooperation with discovery of mitigation evidence about his childhood precluded his claiming ineffective assistance on this basis. Lack of evidence of his psychological problems was not ineffective assistance as a defense psychologist found none.

The jury found two aggravating circumstances and no mitigators, and he was sentenced to death. The high court upheld the sentence on his direct appeal, and in the instant opinion, upheld the sentence against his post-conviction relief petition. The direct review had already established that petitioner had not been prejudiced by any alleged race discrimination or any other impropriety in jury selection, and there had been no showing that the Commonwealth had suppressed evidence that would have helped petitioner. He had an ample opportunity to present his arguments that he was impaired by drug use and brain injury at the time of the crimes. The jury instructions were accurate statements of the law. Although a few prosecutorial comments were unduly inflammatory, the trial court took care to adequately cure any effect they might have had on the jury. Since petitioner could not show that the trial court committed prejudicial error, counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to the trial court's rulings, and no evidentiary hearing was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was a prosecution witness to aggravated assault committed by defendant. There was sufficient evidence to support the murder conviction where it was shown that defendant intended to kill the victim in order to prohibit his testimony, and in furtherance thereof he slashed the victim's tires, waited for the victim, slashed his throat, and concocted an elaborate alibi. The court found that the prosecution's peremptory challenge against a particular juror was race-neutral, in that she had equivocated on the death penalty. There was no error in admitting photocopies of letters that defendant mailed to his girlfriend. Those which were turned over to the police by the girlfriend's brother were not protected under U.S. Const. amend. IV or Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because there was no state action; others were not protected by the attorney-client privilege because they were between non-lawyers. The court found evidence to support the sentence of death, finding that defense victim impact testimony was irrelevant where there was only an aggravating circumstance, and that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711(c)(2) was constitutional. Other objections to the penalty phase lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of, inter alia, two counts of murder and two counts of burglary. Appellant was sentenced to death. The conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. Appellant then filed several petitions for post conviction relief and for habeas corpus relief against the State. The Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division (Pennsylvania), denied the petitions. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant raised several claims which had been previously litigated or were otherwise waived for purposes of the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.

The appellate court ruled that to be eligible for relief under the PCRA, a petitioner needed to establish that his allegations had not been previously litigated or waived. However, appellant did raise two claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that were properly developed and were reviewable. The appellate court found that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present sufficient evidence of mitigation at the penalty phase, including evidence of appellant's history of abuse and his mental illness and dysfunction, and that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise trial counsel's ineffectiveness in this regard. During the penalty phase, trial counsel presented virtually no evidence of mitigating circumstances. There were several areas of mitigation, including appellant's hospitalizations, life history, and mental health. There was a reasonable probability that the outcome of the penalty deliberations would have been different if these issues were presented.</SPAN></P>

The Department denied the petitions as did respondent Pennsylvania Board of Finance &amp; Revenue. The Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania) found no constitutional violation but found that the taxpayer was entitled to statutory relief. Both sides appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Taxpayer's principal offices were in Pennsylvania and it conducted business throughout the United States. Pursuant to, inter alia, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 7601, 7602, of the Pennsylvania Tax Reform Act of 1971, 1971 Pa. Laws 6, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 7101- 10004, Pennsylvania imposed a franchise tax on out-of-state corporations to reach value from in-state business activity. Relying on constitutional fairness principles of the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause, taxpayer attacked the absence of factor representation in single-entity, franchise value apportionment, which related to value generated by its subsidiaries, arguing that the Department's methodology led to an overstatement of the value from its Pennsylvania business activity by about 45 percent. Although the trial court accepted taxpayer's figures in finding that it had a right to relief under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 7401(3)(2)(a)(18), the supreme court found that the taxpayer failed to show the appropriateness of its baseline figures, and thus failed to prove constitutional unfairness in the apportionment scheme applied by the Department or a right to relief under &sect; 7401(3)(2)(a)(18).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the trial court's order and remanded the cases to the trial court for reinstatement of the settlements as approved by the Board.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to rape. The sentence became final 30 days after its imposition on July 11, 1997. In August 1998, defendant filed pro se motions to appeal nunc pro tunc in the superior court and the trial court. The motions were denied. On appeal of the trial court's denial, defendant argued that he was entitled to reinstatement of his direct appellate rights nunc pro tunc, because his plea lawyer allegedly refused to file a direct appeal. In denying relief, the superior court found that defendant failed to file a timely Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. 9541 et seq. The superior court relied on a supreme court decision that was filed in 1999 to find that the PCRA was the exclusive remedy for post-conviction claims seeking restoration of appellate rights after counsel's failure to perfect a direct appeal. On appeal to the supreme court, defendant claimed that this retroactive application of the supreme court case was improper. The supreme court found that there was no retroactive application of that case, because 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9542 and supreme court cases consistently, repeatedly, and unequivocally recognized the exclusivity of the PCRA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of murdering a store manager in a hold-up. After an unsuccessful appeal, he raised many of the same issues in a post-conviction relief petition, but most of them were procedurally barred because they were or should have been decided in his earlier appeal. The high court proceeded to consider his remaining claims, which related generally to ineffective assistance of counsel (the same counsel that continued to represent him, or their colleagues), particularly in failing to investigate and produce more evidence in mitigation at the penalty phase, failure to seek more actively the admission of a prosecution witness's recantation, failure to argue more strenuously for a particular mercy instruction, and failure to pursue with greater energy various claims of racial prejudice. The court held that all these claims were meritless. Counsel was not ineffective in failing to investigate mitigating circumstances that the record did not support, in failing to pursue the admission of evidence that was not in fact exculpatory, in failing to seek a jury instruction that did not state the law, or in failing to make pointless claims of racial prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, two pairs of appellants, legal parents and their same-sex partners, challenged affirmances by two different Pennsylvania Superior Courts of trial court orders denying in each case petitions by which the parents and partners sought the adoption of the parents' children by the partners, without the parents' relinquishment of their own rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In companion cases, two same-sex couples who were already raising children together sought to have the children adopted by the partner of the legal parent. In compliance with Pennsylvania statutes, the petitions contained consents to adoption by the legal parents, but omitted language mandated by 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2711(d)(1) by which the legal parent was also required to relinquish his or her own parental rights. The high court agreed with the lower courts that the plain language of the statutory provisions allowing parents whose spouses were adopting their children to retain their parental rights applied only to step-parent adoptions. It also agreed, however, with the legal parents and partners that 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2901 gave courts discretion, upon a showing of good cause, to permit adoptions in the best interests of the children where not all the statutory conditions had been met. Since the parents and partners had never had an opportunity to try to show good cause why termination of rights should not be required, the high court directed the trial courts to hold evidentiary hearings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the orders and remanded the cases to their respective trial courts for evidentiary hearings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, city and county authority, sought review of the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court order vacating the trial court orders that found that appellee hotels failed to prove that the burdens of the hotel tax disproportionately outweighed the benefits. The appellate court found that the trial court had not conducted a proper benefit and burden analysis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and county created the county authority. The county enacted a hotel room rental tax. Most of the rental tax revenues were to be used to build a convention center. The rest were to promote county tourism. The proposed convention center project included the development of a hotel next to the convention center that was to be financially independent from the center. The hotels claimed that the rental tax violated their due process and equal protection rights. The appellate court improperly found that the trial court did not properly weigh the burdens imposed by the tax against its benefits. The trial court properly considered the impact of the convention center hotel to the extent that the new hotel would absorb a portion of the new hotel business that would have been generated by the convention center. Although the new hotel was to benefit from the convention center, so were the remaining hotels in the county. Furthermore, the hotels, as challengers of the constitutionality of the tax, were required to establish its unconstitutionality. Nevertheless, they presented no evidence about how much money they would lose to the convention center hotel each year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, school district and others (collectively, &quot;district&quot;), instituted an action against defendants, school administration union and others (collectively, &quot;union&quot;), seeking declaratory relief that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 71, &sect; 371 was unconstitutional. The Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) entered an order granting the declaratory relief. The union appealed. Political representatives were granted leave to intervene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged statute included a portion that granted school administrators employed by a city of the first class the right to bargain collectively with their public employers. The school district argued, and the trial court found, that it violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 31, which prohibited the delegation of certain legislative powers. In rejecting this argument, the appellate court found that the statute could be interpreted in a manner that delegated purely administrative decision making. The district also argued that the final statute was not considered on three different days in each house, as required under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 31. After determining that the political question doctrine, the Speech or Debate Clause, and the enrolled bill doctrine did not prohibit it from reviewing the challenge, the appellate court found that the statute was enacted in compliance with the Pennsylvania Constitution. Both the initial draft of the bill, as well as the subsequent amendments, related to the same subject. Legislation could be materially changed, without wholly changing its purpose. Policy considerations were non-justiciable, and the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 1-101 et seq., appellant state transportation department filed a declaration of partial taking for property owned by appellee landowner. The trial court ruled that the landowner's property was not landlocked. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania) reversed. The department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issues were: (1) whether Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 1-406(a) required the landowner to raise by preliminary objections the claim that the condemnation landlocked his remaining property and diminished its fair market value; and (2) whether Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 1-602(a) allowed the admission of evidence of the department's later taking of neighboring property, which served to insure that the landowner had legal access to his remaining property, on the issue of damages. The appellate court concluded that the landowner was not required to file preliminary objections. The landowner's claim went to the value of his remaining property after the condemnation, which was not a matter that had to be raised by preliminary objections. The department's subsequent taking was not admissible in determining the just compensation to which the landowner was entitled.  Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 1-602(a) provided that just compensation was the difference in relevant fair market values &quot;immediately before&quot; and &quot;immediately after&quot; a condemnation. The use of the word &quot;immediately&quot; allowed for no lapse between the taking and the point at which the landowner's property was valued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the commonwealth court was affirmed. The case was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether exigent circumstances excused the warrantless search of a vehicle after the occupants were taken into custody. In a plurality opinion, the state supreme court held that the search was valid under the Pennsylvania Constitution. The lead opinion held that exigent circumstances existed, as there was a threat of deadly harm to the police. The Pennsylvania Constitution provided greater protections than the Fourth Amendment. A police officer had to move the running vehicle, and there was testimony that the officer ran the risk of injury from a concealed weapon during that process. Further, the search was limited to secure the passenger compartment, and after the weapons were discovered, no further search was conducted. Two justices joined in finding the search proper, as probable cause arose unexpectedly, before police had a chance to secure a search warrant. Their view was that the Pennsylvania Constitution did not require more than the Fourth Amendment. One justice opined that both probable cause and exigent circumstances were required, but sufficient exigency existed, because the vehicle was running, and firearms were said to be in the area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of dumping or depositing solid waste without a permit, in violation of Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower appellate court held that defendant, as an employee, had no duty to obtain a permit, and therefore was not guilty of violating the statute prohibiting the dumping or depositing of solid waste without a permit. The supreme court found this was a case of first impression. In disagreeing with the lower appellate court, the supreme court found that the case turned on whether defendant, as an employee, was &quot;any person,&quot; under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 6018.610(1). In finding that he was, the supreme court found that the plain language of the statute did not limit liability to only those responsible for obtaining a permit. The Pennsylvania General Assembly did not intent to so limit liability. It did not result in absurd results, but punished all that were involved in the unpermitted dumping of sold waste. Defendant also argued that the statute was unconstitutional. He argued he could not be punished for not obtaining a permit when he had no duty to obtain one. In rejecting this argument, the supreme court found that he was not punished for the failure to obtain a permit, but rather the affirmative act of dumping solid waste when a permit had not been obtained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both plaintiff owners of coal mining property and defendant Pennsylvania environmental agency and officials appealed from a judgment of the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court that declared invalid some, but not all, of the regulatory designations of the owners' property as unsuitable for mining pursuant to the Pennsylvania Surface Mining Conservation and Reclamation Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 52, &sect; 1396.4e(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pennsylvania Surface Mining Conservation and Reclamation Act, at &sect; 4.5, 52 Pa. Stat. &sect; 1396.4e(b), complied with federal legislation by providing for the agency to declare certain areas unsuitable for mining because of environmental threats, particularly water pollution threats. When the agency designated a particular watershed as unsuitable, owners of coal mining property in that watershed challenged the regulation as an unconstitutional taking without compensation, violative of U.S. Const. amend. V and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The supreme court held that to make this determination, the trial court would first have to determine, as to each parcel as a whole, whether the owners had been deprived of all economically beneficial or productive use of land. If no such total deprivation was found, the trial court would have to apply the balancing test used in traditional takings case law. Finally, the trial court was to consider whether, because of the danger to clean public waterways, the danger of pollution constituted a public nuisance that could be enjoined.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the trial court ruling that one property parcel had no value for mining purposes, but reversed the remainder of the judgment and remanded for a finding of whether a taking had occurred under all applicable analyses, and for consideration of whether mining could be enjoined under a theory of public nuisance.</SPAN></P>

Although the high court held that the voters had established aggrievement for purposes of standing, it found that they had failed to show gerrymandering violative of equal protection. Noting that Pennsylvania's guarantees were coterminous to federal guarantees, it applied a federal gerrymandering test that required the voters to show that the legislators had acted with a discriminatory purpose and that this action shut Democrats out of the political process. Although the high court appreciated that the Republican legislature, as a political body, undoubtedly intended to limit Democratic chances, it held that the voters' evidence failed to establish that Democrats would be excluded from the political process.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's PCRA counsel was not ineffective due to a conflict of interest, although PCRA counsel had earlier represented one of the prosecution's trial witnesses. Defendant failed to assert how PCRA counsel's representation of the now-deceased prosecution witness affected his representation of defendant. Defendant's claim that PCRA counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a claim that previous counsel was ineffective for not objecting when the prosecution misstated the strength of evidence linking defendant to the crime scene.

The injured party appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the injured party argued that the appellate court's holding in Royer Garden was inconsistent with other cases and that the supreme court should have held that the department and the individual were jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of delay damages because they were jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the verdict. Upon review, the supreme court overruled Woods and held that delay damages recoverable from the department were limited to those calculated based upon the statutory cap. Additionally, it held that the department, as a Commonwealth party, was not jointly and severally liable for delay damages that exceed those calculated on the statutory cap. The Woods rationale allowed Pennsylvania courts to create an uncertainty of outcome to motivate settlement where no uncertainty otherwise existed. That was far different from channeling the uncertainty of outcome that existed in the case of private litigants not subject to limitations on liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the conclusion of the trial's penalty phase, the jury found the existence of two aggravating circumstances: that defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711(d)(6); and that, at the time of the killing, defendant was subject to a protection from abuse (PFA) order restricting in any way his behavior towards the victim. On appeal, the state supreme court held that defendant's suppression motion was properly denied, because: (1) his statements during the stand-off were not the product of police interrogation, but were unsolicited statements uttered in response to police negotiations designed to encourage him to surrender; and (2) the mere fact that the seizure of his clothing was not contemporaneous with the seizure of his person, but occurred after he had been removed to the place of detention, did not prevent the seizure from being incident to his lawful arrest. However, because defendant did not have anecdotal knowledge of the existence of the PFA order, he was not subject to that order for purposes of the aggravating circumstance in 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711(d)(18). Therefore, he was improperly sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The verdict of guilt was affirmed. However, the sentence of death was vacated and the case was remanded for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with defendant. Because a minimum culpability level of criminal negligence was required to convict someone of vehicular homicide, a similar level of culpability applied to the offense of vehicular homicide while driving under the influence. However, in defendant's case, the error was harmless, because the jury determined that he was criminally negligent when it convicted him of involuntary manslaughter, because a criminal negligence instruction was given on that charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the State did not disclose evidence of a photographic identification by the victim's wife, and that when she testified to such identification, the trial court should have granted a mistrial.

Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711, as geared in favor of imposing a life sentence. The state supreme court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant a mistrial, because the State, in its closing arguments, asked the jurors to disregard the victim's wife's identification testimony, and the trial court instructed the jury to consider the identification testimony with caution. Moreover, defendant was not entitled to a new penalty hearing, because the State's arguments regarding the victim were offered to counter the sympathy associated with defendant's mitigating evidence, and while the State's description of &sect; 9711 might not have been ideal, the remarks were not meant to circumvent the judicial process by interjecting considerations outside of &sect; 9711.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death after conviction of, among other things, robbery and a murder committed later the same day as the robbery. As in all death penalty cases, the high court first assured that the evidence was sufficient on every matter determined at the guilt phase. It then addressed individual claims of error, holding there was no abuse of discretion in trying both indictments together, since potential for jury confusion was slight, that there was no reason to suppose an identification was tainted, that there was no abuse of discretion in the admission of evidence, and that robbery of the murder victim could be proven without showing it was successful. Defendant's primary challenge was to the use of victim impact testimony in the penalty phase. Victim impact testimony had already been held constitutional, but the court added a prospective requirement that notice of its use be given before trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's conviction of first-degree murder, the Commonwealth appealed an order of Philadelphia County Common Pleas Court (Pennsylvania) declaring that 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a bench trial of first-degree murder and related charges. As the penalty phase began, defendant moved successfully to exclude victim impact evidence, on grounds that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711(a)(2), (c)(2) violated prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment contained in U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The high court held that there was no violation of any constitutional guarantees in this statute, which carefully limited consideration of such evidence to situations where aggravating circumstances had already been shown. Pennsylvania practice had long treated appropriate victim impact testimony as admissible where relevant, and the court expressed confidence that trial courts could limit the purposes for which such testimony was considered. Although it did not require its use, the court set forth an instruction that it recommended for trial court use in cases in which victim impact evidence was planned.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal with the common pleas court, attaching the notices of judgment on the complaint and the cross-complaint. Appellee contended that because the court had ruled in its favor on the cross-complaint and appellant never appealed that judgment as was required by Pa. R. Conduct, Office Standards &amp; Civ. P.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was found guilty of DUI in New Jersey.

Cons. Stat. &sect; 1532(b)(3) it was suspending his driver's license for one year. The trial court sustained appellee's statutory appeal, holding that New Jersey's report of the DUI conviction was insufficient and the amendment to the Driver's License Compact, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1584, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the supreme court held that 75 Pa. Cons.

In addition, the supreme court concluded that because appellee did not claim he did not know of the nature of the proceeding, or that he had no meaningful opportunity to be heard, or that he lacked notice of the actual conviction underlying the proceeding, there was no due process violation and the suspension should have been upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state prisoner sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court attacking his parole denial on ex post facto grounds. When his petition was dismissed, he appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which declined to reach the merits as the claim had not been presented to a state court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified questions of law accepted by the state supreme court were whether a person who had been denied parole could obtain review from a Pennsylvania state court of a claim that the denial of parole violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution, and, if so, what was the proper method for review. The state supreme court answered that direct review was not available, and because mandamus was not available to compel a purely discretionary act, mandamus would not be available where the substance of the board's discretionary action was the subject of the challenge. Where, however, the challenge was directed at the actions of the board taken pursuant to changed statutory requirements as opposed to the board's discretionary actions and criteria, an action for mandamus was viable as a means for examining whether statutory requirements were altered in a manner violative of the Ex Post Facto Clause. Such an action could be brought in the original jurisdiction of the state court. Absent a change in the statutes governing parole, however, denial of parole was generally a discretionary matter not subject to review.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:5D-1-14 and 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1581, and also pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(a).</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to the Drivers' License Compact of 1961, New Jersey authorities notified appellant, Pennsylvania's bureau of licensing, of the conviction. Appellant then suspended appellee's license for one year. The trial court reversed, holding that the report provided by New Jersey did not include all the required information and therefore appellee did not have proper notice. The court reversed and reinstated the suspension, holding that under the recent case McCafferty, full compliance with the reporting requirements on the part of a reporting state was not necessary. New Jersey's report of appellee's conviction identified him specifically, as well as the substantially similar, out-of-state offense of which he was convicted. Appellant's fulfillment of its duties under the compact was consistent with due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review, on direct appeal, of the Court of Common Pleas, Berks County (Pennsylvania), Criminal Division, claiming counsel was not allowed to properly cross-examine co-defendant and imposition of death penalty was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an initial conviction for murder, imposition of a life sentence and reversal for a new trial, appellant was again convicted of murder, but sentenced to death. The court affirmed his conviction and sentence. Limitation of cross-examination of co-defendant regarding his guilty plea and preclusion of police reports which allegedly contained inconsistent statements was not error. Despite some limitations on cross-examination, the jury heard co-defendant pleaded guilty to third-degree murder in exchange for his testimony. Counsel was ultimately successful in showing co-defendant another police report after which he testified he lied to police. Imposition of the death penalty on retrial was constitutional. The first jury did not make a decision on the merits regarding an appropriate penalty, did not find the State failed to prove its case and made no findings concerning aggravating or mitigating circumstances. Since it made no decision, there could not in fact be any acquittal on the merits. Nor did the imposition of a life sentence by the trial judge operate as an acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction and sentence affirmed because counsel was allowed sufficient latitude to cross-examine co-defendant and death penalty was constitutional because the prior life sentence was not an acquittal on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants and their 16-year-old daughter belonged to a religious group that did not believe in seeking medical treatment. They were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment when she died of an illness that could have been controlled. Although case law in some states applied a mature minor rule, letting older minors decline medical treatment for religious reasons, 35 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 10101 clearly set 18 as the age of consent, with only a few exceptions, not including health care decisions. Defendants also argued that decedent had a privacy right to make her own health care decisions. The court held that even though the Pennsylvania right was broader than federal privacy rights, it bowed to a compelling state interest. Since Pennsylvania had a compelling state interest in the welfare of minors, it overcame decedent's privacy right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment; since statutes provided a specific age of consent, with explicit exceptions, a mature minor rule was not appropriate. Even the protective Pennsylvania privacy rule gave way to the compelling state interest in a child's life.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the statute unconstitutional. The court affirmed. The statute placed upon an offender the burden of rebutting a mandatory presumption that, if not rebutted, would subject him or her to greater punishment. A subjective assessment of an offender's potential future dangerousness should have been made through the trial court's consideration of a variety of elements. Accordingly, resolution of competing facts presented at the post-trial proceeding, which was not governed by the rules of evidence, would most likely be outcome determinative.

At sentencing, the trial court arrested judgment for the counts of statutory sexual assault, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, aggravated indecent assault, and indecent assault, finding the statutes violated equal protection because the provisions criminalized sexual assaults where the victim was less than 16 years old and the offender was 4 or more years older than the victim. Specifically, the trial court held that there was no rational reason to differentiate among defendants based upon their age. The court reversed the decision of the trial court, noting that the right of equal protection under the law did not absolutely prohibit the Commonwealth from classifying individuals for the purpose of receiving different treatment provided that those classifications were reasonable rather than arbitrary. Further, the court agreed with appellant that the legislation served a legitimate state interest, that is, to protect minors younger than 16 years of age from older teenage and adult sexual aggressors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A revision of Pennsylvania's workers' compensation statute was enacted after both houses passed a version of the statute that had been further amended by the senate after reworking by a conference committee.

Appellant filed an appeal, alleging various procedural and trial errors.

Further, appellant's statement given to the police regarding the murders was properly admitted because appellant was not under arrest for the murders when he gave the challenged statement, it was not obtained in violation of the Davenport/Duncan rule, and was given voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently by the appellant. The pretrial publicity did not result in the inability to select a fair and impartial jury; therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion for a change of venue. Further, during the penalty phase, the trial court properly admitted evidence of aggravating circumstances and comments made by the prosecution did not prejudice the jury so that they could not have weighed the evidence objectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his co-defendant's conviction was overturned appellant, who had been tried with the co-defendant, sought postconviction relief from his own conviction.

That case went before the U.S. Supreme Court, which petitioned the court for certification of a question of Pennsylvania law, specifically, whether a particular decision of the court correctly stated Pennsylvania law as it existed when appellant was convicted. The court granted the petition for certification and answered the question in the affirmative. The earlier decision interpreted a statute,&nbsp;35 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6018.401(a), for the first time but applied familiar rules of statutory construction; therefore, the decision clarified existing law rather than stated a new rule of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, attorney general as intervenor, directly appealed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which issued a permanent injunction and declared 16 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 4216, 4217&nbsp;unconstitutional as it violated the equal protection principles of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county sheriff brought an action in equity seeking to enjoin the county from enforcing 16 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 4216, 4217 which was directed specifically at his office. The trial court issued a permanent injunction and declared the legislation unconstitutional. The court affirmed because the legislation violated the equal protection principles of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32. The statutes regulated the activities of the sheriff's employees, and plainly interfered with appellee's interest in the management and operation of his office as it limited his ability to supervise and terminate his employees, and his ability to utilize appropriated funds. Therefore, appellee sheriff had standing as he had a direct and substantial interest. The legislation effectively created a new sub-classification, of sheriffs of second class counties, which bore no relationship to the distinction of that county as a second class county, or to any unique function of the county sheriff. The legislation singled out appellee as the only county official without some discretion in the hiring, termination, or promotion of his employees. Thus, it violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment declaring the legislation unconstitutional was affirmed because it did violate the equal protection principles in the state constitution by treating one particular county officer differently from any other similarly situated officer without a fair or reasonable relationship to the object of the legislation and bore no relationship to the distinction of the particular county as a county of the second class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A public school teacher retired and received credit for additional years of service based on recent legislation. The school district nevertheless determined that the teacher's total years of service were not sufficient to qualify for additional retirement benefits. The teacher and appellant state teachers' association filed a grievance, arguing that under the collective bargaining agreement, years of service had always been calculated by the same method as that used by the public employees' retirement system, which would have qualified the teacher for the additional benefits. The arbitrator ruled in favor of appellant and the trial court affirmed, but the intermediate court reversed. The supreme court reversed, holding first that the intermediate court improperly raised the issue of unconstitutional impairment of contract sua sponte. Further, the arbitrator's award did not violate the essence test; the arbitrator properly discerned the intent of the parties in light of the parties' past practice regarding retirement awards.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from the denial, appellant contended that the 1995 amendments to the Juvenile Act were unconstitutional because they were void for vagueness and because they placed the burden of proof on the juvenile seeking transfer to juvenile court. The court held that contrary to appellant's contention that the statute was vague because it did not define the public interest standard, the statute clearly provided definite standards to be applied in determining whether a transfer would serve the public interest. The court also found that placing the burden of persuasion on appellant in no manner denied him his due process rights since the burden to prove every fact necessary for conviction was still on the state.</SPAN></P>

After informant signaled police, approximately 12 pounds of marijuana was seized from appellant's residence. Suppression court denied appellant's motion to suppress. Jury convicted appellant of possessing a controlled substance with intent to deliver, and possessing drug paraphernalia. Appellant sought review. Finding appellant waived issues of probable cause, the superior court rejected appellant's broad state constitutional challenge to anticipatory search warrants. The state supreme court granted appellant's petition for review with respect to the state constitutional claim. The supreme court affirmed, holding that Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, did not categorically proscribe the issuance of anticipatory search warrants.

Affirming dismissal, the court held pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9545(b) a petition for post conviction relief must be filed within one year of the final judgment unless an the time limitations exceptions applied. Further, appellant must prove that one of the exceptions applied.

The state supreme court reasoned that a finding that the stock clause facially discriminated against interstate commerce was compelled by caselaw. Following the report of the lower court sitting as special master, the court found respondent counties did not meet their burden of proving the stock clause was a compensatory tax, and concluded the portion of the clause excluding from personal property tax stock held in companies subject to capital stock and franchise taxes was unconstitutional. But the court also rejected petitioners' arguments against severability and found the void exclusionary language severable and that respondent counties must provide a retroactive remedy to rectify the prior unconstitutional discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commonwealth appealed from the orders of the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County (Pennsylvania), which held that 75 Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court granted defendant's motion in limine, challenging constitutionality of driving under the influence statute. In a direct appeal, the court considered whether the lower court correctly determined that 75 Pa. Cons.

The determination of &sect; 3731(a.1)'s character was essentially a matter of statutory construction. The court concluded &sect; 3731(a.1) created a permissible inference. The trial court's error was twofold: first, it treated a permissive inference as a mandatory presumption; and second, it determined the constitutionality of this permissive inference in a vacuum, before it was applied to appellee and apart from an evidentiary record. The trial court's order granting appellee's motion in limine, and requiring the Commonwealth to present relating back testimony, and declaring &sect; 3731(a.1)&nbsp;unconstitutional was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

He also argued claims of ineffective assistance at trial also qualified for an exception. The court found that appellant's petition was not timely and the court did not have jurisdiction to grant relief. To the extent that appellant contended ineffectiveness claims prevented him from raising his present claims, the exception did not apply. The trial court's refusal to grant him counsel, after his first attorney withdrew, was not grounds for an exception because appellant simply failed to raise the issue on appeal from the denial of his first petition.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's counsel presented all of the evidence available to him at the time of trial in support of the two mental health mitigators.
