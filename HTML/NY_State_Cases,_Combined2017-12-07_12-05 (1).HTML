<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Aggravated Harassment -- Aggravated Harassment in Second Degree -- True Threat </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant's verbal threats to kill the complainant, who had recently evicted defendant from a shared loft space by unilaterally changing the locks, did not constitute the requisite &quot;true threat&quot; to support a finding of guilt of attempted aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect;&sect; 110.00, 240.30 [1] [a]). Defendant's statements would not have been taken by a reasonable person in complainant's position to constitute a true threat, and were not taken by the complainant to constitute anything more than the hyperbole and exaggeration which the complainant well knew at the time the words were spoken were defendant's hallmark and stock in trade. A reasonable person in the complainant's position should have realized that defendant would become incensed upon being removed from the loft space, and should have expected a harsh response from anyone who had been locked out, let alone from defendant whom the complainant knew to be harsh in his treatment of even his best friends. The complainant also knew defendant's propensity for exaggeration of every perceived wrong in aid of making whatever point he desired at the moment. Furthermore, email exchanges showed that the complainant did not deem his life to be in danger. With regard to the complainant's prompt reporting of defendant's threats to the police, it was apparent that both endeavored to use the criminal laws to obtain whatever advantage they could against each other.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Aggravated Harassment -- Aggravated Harassment in Second Degree -- True Threat </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant was guilty of attempted aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect;&sect; 110.00, 240.30 [1] [a]) for placing a &quot;wanted&quot; poster on the complainant's front door that contained the complainant's name and a caricature, stated in large print that the complainant was a violent drug dealer and child molester, and importuned observers to call 911 to procure the complainant's arrest. The poster amounted to a &quot;true threat,&quot; as required to constitute a crime under Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (1), in that a reasonable person in the complainant's position, seeing the poster, would have deemed the poster to constitute a real threat that he or she might be arrested at any moment, and perhaps suffer physical harm if the police considered him or her to be a criminal. The complainant was alarmed, afraid and annoyed upon seeing the poster on his door, which was defendant's purpose and intention. The act of placing the poster on the complainant's door, and not merely the contents of the poster, constituted the crime, and was an intolerable invasion of the complainant's zone of privacy, as well as a true threat.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Stalking -- Stalking in Fourth Degree -- Course of Conduct </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Defendant, who verbally threatened to kill the complainant and placed a &quot;wanted&quot; poster on the complainant's front door, after the complainant had evicted defendant from a shared loft space by unilaterally changing the locks, was not guilty of stalking in the fourth degree. Pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 120.45 (1), stalking in the fourth degree requires a &quot;course of conduct ... likely to cause reasonable fear of material harm to the physical health, safety or property&quot; of a specific person. Based on the context in which they were made, defendant's statements, other than the poster, would not have caused a reasonable person in the complainant's position to fear such harm. As the poster constituted only a single act, a course of conduct could not be proved.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Harassment -- Harassment in Second Degree -- Legitimate Purpose for Conduct </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Defendant, who verbally threatened to kill the complainant and placed a &quot;wanted&quot; poster on the complainant's front door, was not guilty of harassment in the second degree under Penal Law &sect; 240.26 (3), which requires proof that the defendant &quot;engages in a course of conduct or repeatedly commits acts which alarm or seriously annoy [another] person and which serve no legitimate purpose.&quot; While defendant's conduct &quot;seriously annoyed,&quot; if not alarmed, the complainant, the conduct had a legitimate purpose--to seek restoration to what he believed to be his proper role in a performing arts project centered around a shared loft space from which he was ejected by the complainant's unilateral changing of the locks. Moreover, unlike subdivisions (1) and (2) of Penal Law &sect; 240.26, which require only a single act, subdivision (3) requires a course of conduct or repeated acts. One who is evicted by self-help may not be found guilty under Penal Law &sect; 240.26 (3) by demanding reinstatement, even if that demand is repeated, and even if the evictor is alarmed or seriously annoyed by that demand. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">HOLDINGS: [1]-As the matter was not brought to enjoin the action of any public officer, board, or municipal corporation, but, rather, the regulations implemented by the Department of Health, a transfer of venue under CPLR 6311 was inapplicable; [2]- As both Executive Order 38 itself and the Department of Health regulations in 22 NYCRR 1002, regulating financial assistance for health-related activities, were in accordance with the specific delegation of authority in Public Health Law &sect;&sect; 201, 206 and the legislative policy in N-PCL &sect; 508 concerning the expenditure of funds by not-for-profit corporations, the fact that the governor chose an executive order to pursue that policy did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Motions denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Trial -- Place of Trial -- Action against State Agencies and Officials -- Discretionary Change of Venue</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendants, the Governor and the Department of Health (DOH), were denied a change of venue from Suffolk to Albany County, in an action for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging certain DOH regulations and the executive order that called for them, because defendants identified no nonparty witnesses who would have been affected. A change of venue under CPLR 510 (3) is only warranted where it would promote the convenience of material witnesses and the ends of justice, and the change must be supported with detailed relevant information establishing that the convenience of the nonparty witnesses would be enhanced. Although CPLR 6311 would lay venue in an application to restrain a state officer in the judicial department where the officer is located, the matter was not brought to enjoin the action of any public officer or board but, rather, regulations implemented by DOH.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Separation of Powers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Regulations limiting the amount of state funds used by health care providers for administrative expenses and executive compensation (10 NYCRR part 1002), which were called for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by defendant Governor and enacted by defendant Department of Health (DOH), were promulgated pursuant to DOH's specific statutory authority and were well within legislatively mandated policy, and therefore did not violate the separation of powers. DOH has the authority to regulate financial assistance granted by the State for health-related activities (Public Health Law &sect; 201 [1] [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">o</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">], [p]) and, among other things, to enter into and negotiate the terms of contracts and subcontracts for health care services (Public Health Law &sect; 206 [3], [6]). Also, the regulations were consistent with the policy, stated elsewhere by the legislature, that not-for-profit entities such as plaintiff were to use their funds for the programs they run (N-PCL 508). In addition, the legislature had not previously attempted and failed to enact similar legislation, and the rules went into effect following a notice of proposed rulemaking, a comment period, and numerous changes in response.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Injunctions -- Preliminary Injunction -- Where Available</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In an action challenging the constitutionality of regulations limiting the amount of state funds used by health care providers for administrative expenses and executive compensation (10 NYCRR part 1002), which were called for by defendant Governor and enacted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by defendant Department of Health, a preliminary injunction prohibiting the continued implementation of the regulations was unwarranted. To obtain the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction, the moving party must demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, a likelihood of success on the merits, that the movant will suffer irreparable injury absent the relief, and that a balance of the equities favors the moving party. Here, plaintiff failed to show a likelihood of success, as the regulations were the product of a constitutional exercise of power, its claims of harm were speculative, and the legislative goal of requiring health care provid ers to use state funds for the programs they were designed to run outweighed the harm alleged by plaintiff. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1198, which requires any person convicted of a driving while intoxicated offense to install an ignition interlock device on any automobile that the person may operate as a condition of his or her probation, and makes operation of an automobile without a court ordered ignition interlock device a class A misdemeanor, is not unconstitutionally vague.

Although Penal Law &sect; 60.21 appears to be in conflict with Penal Law &sect; 60.01 (2) (d), which sets forth allowable sentences for felony convictions, the legislature's intention in adding Penal Law &sect; 60.21 was to ensure the use and monitoring of an ignition interlock device through the department of probation.

The brownfield redevelopment investors and film production credit investors were not similarly-situated groups. Moreover, the tax credit deferral provisions did not apply solely to brownfield redevelopment investors, but rather applied to more than 30 separate tax credits. In addition, such distinction could have been rationally based upon differences between the structure of each credit, the commercial desirability of each credit or the fiscal impact on the state of each credit. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs sued defendants, the New York Governor, Senate, and Assembly, alleging that the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act of 2013, Penal Law art. 265 and 400, and other state gun laws violated U.S. Const. amend. II. Defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The court found the motion well taken because plaintiffs did not challenge any specific provisions of these laws and, based on precedent from New York and federal courts, they could not demonstrate that the laws were unconstitutional in all respects and under all applications.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Right to Bear Arms -- Challenge to New York's Entire Body of Law Governing Firearms and Ammunition </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs' complaint seeking, among other things, a declaration that New York's entire body of law governing the sale, possession and use of firearms and ammunition is null and void as repugnant to the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution was dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. Plaintiff's complaint was directed generally at the State's authority to regulate the sale, possession and use of firearms and ammunition. It did not challenge any particular provision of the relevant law, which includes the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act of 2013 and Penal Law articles 265 and 400, or otherwise raise an as-applied challenge. Duly enacted statutes enjoy a presumption of constitutionality and a party who asserts that a statute is facially unconstitutional must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute suffers from wholesale constitutional impairment. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that prohibitions such as those on the possession of firearms by felons or the mentally ill, those forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places like schools and government buildings, and those imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms are presumptively lawful regulatory measures. As such, plaintiffs could not demonstrate that the laws they challenged were unconstitutional in all respects and under all applications. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a declaratory judgment action challenging the decision by defendant State to reduce defendant's contribution to justices and judges' health insurance benefits, plaintiffs sufficiently stated a claim that Civil Service Law &sect; 167 (8) violates the New York State Constitution's Compensation Clause (art VI, &sect; 25) as applied to plaintiffs. After the Commission on Judicial Compensation, charged with examining the adequacy of judicial salaries and benefits, issued its report recommending judicial pay increases in three phases, Civil Service Law &sect; 167 (8) was amended to allow the president of the Civil Service Commission to extend the terms of an agreement between the legislature and certain public sector unions reducing the percentage of defendant's contribution toward employees' health insurance premiums to unrepresented state employees and retirees, including plaintiffs. Although the amendment does not single out judges, the Compensation Clause singly protects judges from overly broad laws that have the direct effect of diminishing their compensation. The amendment has a unique impact upon the judiciary by virtue of the fact that it diminishes the compensation the judiciary is guaranteed to receive. Contributions for health insurance benefits which are deducted from a judge's paycheck are directly related to the amount of salary paid to a judge. Defendant's withdrawal of its contributions which comprise compensation, which is what section 167 (8) as applied to judges accomplishes, stands upon different footing than a nondiscriminatory, generally applied tax imposed against the compensation of all citizens by the government in its status as a sovereign.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a declaratory judgment action challenging the decision by defendant State to reduce defendant's contribution to justices and judges' health insurance benefits, defendant was not entitled to dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint as to the retired plaintiff justices. Plaintiffs, current and retired Supreme Court justices and associations representing Supreme Court justices, sufficiently stated a claim that Civil Service Law &sect; 167 (8) violates the New York State Constitution's Compensation Clause (art VI, &sect; 25) as applied to plaintiffs. The Compensation Clause expressly protects the compensation of retired justices by providing that the compensation of &quot;a retired judge or justice shall be established by law and shall not be diminished during the term of office for which he or she was elected or appointed.&quot; Defendant's explanation that the terms &quot;retired judge&quot; and &quot;during the term of office&quot; are not incongruous because &quot;during the term of office&quot; renders the no-diminution guarantee applicable to those judges who have obtained a two-year appointment upon certification pursuant to Judiciary Law &sect; 115 (1) and (2) was raised for the first time in its reply papers and was not considered.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs sued defendants, a city and its campaign finance board, seeking to enjoin it from enforcing an ordinance extending the voluntary contribution limits and restrictions applicable to candidates receiving public matching funds to &quot;non-participating&quot; candidates who were ineligible for such funds. Defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The court upheld the ordinance, finding it was neither preempted by Article 14 of New York's Election Law nor inconsistent with it, because Article 14 did not address locally funded publicly financed elections for wholly local offices.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Amendments to the New York City Campaign Finance Act extending the contribution limits and other restrictions of defendant City's public campaign financing system even to &quot;non-participating&quot; candidates (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 3-719 [2] [b]), ineligible to receive matching public funds, were permissible exercises of local legislative authority. Every local government has power to adopt local laws not inconsistent with the State Constitution or any general law relating to its property, affairs or government and, specifically, the mode of selection and removal of its officers and employees (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [c] [i], [ii] [1]; Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 [1] [i], [ii] [a] [1]). Municipal home rule powers are liberally construed (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 3 [c]; Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 51) and local laws will be upheld unless they have no reasonable basis. Here, the City Council had found the legislation necessary to reduce undue influence and increase public confidence and participation in local elections. Defendant City could address those goals under its power to protect the welfare and well-being of its citizens as well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Amendments to the New York City Campaign Finance Act (CFA) extending the contribution limits and other restrictions of defendant City's public campaign financing system even to &quot;non-participating&quot; candidates (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 3-719 [2] [b]), ineligible to receive matching public funds, were not preempted by the Election Law or inconsistent with state law. Preemption can be inferred where the state legislature has set forth a comprehensive and detailed regulatory scheme, but local governments have great latitude in addressing local issues, even when the state has already legislated in those areas. Here, although the CFA imposed greater restrictions on candidates for certain local offices than the Election Law, the restrictions had to be viewed as part of defendant City's public financing system as a whole, and the Election Law is silent on the issue of publically financed elections. The mere fact that the local law dealt with matters already touched upon by state law did not render it invalid. Moreover, the CFA amendments were aimed at promoting ethics in local government and reducing the influence of money on city elections and were complementary to state law. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A village ordinance prohibiting minors from being out in public from 11:00 p.m. (midnight on weekends) until 5:00 a.m. unless accompanied by a parent, guardian, or authorized adult over the age of 21, with certain exceptions, is constitutional under the United States and New York Constitutions. There was a substantial nexus between the curfew and the governmental interest in curbing disturbances and vandalism caused by minors, and protecting the village's children. Although the proof offered by the village as to the nexus between the burdens imposed by the ordinance and its goals was hardly scientific in nature, the village did not have to prove the relationship between its curfew and its stated goals with scientific certainty. Moreover, the ordinance did not infringe on a parent's right to substantive due process since the exceptions contained in the ordinance offered parents significant flexibility and autonomy in supervising their children. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioners, inmates and civil liberties organization, moved for an order of mandamus pursuant to CPLR art. 78 and a county charter directing respondent county executive to appoint members to the county correctional center board of visitors. The court found, inter alia, that the inmates had &quot;public interest&quot; standing to petition for a CPLR 7803(1) writ of mandamus. The county charter clearly directed the county executive to fill the seven-member board in a manner consistent with the county charter. Consequently, the county executive would be ordered to do so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Petitioner prisoners, who each alleged that they received improper medical care at the Nassau County Correctional Center and continued to have untreated or poorly treated medical conditions, had standing to challenge respondent County Executive's failure to appoint a seven-member Board of Visitors with a wide range of powers to oversee the prison as required by Nassau County Charter &sect; 2004. To establish standing to challenge a governmental action, a petitioner must show an injury-in-fact that falls within the zone of interests or concerns sought to be promoted or protected by the statutory provision under which the agency has acted. Here, the Charter provision was enacted in an attempt to address systematic failures at the jail with regard to neglecting human rights and dignity that had resulted in preventable deaths, a number of lawsuits and United States Department of Justice intervention. Thus, petitioners' alleged injuries fell within the zone of interests sought to be protected.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- Challenge to Governmental Action -- Public Interest </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Petitioner prisoners had standing under the doctrine of public interest to challenge respondent County Executive's failure to appoint a seven-member Board of Visitors with a wide range of powers to oversee the Nassau County Correctional Center as required by Nassau County Charter &sect; 2004. In matters of great public interest, a citizen may maintain a mandamus proceeding to compel a public officer to do his or her duty. Every citizen has the right to compel the performance by public officers of the duty imposed upon them of executing laws of the state which are enacted for the benefit of the community. The Charter provision satisfied this standard inasmuch as it was enacted in an attempt to address systematic failures at the jail with regard to neglecting human rights and dignity that had resulted in preventable deaths, a number of lawsuits and United States Department of Justice intervention.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- Mandamus -- When Remedy Appropriate </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Petitioner prisoners were entitled to a writ of mandamus compelling respondent County Executive to appoint a seven-member Board of Visitors with a wide range of powers to oversee the Nassau County Correctional Center as required by Nassau County Charter &sect; 2004. The remedy of mandamus is available to compel a governmental officer to perform a ministerial duty, but does not lie to compel an act which involves an exercise of judgment or discretion. Mandamus will lie to compel acts that public officials are duty bound to perform regardless of how they may exercise their discretion in doing so. Here, the language of the Charter provision stated that &quot;[t]here shall be within the Division of Corrections a Nassau County Correctional Center Board of Visitors. It shall consist of seven members, including a chairperson, each of whom shall be appointed by the County Executive subject to confirmation by the County Legislature.&quot; While mandamus would be inappropriate to compel respondent to appoint specific members to the Board, the language clearly directs the County Executive to fill the seven-member Board of Visitors in a manner consistent with the Charter.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- Mandamus -- When Remedy Appropriate -- Academic and Moot Questions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. A proceeding seeking mandamus to compel respondent County Executive to appoint a seven-member Board of Visitors with a wide range of powers to oversee the Nassau County Correctional Center as required by Nassau County Charter &sect; 2004 was not rendered moot by respondent's submission of four Board member nominee names to the County Legislature for approval. While General Construction Law &sect; 41 allows a four-member quorum of a seven-member body to exercise full power of the body, the Charter provision clearly directs the County Executive to appoint a seven-member Board. Had the drafters intended to allow the County Executive to establish a four-member Board that could vote in the absence of three of the members of a seven-member Board, they could have done so. In any event, the issue would only be moot if respondent had submitted the requisite number of names to the legislature and they were approved. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">HOLDINGS: [1]-A town zoning board of appeals properly upheld three notices of violation issued against property owners (POs) pursuant to Henrietta, N.Y., Zoning Code &sect; 295-2(B) because they had rented their properties to unrelated individuals and the properties did not qualify as legal prior existing uses; [2]-The POs' claim under CPLR 3001 that their properties were prior legal existing uses was procedurally defective because their challenge to the constitutionality of the former definition of &quot;family&quot; was time-barred under CPLR 213; [3]-The new definition of &quot;family&quot; in the zoning code amendment was not unconstitutional because it was a valid exercise of the municipality's authority.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">--Zoning--Authority of Zoning Board of Appeals to Review Constitutionality of Town Zoning Code's Prior Definition of &quot;Family&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Upon petitioners/plaintiffs' challenge to a determination of respondent/defendant town zoning board of appeals upholding notices of violation issued against them for renting numerous houses in a residential district to groups of unrelated college students allegedly failing to satisfy the amended definition of &quot;family&quot; set forth in the town zoning code, respondent/defendant's failure to address the constitutionality of the zoning code's pre-amendment definition of &quot;family,&quot; which allegedly applied to petitioners/plaintiffs' rentals, and thereby find that petitioners/plaintiffs' rentals constituted prior legal existing uses, was neither arbitrary and capricious nor affected by an error of law. Given that the powers conferred on a zoning board of appeals by statute do not include the ability to review the validity of legislative enactments such as zoning codes and that the constitutionality of the pre-amendment definition of &quot;family&quot; was never judicially determined, respondent/defendant was required to apply the presumption of validity to that definition, notwithstanding the opinion of the Town Attorney that the pre-amendment definition was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">--Zoning--Notice of Violation--Probable Cause Not Required</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A determination of respondent/defendant town zoning board of appeals, which upheld notices of violation (NOVs) issued against petitioners/plaintiffs for renting numerous houses in a residential district to groups of unrelated college students allegedly failing to satisfy the amended definition of &quot;family&quot; set forth in the town zoning code, was not set aside as an error of law or as arbitrary and capricious on the ground that the NOVs lacked probable cause. The NOVs were unambiguous in their wording that any legal action, civil or criminal, would not be commenced until after 30 days in order to allow time for petitioners/plaintiffs to respond. Although a criminal proceeding is commenced only upon the filing of an accusatory instrument (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 1.20 [16], [17]), the NOVs were not one of the permitted forms of an accusatory instrument (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 1.20 [1]), nor were they appearance tickets commencing a criminal proceeding as they did not demand petitioners/plaintiffs' presence in a local criminal court (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 1.20 [26]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Limitation of Actions--When Cause of Action Accrues--Claim for Judgment Declaring Town Zoning Code's Prior Definition of &quot;Family&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Unconstitutional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Upon a determination of respondent/defendant town zoning board of appeals upholding notices of violation (NOVs) issued against petitioners/plaintiffs for renting numerous houses in a residential district to groups of unrelated college students allegedly failing to satisfy the amended definition of &quot;family&quot; set forth in the town zoning code, petitioners/plaintiffs' claim for a judgment declaring that the pre-amendment definition of &quot;family,&quot; which allegedly applied to their rentals, was unconstitutional and thus that their rentals constituted prior legal existing uses was time-barred. Petitioners/plaintiffs had standing to contest the zoning code's definition of &quot;family&quot; before it was amended, even without having yet been issued an NOV, because their properties were subject to the zoning code's rental restriction and they would have suffered financial injury if it was enforced against them. Moreover, given that a declaratory judgment claim challenging a legislative act, such as a zoning ordinance, accrues when the law was passed, petitioners/plaintiffs here did not receive the benefit of a running accrual up until the amendment of the zoning code's definition of &quot;family.&quot; Even affording petitioners/plaintiffs the latest possible date as the accrual date when they were first subject to the zoning code based upon their ownership and rental of the properties, the statute of limitations expired before their commencement of the current action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">--Zoning--Town Zoning Code's Definition of &quot;Family&quot; Not Exclusionary Zoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioners/plaintiffs, who were issued notices of violation for renting numerous houses in a residential district to groups of unrelated college students allegedly failing to satisfy the amended definition of &quot;family&quot;--four or more persons living together as a traditional family or the functional equivalent thereof--set forth in the town zoning code, did not overcome the presumption of constitutionality afforded to the definition and meet their heavy burden of proof to invalidate it as exclusionary zoning, and the definition was thus sustained as a valid exercise of the municipality's authority. Although the power to zone is broad, a municipality may not legitimately exercise its zoning power to effectuate discrimination. Therefore, to be valid, a zoning ordinance must have been enacted in furtherance of a legitimate governmental purpose and there must be a reasonable relation between the end sought to be achieved and the means used to achieve it. Here, the zoning code's definition of &quot;family&quot;--which did not exclude all students, or even all nontraditional family units, but only those groups of four or more unrelated persons who are not the functional equivalent of a traditional family--was not exclusionary zoning, especially given that its presumption--that four or more unrelated persons do not constitute the functional equivalent of a traditional family--was rebuttable. Rather, the rental prohibition was enacted to ensure the quiet family nature of the town's residential sections--a legitimate governmental function--while still permitting reasonable rental situations and accommodating alternative familial living arrangements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's motion to dismiss his operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs and other charges under CPL 170.30(1)(f) was denied. Defendant's equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 were not violated based on the police department's failure to offer him a physical coordination test because he could not speak English. The language classification was rationally related to the legitimate state interest in avoiding inaccuracies, avoiding confusion, and complicating the investigatory process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Motion to dismiss denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Pretrial Motions -- Dismissal on Constitutional Grounds </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a prosecution for driving while intoxicated, defendant's motion to dismiss on equal protection and due process grounds was properly brought under CPL 170.30 (1) (f), given that alleged constitutional violations of this sort are not otherwise cognizable under the Criminal Procedure Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Physical Coordination Tests -- Failure to Offer Test to Non-English Speaking Defendant -- Rational Basis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. On a motion to dismiss driving while intoxicated charges on the ground that they were based on violations of defendant's equal protection rights, the police officer's decision not to offer defendant a physical coordination test due to a &quot;language barrier&quot; was subject only to rational basis review. When discrimination based on a suspect classification is established, by showing either that a law or policy is facially discriminatory or that it is intentionally applied in a discriminatory manner, strict scrutiny applies. Although it is often inextricably intertwined with ethnicity, classifications based on language alone are not suspect. Thus, for the policy of denying the test to non-English speakers to receive heightened scrutiny, defendant had to prove, with statistics or other evidence, that it had a disparate impact on a suspect class and that the police intended to discriminate against the class. Defendant offered no competent evidence concerning the number of Hispanics and/or non-English speakers who were denied the test on the basis of language compared with non-Hispanics and/or English speakers, Hispanic or otherwise. Even if he had shown a disparate impact, his conclusory assertion that police had mistreated him &quot;because he looked and sounded Hispanic&quot; was unsupported by evidence of intentional discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Physical Coordination Tests -- Failure to Offer Test to Non-English Speaking Defendant -- Rational Basis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Defendant's equal protection rights were not violated when, due to a &quot;language barrier,&quot; police did not offer him a physical coordination test before testing his breath and charging him with driving while intoxicated because the policy of withholding the test from non-English speaking suspects who will not understand it was reasonably related to legitimate state interests. State action will be upheld unless the disparate treatment is so unrelated to any legitimate purpose that it is irrational. Here, the policy was rationally related to state interests in avoiding inaccuracies, confusion, or other complications in the investigatory process. Likewise, a claim, as a class of one, that he had been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated would have failed as well, as the difference in treatment requires only a rational basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Physical Coordination Tests -- Failure to Offer Test to Non-English Speaking Defendant -- Procedural Due Process</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Defendant failed to establish that a protected liberty or property interest was at stake when, after pulling him over on suspicion of driving while intoxicated, police would not offer him a physical coordination test before testing his breath and charging him. The basic inquiry in procedural due process cases is whether governmental action has deprived an individual of a liberty or property interest within the meaning of the Due Process Clause. Regarding his proffered interest in obtaining potentially exculpatory evidence, while the People must provide access to certain evidence in their control, law enforcement has no affirmative obligation to gather on-the-scene evidence concerning potential defenses. Also, defendant failed to show that driving while intoxicated suspects have an absolute right to a physical coordination test or that the test is a non-discretionary benefit conferred on suspects by the police department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Physical Coordination Tests -- Failure to Provide Interpreter </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Defendant, a non-English speaker who had been charged with driving while intoxicated, was not entitled to have a translator present while being administered pre-arrest sobriety tests. A well-established precept of due process is that non-English speaking criminal defendants are entitled to an interpreter so that they can meaningfully participate in the trial and assist in their own defense. However, the right to an interpreter is only available once adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Physical Coordination Tests -- Failure to Offer Test to Non-English Speaking Defendant -- Substantive Due Process -- Fundamental Rights</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. No fundamental right of defendant's had been implicated by a police officer's decision not to offer him a physical coordination test before testing his breath and charging him with driving while intoxicated, such that the officer's conduct would warrant strict scrutiny. In addition to disparate treatment on the basis of suspect classifications, strict scrutiny also applies if a fundamental right is at issue. However, defendant's purported rights to the coordination test or to have a translator present to administer it were not deeply rooted in the nation's history and tradition for purposes of substantive due process analysis. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On remand from the Court of Appeals, petitioner cab owners moved for incidental damages in their CPLR art. 78 proceeding. The court found, inter alia, that while the city regulation at issue limited the rates that could be charged by taxicab owners, the owners would not be entitled to any monetary relief had the regulation been upheld. Consequently, the monetary relief that the owners sought was not recoverable as incidental damages under CPLR 7806 despite the fact that the regulation was subsequently invalidated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Having prevailed in a CPLR article 78 proceeding to annul a regulation of respondent New York City Taxi &amp;Limousine Commission prohibiting the owners of taxicabs who lease the cabs to drivers from collecting sales tax in addition to the maximum permitted lease rates, petitioner taxicab owners were not permitted to recover as incidental relief the monies they were prohibited from collecting from their taxicab lessees while the regulation was in force as respondents had no statutory duty to pay petitioners such monies either before the regulation was enacted or after it was annulled. Under CPLR 7806, any damages granted to the petitioner in an article 78 proceeding against a body or officer must be incidental to the primary relief sought. Damages are incidental if a monetary award is an automatic consequence of the equitable relief granted or, put differently, if a grant of the relief that is the primary aim of the proceeding makes it a statutory duty of the respondent to pay the petitioner the sum sought. Here, upon the regulation's annulment, petitioners sought to recover the losses they incurred by reason of their compliance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the regulation. However, the sales tax that petitioners collected from their taxicab lessees while the regulation was in effect was remitted to the State of New York. Accordingly, such monies were not funds that respondents collected or withheld from petitioners that could be refunded or paid to them.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Tort Liability -- Governmental Immunity -- Discretionary Acts</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Having prevailed in a CPLR article 78 proceeding to annul a regulation of respondent New York City Taxi &amp;Limousine Commission prohibiting the owners of taxicabs who lease the cabs to drivers from collecting sales tax in addition to the maximum permitted lease rates, petitioner taxicab owners were not permitted to sever and convert their claim for non-incidental monetary relief to a plenary action as respondents were immune from liability for damages arising out of the regulation's enactment, which involved the exercise of administrative judgment and expertise and the evaluation of policy. Under the doctrine of governmental immunity, a municipal defendant generally is not answerable in damages for the injurious consequences of its official action involving the exercise of discretion or expert&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgment in policy matters. Thus, the mere enactment of legislation cannot serve as a basis for imposing civil liability, even where the legislation is subsequently held to be unconstitutional. Here, petitioners claimed to have suffered economic loss due to the enactment of the regulation because they could no longer collect sales tax from their taxicab lessees in excess of the maximum permitted lease rates. Nevertheless, the annulment of the regulation did not subject respondents to liability for the losses petitioners claimed to have suffered by reason of their compliance with the regulation while it was in effect.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Ward's husband petitioned to revoke a mother's letters as co-guardian. The court found, inter alia, that the ward was able to exercise her legal capacity to make and act on her own decisions, with the assistance of a family and community support network. Consequently, terminating the guardianships of the ward's mother and husband recognized and affirmed the ward's constitutional and human rights and allowed a reading and application of SCPA art. 17-A that was consistent with both.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Termination of the letters of guardianship previously granted to the husband and mother of respondent, an individual with mild to moderate mental retardation, was appropriate upon respondent's demonstration that she was able to exercise her legal capacity, to make and act on her own decisions, with the assistance of a support network which had come together for her since she first appeared in court. Terminating the letters of guardianship previously granted to respondent's husband and mother recognized them as persons assisting and supporting respondent's autonomy, not superseding it. In order to withstand constitutional challenge, SCPA article 17-A must be read to include the requirement that guardianship is the least restrictive alternative to achieve the State's goal of protecting a person with intellectual disabilities from harm connected to those disabilities. Further, the court must consider the availability of &quot;other resources,&quot; like those in Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 81.03 (e), including a support network of family, friends and professionals before the drastic judicial intervention of guardianship can be imposed. Moreover, although the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities does not directly affect New York's guardianship laws, international adoption of a guarantee of legal capacity for all persons, a guarantee that includes and embraces supported decision making, is entitled to persuasive weight in interpreting our own laws and constitutional protections, and supports the application of the constitutional imperative of least restrictive alternative. </SPAN></P>

Refusing to take a breath test was a traffic infraction under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1101 and 1800(a), which provided that it was a traffic infraction unless a misdemeanor was specified for any person to violate a New York Vehicle and Traffic Law provision. While there was contrary authority, appellate cases and cases from the New York Court of Appeals had recognized that the failure to submit to a lawful request for a portable breath test was a cognizable offense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Chemical Tests -- Refusal to Submit to Field Breath Test -- Legally Cognizable Charge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Refusing to take a preliminary or portable field breath test pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1194 (1) (b) is a legally cognizable charge. A positive field breath test is one of the statutory predicates for obtaining a court order directing a defendant to submit to a chemical test, and while refusing to submit to a chemical test requested pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1194 (2) and (3) is not a cognizable offense, the legislature delineated numerous sanctions for such refusal. If refusal to take a field breath test pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1194 (1) (b) were not found to be a cognizable offense, there would be no sanction for a defendant who refuses a field breath test, which would effectively write out of Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1194 (2) and (3) a positive field breath test as a predicate for a chemical test as provided by the legislature, and would remove from the police a tool for investigating accidents and/or vehicle and traffic infractions, as intended by the legislature. Moreover, sections 1101 and 1800 (a) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which require persons to perform any act required by the Vehicle and Traffic Law and render any violations of that law at least a traffic infraction, render a defendant's refusal to submit to a field breath test a cognizable offense, more particularly, a traffic infraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Reckless Driving -- Multiple Offenses</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant was properly charged with two counts of reckless driving (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1212) since the arresting officer's supporting deposition set forth two distinct incidents. The first began when defendant's vehicle allegedly struck another and she sped away, later bringing her vehicle to a complete stop at a red light behind two other vehicles. The second commenced at that intersection, where defendant sped away from the officer, and continued until defendant allegedly collided with a vehicle stopped at a red light approaching the service road of an expressway. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution for crimes arising from defendant's former practice as an attorney, the admission of her testimony from a prior attorney disciplinary proceeding based on the same conduct did not violate her Fifth Amendment privilege, as she had chosen voluntarily to testify in the disciplinary proceeding rather than exercise the privilege and risk having her silence considered adversely in the determination of whether she should be suspended from the practice of law. Where litigants forgo the Fifth Amendment privilege in a civil matter and make statements, even in a disciplinary hearing in which an adverse inference may be drawn from the assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination, as here, those statements may be used in a subsequent criminal case. Here, an adverse inference based on defendant's silence only would have been permitted in the disciplinary proceeding, and even there her silence alone would not have been sufficient to justify suspension or disbarment.</SPAN></P>

In a prosecution for theft and related crimes arising from defendant's former practice as an attorney, her false testimony at an attorney disciplinary proceeding based on the same conduct, regarding the whereabouts of client funds, was relevant as evidence of consciousness of guilt, regardless of whether she may have had another motive for testifying falsely. Although evidence of consciousness of guilt may be ambiguous, it is appropriate to instruct the jury on the evidence's weakness and allow the jury to consider it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs taxpayers said an amendment to Tax Law &sect; 632(a)(2) was unconstitutionally retroactively applied to their income from the sale of a subchapter &quot;S&quot; corporation. Defendants state officials were entitled to summary judgment because the amendment was not unconstitutionally retroactively applied as (1) the amendment was rationally related to clarifying that an ALJ's decision did not accurately reflect existing law or longstanding policy, (2) the retroactivity period was rationally related to legislative goals, and (3) the taxpayers showed no cognizable detrimental reliance on prior law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies -- Exhaustion Unnecessary for Pure Legal Issues -- Constitutional Challenge to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs were not obligated to exhaust administrative remedies before commencing a declaratory judgment action challenging amendments to the Tax Law as applied to them, since they were not challenging the amount of their tax assessments but the statute's constitutionality and applicability. Nor was it necessary to develop a factual record through administrative procedures because only pure legal issues were outstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Personal Income Tax -- Retroactive Application of Tax Statute -- Due Process -- Nature of Tax Statute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. As relevant to plaintiffs' due process challenge to the retroactive application of the 2010 amendment to Tax Law &sect; 632 (a) (2)--which addresses New York source income of nonresident shareholders of S corporations--in view of the text itself, the legislative history and the long-standing policies of defendant Department of Taxation and Finance, the amendment did not create a wholly new tax. A statute that creates a &quot;wholly new&quot; tax may run afoul of due process where its retroactive application is not limited to a short period; in contrast, a retroactive tax statute that is &quot;curative&quot; or &quot;clarifying&quot; in nature is less susceptible to invalidation. Here, legislative findings indicated that the amendment was necessary to correct aberrant administrative decisions that conflicted with long-standing policies of defendant, which were evident in a range of defendant's decisions, advisory opinions and other materials. Also, the amendment added text to an existing statute, providing specific examples of the general matters already set out in the first part of the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Personal Income Tax -- Retroactive Application of Tax Statute -- Due Process -- Rational Legislative Purpose</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The mere retroactive application of the 2010 amendment to Tax Law &sect; 632 (a) (2)--which addresses New York source income of nonresident shareholders of S corporations--to taxable years beginning with 2007, subject to the statute of limitations, did not offend due process. The retroactive application of a tax statute will ordinarily be upheld unless, in light of the nature of the tax and the circumstances in which it is laid, retroactivity is especially harsh and oppressive. Due process is satisfied where retroactive application is justified by a rational legislative purpose. Here, the statute was amended to clarify the existing statute and to correct erroneous administrative decisions that had disrupted settled policy. The retroactivity period, as limited by the statute of limitations for seeking a refund or assessing additional tax, was geared toward enforcement in outstanding matters and was rationally related to the legislative goals of providing clarity and preventing confusion by making it clear that taxpayers could not rely on those erroneous decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Personal Income Tax -- Retroactive Application of Tax Statute -- Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiffs, nonresident shareholders of an S corporation, were not denied due process by the retroactive application of the 2010 amendment to Tax Law &sect; 632 (a) (2), which had merely clarified the statute and corrected aberrant applications of it in administrative decisions, because there was no cognizable detrimental reliance on those decisions and the amendment was otherwise appropriately applied. The retroactive application of a tax statute will ordinarily be upheld unless retroactivity is especially harsh and oppressive, considering, among other things, the taxpayer's forewarning of a change in law and reasonable reliance on old law. Here, plaintiffs could not have reasonably relied on the erroneous view because the decision they cited was issued by an administrative law judge, whose decisions have no precedential force generally (Tax Law &sect; 2010 [5]), two years after the closing of the stock transaction for which they were assessed additional tax. Moreover, a range of Department of Taxation and Finance decisions, advisory opinions and other materials demonstrated its long-standing policy of taxing the transaction here and that the administrative determinations to the contrary were erroneous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Personal Income Tax -- Nonresident Taxpayers -- Due Process -- Connection between Taxpayer and State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Plaintiff nonresidents, sole shareholders of an S corporation, were sufficiently connected to New York to be assessed tax on gain they recognized on payments from installment obligations the corporation distributed, under 26 USC &sect; 453 (h) (1) (A), as nearly 50% of the corporation's business involved sales of New York tangible personal property. All that is required to satisfy due process is some minimal connection between the taxpayer and the taxing state, and that the income the state seeks to tax is rationally related to values connected with the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Officers -- Liability for Discretionary Act -- Governor Unamenable to Suit Based Solely on Duty to Execute Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In an action challenging the constitutionality of the retroactive application of an amendment to the Tax Law, all claims against defendant Governor, based solely on his duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed (NY Const, art IV, &sect; 3), required dismissal. A state official's duty to execute the laws is not enough by itself to make that official a proper party in a suit challenging a state statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff judges filed a motion to renew their motion for summary judgment in their action against defendants, State and state officials, for failure to provide them with a salary increase or cost of  living adjustment since 1998. The court found, inter alia, that while a motion to renew was appropriate to raise the Legislature's failure to provide for retroactive compensation, the judges did not establish that it did not abide by the Court of Appeals' declaration that it address judicial compensation under N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 25(a) without linking it to other legislative matters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Upon renewal, no further relief afforded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Recusal -- Action Challenging Judicial Salaries -- Doctrine of Necessity</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Supreme Court presided, under the doctrine of necessity, over an action challenging the legislature's failure to provide state judges with salary increases over the course of many years, despite the court's personal interest, because the case could not be determined in any other forum. Although judges generally must recuse themselves from cases in which they are personally interested, only New York State issues that could not have been resolved in a federal or other state court were involved here, and all state judges were similarly interested. Here, the judge disclosed his strong feelings about the matter and his relationships with those involved, stated that he believed he could be fair nevertheless, and the parties declined his offer to recuse himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Renewal as Appropriate Means of Review in Previously Disposed Action</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Where the legislature had previously been found, including on appeal, to have violated the separation of powers by improperly tying judicial salaries to unrelated policy initiatives and legislative pay adjustments, and had since established a judicial salary commission and increased salaries prospectively, renewal of plaintiffs' summary judgment motion was an appropriate means to assess the legislature's efforts. The requirements of renewal are not inflexible, and the court has discretion to grant renewal where subsequent circumstances have developed warranting reconsideration, and, in appropriate circumstances, even after appeal. Given the delicate balance involved in remedying a violation of the separation of powers doctrine and the recognized province of the courts in assessing whether the legislature has met its constitutional obligations in that regard, the flexibility of a motion to renew could, in certain circumstances, afford an appropriate means to assess legislative compliance. Renewal was appropriate here where the legislature established the commission after the Court of Appeals decided the matter but did not enact any retroactive salary increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Separation of Powers -- Judicial Salaries May Not be Linked to Other Legislative Business</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Plaintiffs, who had successfully challenged the legislature's failure to provide state judges with any salary increase since 1998, were not entitled to relief based upon the legislature's continued delay in providing a judicial salary adjustment after the final declaration by the Court of Appeals with respect to judicial compensation, and the legislature's failure to provide for a retroactive adjustment. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Matter of Maron v Silver</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (14 NY3d 230, 925 NE2d 899, 899 NYS2d 97 [2010]) the Court directed only that the legislature appropriately and expeditiously address judicial compensation without regard to unrelated policy initiatives or legislative compensation adjustments. The Court concluded that whether and by how much judicial compensation should be adjusted was within the legislature's province. Thereafter, legislation was enacted creating a commission to review judicial salaries, and the commission increased salaries prospectively. Plaintiffs failed to establish that the legislature did not abide by the declaration of the Court of Appeals as to the legislature's constitutional duties. There was no contention that the legislature continued to link the salaries to other legislative business. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed a decision that convicted him of feeding wild white-tailed deer or wild moose in violation of 6 NYCRR 189.3(b). The appellate court found, inter alia, that while defendant admitted to feeding the wildlife that came into his yard, which violated 6 NYCRR 189.3(b) and 189.2(f), the regulations failed to provide minimal guidelines to law enforcement or sufficient clarity so a person of ordinary intelligence would understand what was prohibited.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Prohibition against Feeding Wild White-Tailed Deer Unconstitutionally Vague on its Face </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. 6 NYCRR 189.3 (b), which provides that &quot;[n]o person shall feed wild white-tailed deer,&quot; is unconstitutionally vague on its face as it does not adequately define the offense with sufficient clarity so that a person of ordinary intelligence would understand the type of conduct which is prohibited. &quot;Feed&quot; or &quot;feeding&quot; is defined as the act of using, placing, giving, exposing, depositing, distributing or scattering any &quot;material&quot; that attracts wild white-tailed deer to feed on (6 NYCRR 189.2 [f]), but 6 NYCRR part 189 fails to define &quot;material.&quot; Moreover, a person is unable to determine if his or her conduct constitutes &quot;feeding&quot;--for example, placing a garbage can filled with &quot;material&quot; out for pickup, or planting fruit trees that attract deer on private property. Thus, the regulation, as written, allows law enforcement agents to pursue some cases and not others, depending on how they arbitrarily define &quot;material&quot; and/or prohibited conduct. The failure to provide even minimal guidelines to law enforcement, thereby allowing for unpredictable and inconsistent enforcement and prosecution, violates the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Prohibition against Feeding Wild White-Tailed Deer Unconstitutionally Vague as Applied </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In the prosecution of appellant for violating 6 NYCRR 189.3 (b), which provides that &quot;[n]o person shall feed wild white-tailed deer,&quot; the regulation as applied to defendant, who admitted placing food in his backyard that attracted deer, was unconstitutionally vague. The trial transcript showed that appellant did not understand why or how his conduct of tossing fruit in his private yard violated the regulation. Moreover, even if appellant had read the regulation, he would not have been on notice that throwing rotting fruit into his yard for otherwise lawful purposes could cause him to violate the regulation, while foliage and trees in his backyard that might attract deer would not be a violation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Prohibition against Feeding Wild White-Tailed Deer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Unconstitutionally</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Overbroad </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. 6 NYCRR 189.3 (b), which prohibits the feeding of wild white-tailed deer, where &quot;feeding&quot; is defined as using, placing, giving, exposing, depositing, distributing or scattering any &quot;material,&quot; or maintaining the availability of such material, that attracts wild white-tailed deer to feed on (6 NYCRR 189.2 [f]), is unconstitutionally overbroad. The act of feeding or attracting white-tailed deer can be an act of expressive conduct of conservation prohibited by the content-neutral regulation in question. Content-neutral regulations of time, place, and manner of expression are enforceable if they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest. The regulation here reaches substantially beyond the justified governmental interest of preventing the spread of chronic wasting disease. It leaves no alternative for the lawful feeding of other animals that inhabit the woods, fields and backyards, as any material that incidentally attracts deer places someone in violation. Moreover, the regulation does not require that the deer actually feed on anything, but rather that the deer are merely attracted to feed on such material, thus substantially increasing the amount of conduct prohibited under the regulation and curtailing constitutionally protected conduct, such as planting certain food crops intended for human consumption and lawful landscaping of private property. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff business entities filed an action for a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction to determine the constitutionality of certain adult entertainment zoning law amendments and to prevent their enforcement. The court found, inter alia, that given their current arrangements and secondary characteristics, the business entities no longer operated in an atmosphere that placed more dominance of sexual matters over non-sexual ones. Consequently, as there was no need for the zoning amendments at issue, they violated the free speech provisions of the U.S. and State Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Zoning Amendments Restricting Adult Establishments </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 2001 amendments to the definition of &quot;adult establishment&quot; in New York City Zoning Resolution &sect; 12-10, enacted to cover entities which, while allegedly in compliance with 1995 zoning amendments requiring a substantial portion (at least 60%) of an entity's business to be devoted to nonadult uses (the 60/40 entities), had presumably still set their dominant focus on adult issues, were unconstitutional as a violation of free speech. Prior to the 1995 amendments, adult establishments devoted 100% of their business to adult issues, were highly concentrated in particular neighborhoods and used graphic signage and other forms of advertising. As a result of the restrictions imposed by the 1995 amendments, the high concentration of adult businesses in particular neighborhoods was eliminated. In addition, after adopting the amended standards, the 60/40 entities all contained separate adult and nonadult sections, had more product or space devoted to nonadult features, featured legitimate activities in the nonadult section, and in most instances housed the adult section in the back of the establishment. Almost no garish neon lighted signs were used, no hard-core sexual images or language appeared on the signs and the nonadult signage was as prominent as the adult signage. Advertising had also changed to include conventional newspapers, magazines, television and Internet. These significant and distinct changes indicated that the 60/40 entities no longer operated in an atmosphere placing more dominance on sexual matters over nonsexual ones. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information charging him with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct as facially insufficient. The court found, inter alia, that there was sufficient evidence to support the information charging defendant with refusing a lawful order to disperse and resisting arrest under Penal Law &sect;&sect; 240.20(6), 205.30 during a protest. However, there was insufficient evidence that he caused &quot;public inconvenience, annoyance, or harm&quot; or demonstrated the requisite mens rea to violate &sect; 240.20(5).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The information charging defendant with disorderly conduct in violation of Penal Law &sect;240.20 (5) following his arrest at a protest, based on allegations that he was among a group of people on a sidewalk one afternoon, &quot;jumping up and down&quot; and &quot;thereby causing people to walk around&quot; them and into the street, was facially insufficient. Under Penal Law &sect;240.20 (5), &quot;[a] person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof . . . [h]e [or she] obstructs vehicular or pedestrian traffic.&quot; However, something more than a mere inconvenience of pedestrians is required to support the charge. Here, the facts alleged did not establish &quot;public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm&quot; or the requisite mens rea. Factors such as the extent of harm, whether defendant persisted after warnings by police or others, and whether his conduct created a risk of disorder weighed in his favor.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Disorderly Conduct -- Refusal to Comply with Lawful Police Order -- Facial Sufficiency </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The information charging defendant with disorderly conduct in violation of Penal Law &sect;240.20 (6) following his arrest at a protest, based on allegations that one police officer observed another give an order to disperse and defendant refused to do so, was facially sufficient. Under Penal Law &sect;240.20 (6), &quot;[a] person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof . . . [h]e [or she] congregates with other persons in a public place and refuses to comply with a lawful order of the police to disperse.&quot; Defendant's claims that police had violated his rights of free speech and assembly and related defenses required fact-finding and could not be addressed on review of the information's sufficiency, and the mens rea element could reasonably be inferred from defendant's conduct.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Resisting Arrest -- Facial Sufficiency </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The information charging defendant with resisting arrest based on allegations that he refused to place his hands behind his back during an authorized arrest, making it difficult to handcuff him, was facially sufficient. Penal Law &sect; 205.30 prohibits persons from intentionally preventing or attempting to prevent an authorized arrest. Since the charge on which the arrest was based was facially sufficient, the arrest was based on probable cause and therefore authorized.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Information -- Dismissal in Interest of Justice </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The interest of justice did not warrant dismissal of the information charging defendant with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest based on his conduct while participating in a protest, as, in view of the factors set forth in the statute, the State's interest in prosecuting him outweighed his interests. CPL 170.40 (1) grants courts discretion, which should be exercised sparingly, to dismiss a prosecution where, even though there may be no legal basis for dismissal, some compelling factor exists that clearly demonstrates that the prosecution would result in injustice. Here, the State's interest in police regulation of the streets, which is crucial for public safety and convenience, was implicated. No severe miscarriage of justice could have resulted, as defendant was alleged to have intentionally violated the law, and dismissal would have undermined public confidence in the justice system. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner drug treatment provider petitioned for judicial review of a determination and order by respondent State Division of Human Rights (SDHR) that dismissed her complaint--against a judge for unlawful discrimination--for lack of jurisdiction. The court found, inter alia, that the judge's letter to the provider terminating her services was an exercise of his judicial functions under Judiciary Law &sect; 2-b(3) as the presiding judge of the treatment courts. Therefore, as judicial immunity attached to the acts at issue, the SDHR properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the matter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent State Division of Human Rights (SDHR) properly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over a complaint alleging unlawful discrimination by respondent judge who, in an official letter as presiding judge of a city drug and alcohol court and a county felony drug court, notified petitioner that those courts would no longer utilize an alcohol and drug treatment business owned by petitioner and referenced events at petitioner's residence without specific details as to the basis of the decision. The &quot;recent events&quot; mentioned in the letter were in reference to the arrest of petitioner's live-in boyfriend for drug possession and sale and the publicity it received. Respondent judge's letter to petitioner was an exercise of the judge's judicial functions and judicial immunity attached to the acts at issue. As presiding judge of the treatment courts, respondent judge had the authority to establish a procedure necessary to carry into effect the powers and jurisdiction of those courts, and to preserve his courts' dignity and integrity. Accordingly, respondent SDHR's determination that it lacked jurisdiction over the complaint was neither arbitrary and capricious, nor affected by an error of law. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner taxpayers filed an application seeking a refund of all property taxes paid since 2002 in connection with an alleged illegal assessment increase by defendants, city, assessor, and board of assessment review, plus interest. The court found, inter alia, that the selective reclassification of the taxpayers' property from residential to commercial absent a citywide reassessment violated RPTL 305(2) (2003), N.Y. Const. art. I &sect; 11, and the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A change in the use classification of petitioners' real property from residential to commercial did not constitute a rational basis for reassessing the single property absent a citywide reassessment and, thus, was &quot;selective reassessment&quot; in violation of the State and Federal Constitutions and of RPTL 305 (2), which provides that all real property in each assessing unit shall be assessed at a uniform percentage of value. The reassessment was not part of a citywide program and resulted in significantly increased taxes. The ad hoc reassessment based on change of use had no rational basis in law and violated statutory and constitutional provisions concerning the equality of taxation and equal protection. Notably, the selective reassessment was not necessary to maintain a uniform percentage as required by RPTL 305 (2). Moreover, RPTL 727 (2) (i), which provides an exception to the mandatory three-year freeze on reassessments following a judicial determination reducing the assessment where there has been a change in the use or classification of the property, was inapplicable since there was no basis to support extending an exception in an unrelated statute to curtail guarantees of the State and Federal Constitutions. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss a charge under Penal Law &sect; 220.77(1), which alleged that he directed a heroin operation. The court found, inter alia, that &sect; 220.77(1) limited prosecution to the director of a controlled substance organization during a defined time period with a specified valuation of proceeds, which criteria were not dependent upon the subjective conclusions of law enforcement. Consequently, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Controlled Substances -- Operating as Major Trafficker -- Constitutionality of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 220.77 (1), which defines the crime of operating as a major trafficker in controlled substances, is not unconstitutionally vague. The statute addressed compelling and legitimate legislative goals by creating new offenses or elevated punishment levels for those who operate as major drug traffickers. As used in the statute, the terms &quot;director&quot; and &quot;controlled substance organization&quot; were not unconstitutionally vague: through the inclusion and specific definitions of the words &quot;director&quot; and &quot;organization,&quot; the proscribed conduct was sufficiently identified (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 220.00 [18], [19]), and a person of ordinary intelligence had fair notice that his or her contemplated conduct was forbidden by the statute. One could certainly comprehend that acting as a principal administrator, organizer or leader, on more than one occasion, of a controlled substance organization of defined monetary scope is proscribed behavior that would subject one to punishment. Although the phrases &quot;twelve months or less&quot; and &quot;proceeds collected or due from such sale or sales&quot; were not specifically defined, their meanings were easily understood by ordinary individuals, and the failure to define all material terms in a criminal statute does not render it unconstitutionally vague. Moreover, the statute provided sufficient guidance to law enforcement officials to preclude arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, as it limited prosecution to the director of a controlled substance organization during a defined time period with a specified valuation of proceeds. </SPAN></P>

Therefore, PERB had jurisdiction over the matter.

While the Charter Schools Act is silent regarding the joint public-private employment doctrine, the language in Education Law &sect; 2854 (1) (a), stating that &quot;to the extent that any provision of [article 56] is inconsistent with any other state or local law, rule or regulation, the provisions of [article 56] shall govern and be controlling,&quot; expresses a legislative intent to preempt the conflicting application of the joint public-private employment doctrine with respect to charter schools. Moreover, application of the joint public-private employment doctrine here would essentially abrogate provisions that apply to charter schools generally, without any exemption for charter schools associated with private entities, particularly Education Law &sect; 2854 (3) (c-2), which requires charter schools to follow principles of &quot;employer neutrality&quot; as guaranteed by recourse to Civil Service Law &sect; 209-a regarding &quot;improper employment practices,&quot; and section 2855 (1) (d), which provides for termination of a charter based on a charter school's intentional employee rights violations under the Taylor Law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent Public Employment Relations Board's (PERB) determination that petitioner charter schools, which had contracted with a private corporation for operation of the schools and employment of the schools' staff, were political subdivisions of the state under 29 USC &sect; 152 (2) and were thus exempt from the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board was not arbitrary and capricious. An employer is considered a political subdivision of the state if it is administered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or to the general electorate. Here, notwithstanding that the schools' governing bodies were not appointed or subject to removal by public officials, PERB analyzed the Charter Schools Act and the legislative intent in making its determination. Under the circumstances, including that there is no settled federal law on the issue, the court could not substitute its own interpretation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Public Employees' Fair Employment Act -- Charter Schools -- Designation of Managerial and Confidential Employees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Respondent Public Employment Relations Board erred in determining that petitioner charter school, which had contracted with a private corporation for operation of the school and employment of the school's staff, could not designate all assistant principals as &quot;managerial&quot; or &quot;confidential&quot; employees under Civil Service Law &sect; 201 (7) (a). A plain reading of the Charter Schools Act stating that &quot;an employee of a charter school shall be deemed a public employee&quot; (Education Law &sect; 2854 [3] [a]) is that the Legislature intended to have the Taylor Law applicable to charter schools. The Legislature did not expressly employ any language precluding the designation of &quot;managerial&quot; or &quot;confidential&quot; employees and there was no legislative intent to treat charter schools and traditional public schools differently in that regard. Moreover, nothing in the Charter Schools Act required petitioner to designate a chief executive officer before employees can be designated &quot;managerial&quot; or &quot;confidential.&quot; The private corporation had employed an individual to serve in the functional capacity of a chief executive officer and a formal designation by the school board of trustees was immaterial. In addition, the record substantially demonstrated that the assistant principals were functioning in a &quot;confidential&quot; capacity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A determination by respondent Public Employment Relations Board declaring that, for purposes of the Taylor Law (Civil Service Law &sect; 200 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), petitioner charter schools, which had contracted with a private corporation for operation of the schools and employment of the schools' staff, were the sole employers of their employees, did not unconstitutionally impair the corporation's obligations under the management agreements with the schools. The determination did not address questions outside what is permitted under the Taylor Law, and therefore did not declare that the schools are employers for all purposes or disengage the corporation from the substantial management role it plays pursuant to the agreements. The Charter Schools Act (Education Law art 56) expressly allows the type of contractual arrangements at issue here, and there is no prohibition against delegation of the schools' operational and management functions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant filed a motion to preclude his retrial for second-degree murder and first- and second-degree manslaughter on ground of double jeopardy. The court found, inter alia, that the evidence at defendant's first trial was legally sufficient to support a charge of second-degree manslaughter under Penal Law &sect; 125.15(1). However, because the indictment did not contain such a charge as a lesser-included offense of a dismissed second-degree murder charge, double jeopardy precluded a retrial on the manslaughter charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Double Jeopardy -- Retrial -- Dicta </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A prior court decision vacating defendant's second-degree murder conviction based solely on a finding that defendant had received ineffective assistance of counsel did not provide a basis to bar defendant's retrial based on the legal sufficiency of the evidence, despite comments made by the court in the prior decision concerning the lack of evidence to show that defendant had intentionally shot anyone. Whatever comments were made in the prior decision concerning the legal sufficiency of the evidence were dicta given that the issue of legal sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the murder charge was not before the court on defendant's motion to vacate the judgment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Vacatur of Judgment of Conviction -- Review of Sufficiency of Evidence by Trial Court before Retrial </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a prosecution in which the defendant was successful on his CPL article 440 motion in vacating his murder conviction on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel and the People chose not to take an appeal from that decision, there was no sound policy reason why the trial court, in deciding defendant's motion to bar retrial on double jeopardy grounds, should not undertake the same review of the legal sufficiency of the evidence at the first trial that an appellate court would have undertaken on defendant's direct appeal if the murder conviction had been upheld on defendant's motion. Generally, where a new trial is ordered for reasons other than insufficiency of the evidence, the trial court's denial of a trial order of dismissal reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence is deemed to be an adequate protection to prevent an unconstitutional retrial. Here, however, information was brought to the attention of the trial court following the denial of defendant's motion for a trial order of dismissal that the defendant, in fact, did not kill the person he was seen chasing in a surveillance video, and that the victim was a bystander to the chase. Defendant, despite whatever remedy might exist on appeal should there be a conviction after a second trial, had never been afforded a proper review by the trial court of the legal sufficiency of the evidence at the first trial, since defendant's motion to vacate the judgment was grounded on ineffective assistance of counsel. Such a review would furnish the protection against defendant being unconstitutionally tried for a second time if the evidence at the first trial was legally insufficient.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Vacatur of Judgment of Conviction -- Judicial Economy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a prosecution in which defendant's motion to vacate a judgment convicting him of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon was granted as to the murder charge on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel, considerations of judicial economy as well as law and equity favored the trial court's review of the legal sufficiency of the evidence presented at defendant's first trial upon defendant's motion to bar retrial on double jeopardy grounds. Should the court find the evidence insufficient and dismiss the murder charge, the People would have the right to appeal that decision in which case the sufficiency of the trial evidence concerning the murder charge could be reviewed concurrently with defendant's appeal from that same trial which resulted in the weapons conviction. Because defendant's murder conviction was vacated on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel, the court's decision not to vacate that conviction on other grounds, such as insufficiency of evidence or prosecutorial misconduct, did not adversely affect the defendant. Therefore, issues concerning the sufficiency of the evidence or prosecutorial misconduct regarding the dismissed murder conviction would not be reviewable by the Appellate Division on either the defendant's direct appeal from the judgment convicting him of the weapons charge or on his potential appeal from the denial of his motion to vacate the judgment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Murder -- Transferred Intent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In the prosecution of defendant on second-degree murder and related charges, the jury's finding of defendant's intent to kill the person he had been chasing could not be &quot;transferred&quot; to provide legally sufficient evidence of defendant's intent to kill the person actually killed where the jury's finding of an intent to kill was based on the argument that because defendant killed the person being chased, defendant's chase demonstrated a homicidal intent towards that person. It was determined after trial that the victim was a bystander to the chase and not the person being chased. As defendant did not kill the person being chased, the jury's finding of an intent to kill that person was undermined and could not serve as a basis to conclude that defendant had a homicidal intent. Moreover, there was no evidence that defendant actually attempted to shoot the person he was chasing, even though a surveillance video showed that defendant had an opportunity to do so, particularly when the person fell to the pavement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Murder -- Discharge of Gun -- Sufficiency of Evidence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In the prosecution of defendant, who was seen on a surveillance video chasing someone other than the victim, a bystander to the chase, the evidence was legally insufficient to show that defendant had either an intent to kill or cause serious physical injury to anyone, which are elements necessary to support charges of second degree murder or the lesser included offense of first degree manslaughter. The video did not depict the shooting itself, and the trial evidence did not establish whether the single, fatal shot was fired before or after the chase. Moreover, the evidence at trial did not establish where, at the time the gun was discharged, the defendant, the person being chased and the actual victim were situated in relation to each other, or to the scene depicted in the video, or even what they were doing at the time. Without knowing where the person being chased was in relation to defendant at the time of the shooting, it was complete speculation to assert that defendant intended to shoot that person or anyone else when the gun discharged and struck the actual victim. There was no evidence other than defendant's own statement to show what defendant was doing when the gun discharged, and that statement asserted that the gun accidentally discharged when someone in a crowd grabbed defendant's arm.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Manslaughter -- Reckless Behavior </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. In the prosecution of defendant, who was seen on a surveillance video chasing someone other than the victim, a bystander to the chase, the evidence was legally sufficient to support a conviction for manslaughter in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 125.15 [1]). Defendant's own statement claimed that he brought what he believed to be an unloaded gun to the scene merely to scare people, as evidenced by his chase, and that he acted in response to a volatile street-gang territorial dispute over his presence at the scene earlier that evening. Furthermore, the jury would have had a right to reject the self-serving portion of defendant's statement claiming that he did not believe the gun was loaded but that, nevertheless, he carried it into the teeth of a potential gang confrontation. Accordingly, knowingly bringing a loaded gun into such a situation and then chasing someone with it, where there were numerous other people present, may qualify as reckless behavior under Penal Law &sect; 15.05 (3), and when such behavior results in the shooting death of another, a charge of second-degree manslaughter would be established.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Lesser Included Offense -- Retrial of Homicide Charge </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. In the prosecution of defendant arising from the shooting death of the victim, because the trial evidence was legally insufficient to establish that the defendant intentionally shot anyone, double jeopardy principles barred the People from re-trying defendant on charges of second degree murder or the lesser included offense of first-degree manslaughter. Accordingly, because the murder charge was the only remaining charge in the indictment, the indictment was dismissed. However, the trial evidence was legally sufficient to establish the charge of manslaughter in the second degree, also a lesser included offense of second-degree murder on which the jury was charged but on which it did not reach a verdict, because, as instructed, that charge was not considered once the jury had decided to convict defendant of murder. Consequently, even though the evidence was found to have been legally insufficient to sustain the murder conviction, double jeopardy principles did not bar a retrial on a lesser included offense which was charged to the jury but on which no verdict was returned. Because the indictment did not contain a charge of second-degree manslaughter as a lesser included offense of the now dismissed charge of murder in the second degree, the defendant could not now be tried on a charge of second-degree manslaughter. Therefore, the People were granted leave to re-present appropriate charges to another grand jury</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a special proceeding seeking a review of the reapportionment of the New York State Senate, the petition for declaratory and injunctive relief barring respondents from enforcing the amendment to State Law &sect; 123 increasing the size of the Senate from 62 to 63 districts was denied and the court declared that the formula prescribed in article III, &sect; 4 of the New York Constitution did not forbid New York from increasing the size of the New York State Senate to 63 seats in 2012. Article III, &sect; 4 sets the formula for increasing the number of State Senate districts based upon population growth and requires that the state's population pursuant to the most recent census be divided by 50, the number of senatorial districts in 1894. Because certain counties did not exist in 1894 and because certain 1894 Senate districts were comprised of more than one county, the calculation for determining the size of the Senate requires that certain counties be combined. As article III, &sect; 4 is silent as to that process two methods have been developed over the years to combine such counties, and the Legislature used both methods in 2012 with respect to different county pairs. Although the Legislature used one method for Queens and Nassau Counties and a different method for Richmond and Suffolk Counties, petitioners did not sustain their heavy burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the Legislature had acted unconstitutionally. The Legislature must be given some flexibility with the formula. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Separation Agreement -- Provision Requiring Sale of Marital Residence before Parties May File for Divorce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a divorce action, plaintiff husband was entitled to partial summary judgment on his cause of action for a declaratory judgment determining that the clause in the parties' separation agreement that required the parties to sell the marital residence before either may file for divorce was unenforceable as against public policy because it impermissibly restricted the parties' ability to divorce. New York public policy favors the ability of spouses to terminate a marriage. As a result of the separation agreement's no-divorce clause, the parties' marriage could be interminable depending on the interest and proclivities of New York City apartment buyers, and absent the apartment selling, neither party would ever be able to divorce the other.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Separation Agreement -- Separation Agreement Valid and Enforceable Despite Clause of Agreement Deemed Void as against Public Policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a divorce action, defendant wife was not entitled to an order striking the parties' entire separation agreement after the clause in the agreement prohibiting either party from filing for divorce before the marital residence was sold was deemed unenforceable as against public policy. When a clause in a separation agreement is voided, it can be severed and the rest of the agreement may stand. Moreover, courts must, to the greatest extent possible, defer to separation agreements. Here, the agreement contained a severability clause and both parties bargained for the agreement and had lawyers during negotiations. Thus, despite the fact that one paragraph in the 39-page agreement was deemed to contravene public policy, the rest of the agreement was valid and remained enforceable. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner, who was born a female, filed a petition for an order stating that he would forever be known as a male. The court found, inter alia, that neither the New York State Department of Health nor the court had a basis under Public Health Law &sect;&sect; 4100(1)(a), 4138 for entertaining the petitioner's request for an order recognizing his gender reassignment surgery and declaring him to be of the male gender.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Records--Birth Certificate--Gender Change</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A special proceeding brought by petitioner, who was born in California as a female but subsequently underwent irreversible gender reassignment surgery, in which he asked the court to issue an order stating that &quot;A.B.C., born . . . in the female gender, will be known now and forever as being of the male gender,&quot; was denied. Petitioner sought the order with the intention of submitting it to the State of California to obtain an amended birth certificate changing the gender listed thereon to male. Petitioner did not seek any relief from the named respondent, the New York State Department of Health, implicitly conceding that respondent cannot change birth certificates issued in other states. Moreover, the court lacked a basis for entertaining petitioner's request as an ex parte application. The prosecution of the matter in the form of a special proceeding was not authorized, and conversion of the special proceeding to a declaratory judgment action would be futile as there was no actual contest involving an adverse party. Although New York has no statute giving a party a right to petition a court to recognize a change of gender and there is no authorization from the Legislature for the court to direct the amendment of a birth certificate as to a person's sex, petitioner could file a petition in California for a judgment recognizing his change of gender, and ordering the issuance of a new birth certificate reflecting such change. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant town filed a motion for summary judgment in plaintiff gas lessee's hybrid CPLR art. 78/declaratory judgment action that sought to invalidate a zoning ordinance amendment prohibiting hydrofracking.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The court permitted the filing of amicus curiae briefs in a declaratory judgment action seeking invalidation of a zoning amendment that, in effect, prohibited hydrofracking within defendant town by banning all activities related to the exploration for, and production or storage of, natural gas and petroleum. The criteria considered in deciding whether to permit the filing of amicus curiae briefs included whether the applications were timely; whether each application stated the movant's interest in the matter and included the proposed brief; whether the parties were capable of a full and adequate presentation of the relevant issues and, if not, whether the proposed amici could remedy that deficiency; whether the proposed briefs identified law or arguments that might otherwise escape the court's consideration or would otherwise be of assistance to the court; whether consideration of the proposed amicus briefs would substantially prejudice the parties; and whether the case involved questions of important public interest. No one factor was dispositive. Although the parties had very capably advanced their respective positions, there was no prejudice to them in permitting the two proposed amici who had filed timely motions which indicated their interest in the action and included their respective proposed briefs to be heard here--a case of first impression involving a matter of important public interest. The motions of the proposed amici, however, were granted only to the extent that the movants presented arguments related to the issues in controversy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. An unincorporated association comprised of approximately 71 individual members who were residents or landowners in defendant town was not entitled to intervene as of right in a declaratory judgment action seeking invalidation of a zoning amendment that, in effect, prohibited hydrofracking within the town by banning all activities related to the exploration for, and production or storage of, natural gas and petroleum. A party is entitled to intervene as of right only upon a showing that the representation of its interests by the parties is inadequate and that it may be bound by the judgment; both elements must be present (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 1012 [a] [2]). Here, association members had shown no substantial interest in the outcome of the action unique from those of any other town resident or landowner. Moreover, defendant was the proper party to defend the zoning amendments which it enacted, and it had met that duty by capably advancing its position. The association's submissions did not materially add to the defense advanced by defendant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Intervention -- Intervention by Permission -- Action Seeking Invalidation of Zoning Amendment Prohibiting Hydrofracking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. An unincorporated association comprised of approximately 71 individual members who were residents or landowners in defendant town was denied permission to intervene in a declaratory judgment action seeking invalidation of a zoning amendment that, in effect, prohibited hydrofracking within the town by banning all activities related to the exploration for, and production or storage of, natural gas and petroleum. Although the only requirement for obtaining an order permitting intervention pursuant to CPLR 1013 is the existence of a common question of law or fact, the resolution of such a motion is nevertheless a matter of discretion. Here, association members had shown no substantial interest in the outcome of the action unique from those of any other town resident or landowner; defendant was the proper party to defend the zoning amendments which it enacted; defendant had met that duty by capably advancing its position; and the association's submissions did not materially add to the defense advanced by defendant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those factors weighed in favor of exercising the court's discretion to deny permissive intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- When Remedy Available -- Challenge to Substantive Validity of Zoning Amendment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding/declaratory judgment action seeking invalidation of a zoning amendment that, in effect, prohibited hydrofracking within defendant town by banning all activities related to the exploration for, and production or storage of, natural gas and petroleum, defendant's motion seeking judgment dismissing that part of the petition and complaint which sought relief under CPLR article 78 was granted. Petitioner/plaintiff had challenged only the substantive validity of the zoning amendment, not the procedures utilized in its enactment. Unlike challenges directed to the procedures followed in the enactment of an ordinance, challenges to the substantive validity of a legislative act may not be maintained in an article 78 proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Gas and Oil -- Local Regulation -- Hydrofracking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Defendant town's zoning amendment banning all activities related to the exploration for, and production or storage of, natural gas and petroleum, which, in effect, prohibited hydrofracking within the town, was not preempted by the Oil, Gas and Solution Mining Law (ECL art 23 [OGSML]). The supersedure clause contained in the OGSML, which states that the provisions of the OGSML &quot;shall supersede all local laws or ordinances relating to the regulation of the oil, gas and solution mining industries; but shall not supersede local government jurisdiction over local roads or the rights of local governments under the real property tax law&quot; (ECL 23-0303 [2]), did not expressly preempt defendant's zoning amendment. Where, as here, a statute contains an express supersession clause, resolution of the issue turns on proper construction of the clause by interpreting the plain meaning of the text in light of the relevant legislative history and the underlying purposes of the statute. The plain meaning of OGSML's express supersession clause is that it does not expressly preempt local regulation of land use, but only regulations dealing with operations. Moreover, the legislative history did not suggest that the Legislature intended to encourage the maximum ultimate recovery of oil and gas regardless of other considerations, or preempt local zoning authority. The part of the zoning amendment invalidating permits lawfully issued by another governmental agency, however, was preempted, as it related directly to regulation of the oil and gas industries. </SPAN></P>

Once a party has stated under oath that the marriage has been irretrievably broken for a period of at least six months, the cause of action for divorce has been established as a matter of law and there is no basis for directing a trial. Moreover, the Legislature intentionally declined to enact a defense to a cause of action under section 170 (7) and neither defendant husband nor the court may create one. Even assuming defendant was entitled to a defense regarding section 170 (7), his general denial of plaintiff's allegations that the marriage was broken down irretrievably was belied by his sworn statements in his prior verified complaint for a judgment of divorce based on constructive abandonment. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a CPLR article 78 proceeding commenced by petitioner challenging respondent New York City Police Department's License Division's revocation of his premises residence handgun license, respondent's motion to dismiss was granted since the determination was rationally and amply supported by the undisputed evidence of petitioner's repeated noncompliance with respondent's regulatory requirements. A licensee's violation of any of respondent's rules regulating handgun licenses may be grounds for revocation or suspension of his license (38 RCNY 5-21). Here, petitioner violated 38 RCNY 5-30 (d) when, after a domestic incident in his home where the police entered and charged him and his wife with criminal offenses and confiscated his firearms, he did not immediately notify respondent, but delayed notification for seven days. Petitioner also undisputedly left his handguns in an unlocked container and accessible to other persons, including his children, and although petitioner suggested that his wife unlocked the cabinet where his handguns were stored, the facts still demonstrated the violation of the statutory and regulatory requirements (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;38 RCNY 5-01 [a]; 5-22 [a] [12], [13]). Moreover, petitioner did not immediately report to respondent his receipt of a summons after the domestic incident (38 RCNY 5-22 [c] [1]) or his receipt of an order of protection for himself against his wife the next day (38 RCNY 5-30 [c] [5]). Furthermore, petitioner failed to comply with respondent's notice directing him to immediately forward an invoice showing surrender of his firearms, a notarized letter explaining the incident, and to telephone and speak to the investigator assigned to his case. While petitioner insisted that he was never given an invoice for his firearms and did telephone and inform respondent's investigator that the police had taken his firearms and license, he did not send the notarized letter as directed until five months later.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a CPLR article 78 proceeding commenced by petitioner challenging respondent New York City Police Department's License Division's revocation of his premises residence handgun license, respondent's revocation of the license was in accord with statutory and regulatory procedural requirements, rational and supported by substantial evidence given petitioner's undisputed violation of multiple rules governing the possession of handguns after a domestic incident in his home and the Police Commissioner's broad discretion to revoke licenses to possess handguns when licensees violate those rules. Petitioner failed to demonstrate how respondent's sequence of actions violated any required procedure, failed to provide him an opportunity to respond, or was not entitled to deference. While respondent sent petitioner a final notice--directing him to immediately forward an invoice showing surrender of his firearms and a notarized letter explaining the incident, and to telephone and speak to the investigator assigned to his case--on the same day its investigator issued a final report recommending revocation of petitioner's license, petitioner's prior instances of noncompliance with regulatory requirements, including his failure to immediately notify respondent of the incident and his receipt of an order of protection, and his failure to comply with respondent's previous notice, already constituted a basis for suspending or revoking his license (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;38 RCNY 5-21). Moreover, the investigator's evaluation was not adopted and endorsed until two months later, leaving petitioner with time to comply with the notice before respondent's final determination was made.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Licenses -- Firearms -- Revocation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Respondent New York City Police Department's License Division's determination revoking petitioner's premises residence handgun license was based on an erroneous interpretation of applicable law inasmuch as it considered the fact that at least one of petitioner's handguns was loaded with ammunition, rather than being stored separately from the ammunition, in concluding that petitioner failed to safeguard his firearms. The hearing officer's recommendation, which respondent adopted as its final agency determination, provided that petitioner was required to store his firearms unloaded and secured by trigger lock, with ammunition stored separately, when the firearm was out of his immediate possession and control, citing 38 RCNY 5-22 (a) (13) and Administrative Code of City of NY &sect;10-312. However, neither provision requires storing handguns separately from their ammunition. Moreover, 38 RCNY 5-01 (a)--providing that handguns be kept unloaded and separate from their ammunition when they are being transported--could not be used to support respondent's consideration of the fact that petitioner's handgun was loaded with ammunition, rather than being stored separately from the ammunition, since respondents did not rely on it in defending their decision.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Right to Bear Arms -- Constitutionality of Administrative Code of City of NY &sect;10-312 (a) and 38 RCNY 5-22 (a) (13)--Requirement That Handguns be Rendered Inoperable When out of Owner's Immediate Possession or Control</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Administrative Code of City of NY &sect;10-312 (a) and 38 RCNY 5-22 (a) (13), which make it unlawful for an owner of a handgun &quot;to store or otherwise place or leave such weapon in such a manner or under circumstances that it is out of [the owner's] immediate possession or control, without having rendered such weapon inoperable by employing a safety locking device,&quot; are not unconstitutional under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. Those provisions are only licensing requirements, not an outright or effective ban on handguns or even a restriction severe enough to infringe on Second Amendment rights. The statutory and regulatory terms of section 10-312 (a) and section 5-22 (a) (13) on their face do not dictate, nor did the evidence in the record demonstrate, that lawfully owned firearms be kept inoperable in the home at all times. Instead, the requirement to render a weapon inoperable by employing a safety locking device applies only when the weapon is out of the owner's immediate possession or control. Moreover, petitioner failed to demonstrate that employing a safety locking device in fact prevented his handguns from being readily accessible and operable for his immediate use, as opposed to other unauthorized persons' use, since a handgun's locking device would not inhibit the owner's immediate use in an emergency as he or she would be familiar with the device's unlocking mechanism. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant moved to quash the People's subpoena duces tecum issued to defendant's bank seeking his personal financial records. The motion had to be denied because (1) New York courts did not recognize a criminal defendant's privacy interest in his or her banking records sufficient to provide a defendant standing to move to quash such a subpoena, and (2) an amendment to CPLR 2303(a), requiring service of a copy of a subpoena duces tecum issued in a civil case on other parties to the action, provided no standing, since the legislature did not intend this to apply to criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Evidence -- Third-Party Subpoena Duces Tecum -- Lack of Notice to Defendant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A party to a criminal proceeding is not required to serve a third-party subpoena duces tecum on an opposing party, notwithstanding that CPL 610.40 provides that a subpoena should be served in the manner provided by the CPLR and CPLR 2303 (a) provides that notice of the service of a subpoena duces tecum must be given to all parties, since the relevant legislative histories make clear that the Legislature did not intend to impose such a notice requirement in criminal cases. When the link between the two statutes was initially made, the CPLR did not require notice of subpoenas duces tecum to be made to all parties and section 2303 was only amended years later to so provide; however, the legislative history of the statute's subsequent amendment made it clear that the Legislature was focused on civil, not criminal, proceedings. Therefore, although a plain reading of both statutes would seem to indicate that notice must be provided to a defendant when the People seek a subpoena duces tecum demanding that a financial institution turn over defendant's records, and notwithstanding the maxim that when a general law relating to some subject is incorporated into a particular statute the latter is deemed correspondingly amended by a change in the former, with the authors of the CPL undoubtedly understanding that the CPLR would evolve over time, notice was nevertheless not required to defendant since the single most important principle of statutory construction is that courts should attempt to effectuate the intent of the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- Criminal Defendant's Lack of Standing to Challenge Third-Party Subpoena Duces Tecum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Pursuant to the clear weight of authority in New York and following precedent set forth by the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">United States v Miller</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (425 US 435, 96 S Ct 1619, 48 L Ed 2d 71 [1976]), a criminal defendant has no standing to move to quash a subpoena duces tecum issued by the People to a third-party bank for the defendant's financial records, as personal banking records are business records of a bank in which a depositor has no legitimate expectation of privacy. While a financial institution has little incentive to protect a depositor's privacy, the law effectively provides no clear right for a depositor's legitimate privacy interests to be asserted, much less recognized, at least with respect to an opposing party, any time a person is a party to a civil or criminal proceeding or is being investigated by any one of a myriad of government agencies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was not entitled to withdraw his pleas of guilty to two separate charges of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree (Penal Law &sect; 265.01 [1]) for possessing a gravity knife. Although the court did not specifically ask the defendant during the allocution whether the blade of each knife, which defendant admitted possessing, could be released from the handle and locked in a straight position by the force of gravity or application of centrifugal force, and defendant did not make any such statement, defendant did, when asked by the court whether the knives were &quot;gravity knives,&quot; admit that they were. Moreover, whether defendant knew that the instruments were operable gravity knives was irrelevant. All that was required for guilt in each case--besides proof that the knife was a gravity knife--was defendant's knowledge that he possessed a knife; not that he knew that the knife fit the statutory description of a gravity knife. As the court allocuted the defendant as to all necessary elements of the crime and fully apprised him of the rights and privileges that he would be waiving by guilty pleas, defendant offered his guilty pleas knowingly.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Possession of Weapon -- Gravity Knife </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant was not entitled to withdraw his pleas of guilty to two separate charges of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree (Penal Law &sect; 265.01 [1]) for possessing a gravity knife. Defendant's claim that it was an injustice for him to be convicted of this crime because the knives he possessed were manufactured and sold nationwide as utility tools and not weapons, that they were commonly used by electricians, as he is, or other persons in the building trades, and that he only used the knife for work, not as a weapon, did not constitute a lawful basis for withdrawal of his guilty pleas. In effect, defendant contended that his possession of the knives was lawful because he did so without criminal intent, but there is no such exemption in Penal Law &sect; 265.01 (1). </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Taxpayers failed to establish an actionable violation of their constitutional, equal protection rights, pursuant to N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, where they challenged RPTL art. 18, asserting that there was a growing disconnect between actual class values and the statutory base proportion allocation. The taxpayers failed to show that art. 18, either facially or as applied to them, created invidious disparities among similarly situated taxpayers owning commercial property within the same taxing unit.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Assessment -- Equal Protection -- Fractional Assessments</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff owners of commercial property in Nassau County, a &quot;special assessing unit&quot; (RPTL 1801 [a]), failed to establish that RPTL article 18, under which all real property in a special assessing unit is divided into classes, each taxed at different assessment rates, violated their constitutional equal protection rights on its face or as applied. The Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit multiple tax rates or lines that treat one class differently from others, so long as the difference is not palpably arbitrary or invidiously discriminatory, and the taxes imposed are uniform within a stated class; tax classifications invoke the lowest level of constitutional review. Article 18 was crafted to stabilize relative property tax burdens by assessing real property in each class in reference to its &quot;base proportion,&quot; the proportion of the aggregate value of the property in a class to that of the whole assessing unit, fixed in a prior tax year--here, 1981-1982 (RPTL 1801 [f] [1])--and providing for only certain adjustments and capping annual increases. Regardless of whether each class's share of an assessing unit's overall tax burden accurately reflects current or actual real property values, article 18 rationally furthers the legitimate goals of stabilizing tax burdens and perpetuating minimum class share proportions, and creates no invidious disparities among similarly situated taxpayers within the same assessing unit. Also, plaintiffs failed to establish that differences in the calculation of base proportions in Nassau County and in New York City, allegedly much more reflective of actual property values in New York City, constituted improper discrimination, as they were not even similarly situated with New York City commercial property owners. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A medical center argued that the Department of Health (DOH) wrongfully determined that a nursing home was not eligible to share in a fund created to assist financially disadvantaged nursing homes. The DOH moved to dismiss. As the interpretation adopted by the DOH, which distinguished between article 28-A hospital-based nursing homes, for which it was possible to calculate an operating margin directly from the RHCF-4 reports, and all other hospital-based nursing homes, gave meaning to Public Health Law &sect; 2808(21) and could not be said to be irrational or unreasonable, it was upheld.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. An action seeking a declaratory judgment that defendant Department of Health wrongfully determined that a nursing home operated by plaintiff was not eligible to share in a fund created to assist financially disadvantaged nursing homes and that the statute creating the fund violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions was converted to a hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding/declaratory judgment action. The first two causes of action asserted in the complaint, which were based on allegations that defendant improperly interpreted or applied Public Health Law &sect; 2808 (21), should have been raised in an article 78 proceeding; however, the third cause of action, alleging that the statute was facially unconstitutional, was properly brought as a declaratory judgment action.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding/declaratory judgment action challenging respondent/defendant Department of Health's determination that petitioner/plaintiff's hospital-based nursing home was not eligible to share in a fund created to assist financially disadvantaged nursing homes (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Health Law &sect; 2808 [21]), the disputed statutory language--&quot;[f]or hospital-based residential health care facilities for which an operating margin cannot be calculated on the basis of the submitted cost reports&quot; (&sect; 2808 [21] [c])--required more than interpretation of a statutory term or phrase. It required that respondent determine whether it was, in fact, possible to calculate an operating margin specific to petitioner's nursing home from the data presented on petitioner's institutional cost report (ICR)--a process which required knowledge and understanding of underlying operational practices of the facilities involved and evaluation of the factual data reported on such ICR. As a significant degree of expertise was required to interpret the statute, respondent's interpretation was entitled to deference.  </SPAN></P>

Respondent/defendant Department of Health's determination that a hospital-based nursing home operated by petitioner/plaintiff was not eligible to share in a fund created to assist financially disadvantaged nursing homes pursuant to Public Health Law &sect; 2808 (21) was not irrational or unreasonable. A nursing home's eligibility for additional funds depends on its operating margin, and respondent rationally concluded that only certain non-hospital-based nursing homes that submit their cost reports on specialized forms could have their margins accurately computed. Although it might be technically pos sible to extract information from an institutional cost report (ICR) submitted by the hospital which sponsors a nursing home that would permit calculation of an operating margin, the cost allocation procedure proposed by petitioner, which had submitted an ICR, was not suitable for determining the operating margin because it relied on assumptions to allocate operating revenues and expenses which might not accurately reflect the actual revenues and expenses for the home. Moreover, it would be inappropriate to use data from an ICR for the purpose of attempting to calculate a hospital-based nursing home's operating margin because no adjustment would be made for known differences in the data reported by facilities filing an ICR and those filing the specialized form.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Public Health Law &sect; 2808 (21), as interpreted by respondent/defendant Department of Health to mean that only certain non-hospital-based nursing homes that submit specialized cost reporting forms were eligible for additional state aid, and not hospital-based nursing homes whose costs were reported on the sponsoring hospital's institutional cost report, did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions. The statute enjoyed a strong presumption of constitutionality and was subject to the lowest level of judicial review: the rational basis test. Accordingly, inasmuch as respondent articulated several reasons for treating certain hospital-based nursing homes differently than other nursing homes, namely the differences in the content of their financial reports, the procedure involved with allocating costs between a hospital's acute care facility and its nursing home, and the level of Medicaid payments made to each, and provided reasons why nursing homes may legitimately be treated differently based on their hospital affiliation, the presumption of constitutionality was not overcome. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a proceeding seeking an order pursuant to CPL 330.20 (1) (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">o</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) extending the previous order of conditions of respondent's supervised release, petitioner was not permitted to include a provision in the proposed order that would authorize the temporary confinement of respondent for the purpose of conducting a psychiatric evaluation if a psychiatric professional, in the exercise of his or her professional judgment, concluded that respondent's current psychiatric condition or behavior evidenced an emergence of risk likely to jeopardize respondent's or the public's safety. CPL 330.20, which provides a carefully integrated set of provisions dealing with the procedure to be followed after a verdict or plea of not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect, is intended to be self-contained and to cover all situations relating to the rehospitalization of insanity acquittees, and does not authorize the inclusion of temporary confinement as a part of an order extending the conditions of respondent's supervised release. Such a provision would not be a mere reasonable additional condition to the existing order, and was therefore not authorized by CPL 330.20 (1) (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">o</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), which defines &quot;order of conditions.&quot; Moreover, the proposed extension order contained many provisions to be implemented at the discretion and judgment of psychiatric professionals, and while there would be nothing wrong with such provisions as the basis for taking necessary action either to protect the public or to further respondent's treatment plan, such provisions highlighted the reason for due process hearings: such judgments should be subject to due process review. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner State filed a petition for a finding of dangerousness with respect to respondent inmate and to direct that he be civilly confined pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.06 (k) pending a trial on the matter. The court found, inter alia, that because &sect; 10.06 (k) mandated civil confinement of the inmate after a finding of probable cause and provided no option or alternative for lesser restrictions, due process and the plain language of the statute mandated the inescapable conclusion that it was facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Civil Commitment or Supervision -- Pretrial Confinement </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provision of Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.06 (k) that mandates confinement of a respondent pending trial after a court has made a finding of probable cause to believe that the respondent is a sex offender requiring civil management is facially unconstitutional. The due process protections of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution mandate a specific finding of dangerousness of a respondent in a pretrial detention context, and any such pretrial detention also requires a finding that lesser conditions than confinement would not suffice to protect the community. Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.06 (k), however, does not provide for any such finding. It mandates civil confinement of a respondent after a court's finding that a respondent is a &quot;sex offender requiring civil management&quot;--without any delineation between a &quot;dangerous sex offender requiring confinement&quot; and a &quot;sex offender requiring strict and intensive supervision&quot;--both of which are included in the definition of &quot;sex offender requiring civil management.&quot; (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.03 [q].) Moreover, the statute provides no means to effectuate any finding by a court that lesser conditions than confinement--such as supervision, medication, or community-based treatment--would suffice to protect the community from a respondent pending a civil management trial. Here, less restrictive conditions would have sufficed to protect the public during the pendency of respondent's trial, as the New York State Office of Mental Health had recommended that respondent be released into the community under appropriate supervision and treatment. The court, however, was constrained to order respondent to be released forthwith, as there was no constitutional provision in article 10 authorizing the court to order respondent's detention pending trial after a probable cause finding that respondent is a sex offender requiring civil management, nor one authorizing the court to release respondent under certain terms and conditions. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioners filed special proceedings challenging 48 RCNY 3-82, which adopted new procedures for vacating default judgments. The court found, inter alia, that &sect; 3-82 provided notice prior to a default. There was nothing arbitrary or capricious about notifying the petitioners by first class mail.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Rule Governing Vacatur of Default Judgments -- Elimination of Discretion to Consider Reasons for Default </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A rule of the New York City Environmental Control Board (ECB) providing that defaults would be vacated only if the request for vacatur were received within a certain time frame (48 RCNY 3-82), thereby eliminating the discretion to consider bona fide reasons offered for the default, was neither arbitrary and capricious nor violative of the public policy to have disputes decided on the merits. Administrative rules setting time limits within which to vacate a default are routine, and the 45-day rule adopted by the ECB was not per se arbitrary or capricious. An agency has the discretion to control the means and manner that defaults are vacated and in the absence of legal precedent mandating consideration of discretionary standards, there was no basis to conclude that because the rule in question lacked discretionary considerations, it was arbitrary and capricious. Moreover, notwithstanding the existence of any public policy in favor of determining disputes on their merits, without any violation of a statutory or constitutional right, the court would not direct an agency or other public body to adopt a certain rule or procedure.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Rule Governing Vacatur of Default Judgments -- Time Limits </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. A rule of the New York City Environmental Control Board providing that requests to vacate defaults must be made within 45 days of the hearing at which the respondent failed to appear (48 RCNY 3-82) conflicted on its face with New York City Charter &sect; 1049-a (d) (1) (h), which permits a party to vacate a default within 30 days of the mailing of a notice of default. Inasmuch as there are different triggering events for measuring the default time limits, it would be possible for the 45-day period to have expired before the 30-day period expired if the notice of default was not mailed or mailed 16 or more days after the default actually occurred. Although there is no constitutional or statutory requirement that the triggering date be measured from the time a party actually receives notice of a default, the City Charter requires that the right to vacate a default for good cause be measured from the time a notice of default is mailed. Thus, although 48 RCNY 3-82 is neither arbitrary nor capricious for failing to measure a party's right to vacate a default from the time it receives notice, the rule cannot interfere with a party's right to vacate a default for good cause within 30 days of a mailing of the notice of default.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation- - Rule Governing Vacatur of Default Judgments -- Efficacy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A rule of the New York City Environmental Control Board changing the manner in which default judgments may be vacated (48 RCNY 3-82) was not invalidated on the ground that it allegedly failed to achieve its stated purposes and/or that it would inevitably lead to more litigation. It is not the court's province to review how effectively governmental entities implement their policy objectives, in the absence of some constitutional or statutory violation. Rather, it was sufficient that the rule was rationally related to achieve its stated purpose.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Rule Governing Vacatur of Default Judgments -- Due Process </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A rule of the New York City Environmental Control Board changing the manner in which default judgments may be vacated by setting strict time limits for making an application to vacate (48 RCNY 3-82) facially complied with the constitutional requirement of providing notice prior to a default. Procedural due process requirements must be met before any default is actually taken, and 48 RCNY 3-82 requires that a judgment be vacated where the notice of violation was not properly served in the first place, no matter when the application to vacate on that basis is brought. Thus, arguments about the adequacy of the notice given after the default had been taken did not implicate constitutional violations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Rule Governing Vacatur of Default Judgments -- Traverse Hearing </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The New York City Environmental Control Board (ECB), which recently promulgated a rule changing the manner in which default judgments may be vacated by setting strict time limits for making an application to vacate (48 RCNY 3-82), is not required to hold traverse hearings whenever service of a notice of violation is contested. The boiler plate check-off form developed by the ECB and mandated by 48 RCNY 3-82 gives the applicant ample opportunity to explain and provide proper documentation supporting a claim of improper notice of an underlying violation. An opportunity to be heard is not always equated with the right to a full blown evidentiary hearing. Although the ECB will deny an application to vacate on the ground of disputed service if a valid affidavit of service is in its files, that practice was not a sufficient basis to find the rule facially invalid. As long as any particular party can develop a reviewable record at the administrative level, the issue of whether the ECB improperly rejected a claim of lack of service in any particular case can be decided in a CPLR article 78 proceeding, and the process employed by the ECB allows for the development of a record that incorporates valid information contesting service of the notice of violation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Rule Governing Vacatur of Default Judgments -- Right to Trial </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A rule of the New York City Environmental Control Board changing the manner in which default judgments may be vacated (48 RCNY 3-82) did not conflict with the fundamental right to a trial guaranteed by the New York Constitution. The right to a jury trial is not absolute, but only exists where such right existed in common law as of 1894 or for those cases as are analogous to those which were traditionally tried by a jury at that time. There was no showing that a right to a jury trial existed in the administrative proceedings here or in any matter such as the ones that underlie the petitions challenging the rule.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Rule Governing Vacatur of Default Judgments -- Method of Notifying Defaulters </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The New York City Environmental Control Board (ECB), which promulgated a rule changing the manner in which default judgments may be vacated by setting strict time limits for making an application to vacate (48 RCNY 3-82), did not act arbitrarily and capriciously by sending default notices by first-class mail as opposed to electronic communication or in person. New York City Charter &sect; 1049-a (d) (1) (h) expressly requires that the ECB send a notice of default out to parties by first-class mail before a judgment can be docketed against them. The ECB should not be compelled to use modern technology in connection with notifying parties of defaults, as the manner of notice is usually a matter of policy and discretion that will not be attacked unless it otherwise violates a constitutional or established statutory right, and neither a constitutional nor statutory violation was involved with the ECB's notification procedures.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Rule Governing Vacatur of Default Judgments -- Method of Notifying Defaulters </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The use of an electronic database was a reliable method of obtaining information about where to mail notifications to parties who defaulted in appearing before the New York City Environmental Control Board (ECB), which is charged with adjudicating summonses issued to those allegedly violating pollution and/or quality of life laws and regulations. Since all of the petitioners in the proceeding here to challenge a rule promulgated by the ECB changing the manner in which defaults may be vacated initially defaulted, the ECB did not have notices of appearances or other designated addresses at which to notify them. The database appeared to be a reasonable and logical choice for the ECB to find petitioners' contact information. The methodology chosen was not arbitrary or capricious, even though in any particular case, the contact information used might be attacked as insufficient--at least to the extent that such notification was used as the triggering event for the 30 days in which to request vacating a default for good cause.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Rule Governing Vacatur of Default Judgments -- Adjustment Period </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. A rule of the New York City Environmental Control Board changing the manner in which default judgments may be vacated (48 RCNY 3-82) was not invalid on the ground that defaulters were given no time to &quot;adjust&quot; to the new rule. The rule was not applied retroactively and was under consideration for at least six months before it was adopted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Rule Governing Vacatur of Default Judgments -- Maximum Fine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The New York City Environmental Control Board (ECB), which is charged with adjudicating summonses issued to those who allegedly violate pollution and/or quality of life laws and regulations, did not improperly punish those who defaulted in appearing before the ECB by entering the default judgments against them in the maximum amounts allowed by law. The authority to enter such judgment amounts was expressly contained in the New York City Charter (NY City Charter &sect; 1049-a [d] [1] [d]). Thus, a rule of the ECB changing the manner whereby default judgments may be vacated (48 RCNY 3-82) could not be attacked for implementing what its enabling authority required.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Process -- Service of Process -- Administrative Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The New York City Environmental Control Board properly denied petitioner's request to vacate a default judgment entered against her where petitioner alleged that she never received a notice of violation, since petitioner was validly served by an inspector for the Department of Environmental Protection who, after four unsuccessful attempts to serve petitioner personally, affixed a copy of the violation to the door of the place of occurrence and thereafter mailed a copy to that same place. The inspector subsequently mailed a copy to petitioner at her last known address as reflected in the available records and service was also made by mail at another address. Therefore, service comported with the legal requirements as one of those addresses was in fact petitioner's last known address.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments - Default Judgment -- Vacatur -- Administrative Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. In a proceeding to vacate a default before the New York City Environmental Control Board (ECB), the ECB did not act arbitrarily by refusing to consider whether petitioner's default was excusable, as it had validly promulgated a rule eliminating that discretionary based reason to vacate a default and providing instead that defaults would only be vacated if a timely application therefor were made. As there was no dispute that petitioner did not make her application to vacate her default within the required 30 days of mailing of any notice to her of the default, she was not entitled to have her application to vacate considered on the basis of &quot;good cause.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Process -- Service of Process -- Administrative Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. In a proceeding to vacate a default before the New York City Environmental Control Board (ECB), service of notice of the underlying proceeding was properly made, in accordance with New York City Charter &sect; 1049-a, by a posting of the violation at the place of occurrence and a mailing thereafter to the premises, with additional copies mailed to the addresses that various municipal agencies had on file for the owner or agent of the premises. Although the City Charter also permits service to be made in accordance with article 3 of the CPLR, those are merely permissible alternate methods of service, and are not mandated to the exclusion of other permissible modes of service. Moreover, there was otherwise no legal basis for the petition to review the ECB's denial of petitioner's application to vacate the default: inasmuch as there was nothing inherently arbitrary about the ECB setting 45 days as the time period to make an application to vacate a default, petitioner's failure to come within that time line was sufficient reason to deny the application.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Default Judgment -- Vacatur -- Administrative Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. An application to vacate a default before the New York City Environmental Control Board (ECB) was granted to the extent of remanding the matter back to the ECB for it to consider if petitioner was entitled to have its default vacated under New York City Charter &sect; 1049-a (d) (1) (h), where it was unclear when the notice of default was mailed, and whether the notice of default was mailed to petitioner at the correct address and/or under the correct name. Although petitioner applied for relief from the default less than 30 days after having notice of it, the ECB did not consider this application under the &quot;good cause&quot; standard that is afforded those applicants who seek to vacate a default within 30 days of mailing of the notice of default, and it did not consider whether the notice of default was properly mailed to either the correct party or the correct address. Accordingly, the matter was remanded. </SPAN></P>

Defendants statements, though vulgar and vituperative in nature, did not rise to the level of fighting words or to the level of a true threat. They were, in fact, constitutionally protected speech.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioners taxi operators brought a hybrid proceeding pursuant to CPLR art. 78 to review a respondent city council's adoption of an ordinance regulating taxis and sought a declaration under CPLR 3001 that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The operators moved for summary judgment, and respondents, city officials, city council, and the city, cross-moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The operators said respondents could not mandate uniform vehicle colors. The claim failed because nothing showed the city had no reasonable basis for the requirement. The operators did not show the ordinance resulted in an unconstitutional taking because (1) it raised fares, and (2) they did not account for fares not subject to the ordinance. They did not show the ordinance illegally delegated authority to the police chief because (1) the provisions in issue were rationally based, not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, and provided reasonable standards in the areas of licensing, inspection, and fare disputes, and (2) nothing showed the provisions gave no reasonable notice of proscribed conduct or were vague. A limit on the length of a taxi driver's shift was not improper because it was rationally based and related to the health, safety and welfare of passengers and the public. The operators did not show General Municipal Law &sect; 181 preempted the ordinance because the statute let the city regulate its taxicab industry, and neither conflict nor field preemption applied. They did not show limits on a taxi's age were improper because the limits were related to public safety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The operators' summary judgment motion was denied, and respondents' summary judgment motion was granted. The contested ordinance was declared to be valid, constitutional, and enforceable as enacted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Taxicab Business -- Intracity Fares Set at Certain Rates</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. City of Newburgh Ordinance No. 3-2008 (as amended by Ordinance No. 11-2010), which sets forth a scheme for municipal regulation of taxicab services and taxi drivers operating within the City of Newburgh that includes setting intracity fares at certain rates, does not result in an unconstitutional taking under the New York State and United States Constitutions. Petitioners alleged that it costs over $20 per hour to operate a taxicab, that drivers typically perform four trips per hour, and that the intracity fares of $5, $2.50 for a senior citizen, and $1 per five-minute wait time prevent petitioners from making a profit. Petitioners failed, however, to address the fact that the ordinance actually raised fares from $3 to $5, or account for the possibility of securing other than intracity fares which would not be subject to the $5 fare set by the ordinance. Accordingly, petitioners failed to show that the ordinance denies them all economically beneficial use of their property, or a deprivation significant enough to satisfy the heavy burden on someone alleging a regulatory taking.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Taxicab Business  Delegation of Authority to Chief of Police and Other City Officials</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The delegation of authority to the Chief of Police and other city officials in the areas of taxicab licensing, inspection, and fare disputes as provided for in City of Newburgh Ordinance No. 3-2008 (as amended by Ordinance No. 11-2010), which sets forth a scheme for municipal regulation of taxicab services and taxi drivers operating within the City of Newburgh, is constitutionally valid. Although a legislature cannot delegate its lawmaking functions to other bodies, there is no constitutional prohibition against the delegation of power to an agency or commission to administer the laws promulgated by the legislature provided that power is circumscribed by reasonable safeguards and standards. The ordinance provisions challenged by petitioners here are rationally based, not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, and provide reasonable safeguards, standards and guidelines in the areas of licensing, inspection, and fare disputes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Taxicab Business -- 12-Hour Shift Limitation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Code of the City of Newburgh &sect; 272-16 (E) (12) (now section 272-17 [E] [12]), which limits a driver from operating a taxicab more than 12 hours in any continuous 24-hour period, except the driver of a taxicab exclusively hired or engaged for special trips or excursions, is not arbitrary and capricious. A 12-hour shift limitation is rationally based and relates to the health, safety and welfare of both taxicab passengers and the public at large. Both groups might be endangered by fatigued taxi drivers operating their taxicabs for more than 12 hours in any continuous 24-hour period, and the attendant danger of a driver falling asleep at the wheel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Taxicab Business -- Local Ordinance Not Preempted by State Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. City of Newburgh Ordinance No. 3-2008 (as amended by Ordinance No. 11-2010), which sets forth a scheme for municipal regulation of taxicab services and taxi drivers operating within the City of Newburgh, was not preempted by General Municipal Law &sect; 181, the statute that empowers cities, towns, and villages to enact ordinances regulating the registration and licensing of taxicabs. Rather, General Municipal Law &sect; 181 gives respondent City of Newburgh the ability and authority to regulate its own taxicab industry consistent with the State Constitution and state statutes. The ordinance fell within the local regulatory oversight envisioned by General Municipal Law &sect; 181. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant/respondent Comptroller of the County of Nassau was authorized by Nassau County Charter &sect; 402 (6) to audit a park district of plaintiff/petitioner Town of North Hempstead, a municipal corporation and political subdivision of the State. While NY Constitution, article V, &sect; 1, as implemented by the Legislature in General Municipal Law &sect;&sect; 33 and 34, authorizes the State Comptroller to supervise the accounts and financial affairs of the State's municipal corporations, Nassau County Charter &sect; 402 (6), also enacted by the Legislature, authorizes the County Comptroller to examine and audit the accounts and records of any town or special district. Whether the Town's park district is an administrative department of the Town or a special district as defined in RPTL 102 (16), the County Comptroller has the authority to audit it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Counties -- Comptroller -- Auditing Authority Concurrent with State Comptroller</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant/respondent Comptroller of the County of Nassau could properly audit a park district of plaintiff/petitioner Town of North Hempstead, a municipal corporation and political subdivision of the State, despite the State Comptroller's overlapping auditing authority, as the State and County Comptrollers have concurrent authority. State preemption occurs either when a local government adopts a law that directly conflicts with a state statute or when a local government legislates in a field for which the State Legislature has assumed full regulatory responsibility. Moreover, Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 11 (1) (g) precludes legislative bodies from adopting a local law which supersedes a state statute if such local law &quot;[a]pplies to or affects powers of the State Comptroller in relation to auditing or examining municipal accounts&quot; or related matters. However, the State Comptroller has audit jurisdiction in many areas where a local comptroller also shares that authority, and nothing in the State Constitution or General Municipal Law &sect;&sect; 33 or 34, which address the State Comptroller's powers and duties, indicates an intent of the State Legislature to limit auditing of municipal corporations, political subdivisions or special districts exclusively to the State Comptroller, nor does the exercise of concurrent auditing powers conflict with or impede the authority of the State Comptroller. </SPAN></P>

Supreme Court had the authority to transfer to its Integrated Domestic Violence (IDV) Part defendant's prosecution under an accusatory instrument charging only a violation level domestic violence offense, i.e., a petty offense, to be tried along with other pending matters transferred from Family Court and also involving defendant and complainant and the underlying issue of domestic violence. Supreme Court has the constitutional authority to transfer to itself any action or proceeding, including a sole count of a violation level offense, upon a finding that such transfer will promote the administration of justice (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 19 [a]). The IDV Part was created by the Chief Judge pursuant to constitutional and legislative authority (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 28 [c]; Judiciary Law &sect; 211 [1] [a]), and was granted broad authority to transfer a domestic violence case pending in criminal court and a simultaneously pending civil family case involving the same parties or family for disposition in the IDV Part (22 NYCRR part 41). Nothing in the language of part 41 limits the IDV Part's transfer authority to only misdemeanor and felony level offenses. Thus, the provisions of CPL 210.05 limiting superior court prosecutions to those charged by indictment or superior court information do not apply to the IDV Part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Jurisdiction -- Supreme Court Integrated Domestic Violence Part</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Supreme Court Integrated Domestic Violence Part had subject matter jurisdiction over defendant's prosecution under an accusatory instrument charging only a violation level domestic violence offense, i.e., a petty offense, transferred to that court along with pending Family Court matters also involving defendant and complainant and the underlying issue of domestic violence. Pursuant to New York Constitution, article VI, &sect; 7 (a), Supreme Court has general original jurisdiction in law and equity, which jurisdictional power is unlimited and unqualified. While the provisions of the CPL generally contemplate that violations and misdemeanors will be tried in local criminal courts, any effort by the Legislature to deprive Supreme Court of the broad jurisdiction would be unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1198(5), which required him to pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device after he was found guilty of driving under the influence. The appellate court found, inter alia, that existing statutory, regulatory, and case law provided defendant with both equal protection of the law and due process. Therefore, the lack of a definition of indigence in &sect; 1198(5) was not constitutionally significant. Accordingly, the law was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect;1198, which requires defendants convicted of driving while intoxicated to pay the cost of installing and maintaining ignition interlock devices, was not rendered unconstitutional by the fact that the interlock's cost was not set by statute. Defendant had notice of the interlock requirements, including the responsibility for payment. That the specific amount was not mentioned was not constitutionally significant since the regulation promulgated pursuant to statute provides a mechanism whereby a defendant can alert the court to a claim of economic hardship (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;9 NYCRR 358.8 [b]), and any due process concerns involving a defendant's ability to bear the cost is addressed at the time of sentencing. Moreover, once classified as a fine, CPL 420.10 (5) provides a mechanism for a defendant to obtain post-sentencing modification of an order to pay the cost of the interlock, and any modification determination, including alternative sentencing options, is constrained by due process and equal protection considerations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Statute -- Cost of Installation and Maintenance of Ignition Interlock Devices </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect;1198, which requires defendants convicted of driving while intoxicated to pay the cost of installing and maintaining ignition interlock devices unless a court determines in a particular case that the defendant cannot afford the cost, was not rendered unconstitutional by the Legislature's failure to provide a definition of indigence.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Statute -- Requirement That Ignition Interlock Devices be Installed on All Vehicles Owned by Defendant </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect;1198, which requires defendants convicted of driving while intoxicated to pay the cost of installing and maintaining ignition interlock devices, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause by requiring wealthier defendants who have more than one vehicle to pay more than defendants who have only one vehicle. A wealthier defendant's interest does not involve a suspect classification. Moreover, the classification is related to a legitimate governmental purpose as the statute seeks to protect the public at large from the possibility that an individual who has been convicted of driving while intoxicated will operate a motor vehicle in an intoxicated condition again. To arbitrarily limit the application of the law to one vehicle per defendant would lead to the circumstance where a defendant with the financial ability to do so would obtain more than one vehicle, one to comply with the law and the second to flaunt it, which neither the Constitution nor logic mandate as a result. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A petition contending that respondent was a detained sex offender who had a mental abnormality as that term is defined in Mental Hygiene Law article 10 was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where respondent committed an additional offense after the proceeding was commenced and would not be subject to release from prison for two more years. The relief sought, civil management, was too remote and could not be granted even if a jury were to find that respondent currently suffered from a mental abnormality. There could be no immediate consequence to any determination that respondent currently should be subject to the strictures of civil management as he could not be civilly managed. Any determination as to respondent's mental condition would not only be speculative and/or hypothetical as to what his condition would be at such time as he would be subject to civil management, it also would be inconsistent with the intent and requirement of the statute, which include treatment for an offender's mental abnormality and protection of the public. Moreover, there was no authority to adjourn the dispositional phase of the proceeding until respondent would be nearing his release date. </SPAN></P>

As the mother did not request a hearing within 21 days after service of the notice of termination, her claims were barred due to her failure to exhaust her administrative remedies.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding challenging respondent agency's termination of petitioner mother's and daughter's Section 8 housing subsidy, the claims of petitioner mother, the head of household for purposes of the voucher, were barred by her failure to exhaust administrative remedies, even though the notice of termination and of the right to a hearing, which she failed to timely request, was sent to the address of the subsidized apartment rather than her current address and the agency had prior notice that she had moved. Due process requires the government to provide notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of an action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. Here, during the pendency of petitioners' annual Section 8 recertification, the mother sought to replace herself with her daughter, a member of the household acknowledged by the agency, as head of household so the daughter could retain the voucher, in light of the mother's relocation. Although the agency had prior notice that the mother had moved, service was sufficient under the circumstances, as she had continued to respond to requests that the agency sent to her at the subsidized apartment even after she moved, and, as of the date of service of the notice of termination, she remained the tenant of record of the apartment as well as the designated head of household in the voucher.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding challenging respondent agency's termination of petitioner mother's and daughter's Section 8 housing subsidy, the claims of petitioner daughter, a member of the household acknowledged by the agency but not the head of household, were not barred by a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, as she was not served with the notice of termination and right to a hearing, and had no opportunity in her own right to challenge the termination administratively, although she had an independent claim of right to the voucher. During the pendency of petitioners' annual Section 8 recertification, petitioner mother, the head of household for purposes of the voucher, sought to replace herself with her daughter as head of household so the daughter could retain the voucher following the mother's planned move from the subsidized apartment. Based on purported deficiencies in the recertification, the agency ultimately terminated the voucher but served notice on the mother only. Even though the daughter was not the head of household, and regardless of whether she was specifically entitled to notice of the termination, she had an independent right to challenge the termination and show her entitlement under federal law to succeed to the voucher as a remaining family member, and would have been entitled to do so even if the mother had not attempted to transfer head of household status through the agency and had simply vacated the apartment. Considering that the purpose of the Section 8 program is to provide benefits to families as a whole, and that the federal regulatory framework protects remaining family members, the daughter had a right to challenge the termination of the subsidy and could not be found in a worse position, in terms of her right to remain in her home and continue to receive the subsidy, as a result of the mother's attempting to follow agency procedures for transfer of the subsidy rather than simply moving out of the apartment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Housing -- Rent Subsidy -- Termination of Section 8 Subsidy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Respondent agency's termination of petitioners' Section 8 rent subsidy was &quot;shockingly disproportionate&quot; to petitioners' offense, and thus an abuse of discretion, where, at worst, in the context of petitioners' annual recertification and in the course of several interactions over several months, they produced insufficient pay stubs for income verification and failed to produce a letter from the landlord. An agency determination imposing a penalty will be set aside as an abuse of discretion if the measure of punishment or discipline imposed is so disproportionate to the offense, in the light of all the circumstances, as to be shocking to one's sense of fairness. Here, in addition to the minor nature of the shortcomings of petitioners' recertification, they did not misreport income or family composition to the agency or obtain any benefit to which they were not entitled. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A CPLR art. 78 petition was granted as the application of Executive Law &sect; 259-c(14) to a parolee violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The 77-year-old parolee's apartment fell within the geographic restriction of &sect; 259-c(1) and Penal Law &sect; 220.00(14). Almost all homes in Manhattan fell within the geographic restriction. A proposed residence in Brooklyn had been disapproved, and the parolee's placement in the Bronx was problematic. The parolee was a first-time offender, and was a low-risk, level 1 sex offender. The lack of individual assessment made the statute punitive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petition is granted. Matter remanded to parole division.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Sexual Assault Reform Act -- Ex Post Facto Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive Law &sect; 259-c (14) (as amended by L 2005, ch 544), which prohibits paroled sex offenders whose victims were children from entering &quot;school grounds&quot; as defined in Penal Law &sect; 220.00 (14), was an unconstitutional ex post facto law as applied to petitioner, a 77-year-old paroled level one sex offender who had committed his sex offense before the effective date of the amendment and was prohibited from living in his Manhattan apartment or anywhere in Manhattan since &quot;school grounds&quot; include a 1,000-foot buffer zone around any school property. At the time petitioner committed his offense the Sexual Assault Reform Act, codified in part as Executive Law &sect; 259-c (14), prohibited paroled sex offenders whose victims were children from entering &quot;school grounds&quot; as defined in paragraph (a) of Penal Law &sect; 220.00 (14). The amendment to Executive Law &sect; 259-c (14) eliminated the reference to paragraph (a) and thereby incorporated Penal Law &sect; 220.00 (14) in its entirety into Executive Law &sect; 259-c (14), including the 1,000-foot buffer zone. The legislative history of the amendment indicated that the Legislature had a dual purpose: to protect children and increase punishment against convicted sex offenders. The definition of &quot;school grounds&quot; is found, significantly, in the Penal Law and applies only to individuals who are on parole, which is a form of punishment. Moreover, the result of the amendment was punitive, effectively banishing petitioner from Manhattan, where he has lived most of his life. Accordingly, applying the amendment to petitioner, an elderly low-level first time sex offender suffering health problems, was punitive given that there had been no individualized assessment of the potential risk petitioner posed to children, and, consequently, was a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accusatory instrument charging defendant with sleeping inside a sleeping bag on top of a number of blankets and cardboard boxes on a public sidewalk in violation of Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 16-122 (b) was facially insufficient. Administrative Code &sect; 16-122 (b) prohibits any person, such person's agent or employee from leaving various types of movable property or erecting &quot;a shed, building or other obstruction&quot; on a street or public place. The accusatory instrument here was devoid of any facts which gave reasonable cause to believe that defendant left any property on the sidewalk. Further, the makeshift mattress of cardboard boxes upon which defendant was allegedly sleeping could not reasonably be called a &quot;shed&quot; or &quot;building.&quot; Although the makeshift bed could be seen as an &quot;obstruction,&quot; there were no factual allegations which supported a contention that the makeshift bed, located in a commercial district of the city at 10:15 p.m., blocked anyone from passing along the sidewalk or using that few square feet of sidewalk for any other lawful purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's motion to dismiss was denied as Penal Law &sect; 120.05(12) was constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. amend. V and XIV. Since age was not a suspect classification, it was not entitled to the strict scrutiny standard of review, but was subject to a rational basis standard of review. In enacting Penal Law &sect; 120.05(12), the New York legislature had concerns about protecting the elderly who were particularly susceptible to crimes of violence as a result of their age, which was a legitimate state interest. Section 120.05(12) effectuated that interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Assault -- Constitutionality of Penal Law &sect; 120.05 (12) -- Equal Protection </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Penal Law &sect; 120.05 (12), which provides that a person is guilty of assault in the second degree when, among other things, he or she causes physical injury to a victim who is 65 years of age or older and he or she is more than 10 years younger than the victim, does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Since age is not a suspect classification, the age provision is subject only to the rational basis standard of review, which tests whether the Legislature was protecting a legitimate state interest in enacting the statute. Here, the statute was enacted to protect senior citizens, who are generally more vulnerable to injury and less able to protect themselves than younger persons, and the statute protects that legitimate interest.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Assault -- Constitutionality of Penal Law &sect; 120.05 (12) -- Facial Challenge for Overbreadth</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Penal Law &sect;120.05 (12), which provides that a person is guilty of assault in the second degree when, among other things, he or she causes physical injury to a victim who is 65 years of age or older and he or she is more than 10 years younger than the victim, is not facially unconstitutional as overbroad. A party mounting a facial constitutional challenge bears the substantial burden of demonstrating that in any degree and in every conceivable application, the law suffers wholesale constitutional impairment. Here, the statute is clear in its application and can be applied constitutionally. Simply because Penal Law &sect; 120.05 (12) is a strict liability statute with respect to the age elements does not render the statute overbroad, as a variety of strict liability statutes in New York impose criminal liability regardless of knowledge of the victim's age.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Penal Law &sect; 120.05 (12), which provides that a person is guilty of assault in the second degree when, among other things, he or she causes physical injury to a victim who is 65 years of age or older and he or she is more than 10 years younger than the victim, is not arbitrary and capricious in deeming individuals age 65 or older to be in need of enhanced protection under the Penal Law. In order for a law to be arbitrary and capricious, it must be founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact and lack a rational basis. Here, the Legislature's goal was to protect individuals age 65 and older, who may suffer deteriorating physical capabilities, from assault by younger, more physically able persons, and its determination that such persons need additional protection is reasonable. Nor is the statute arbitrary on the ground that it does not apply to offenders once they reach age 65, as the purpose is to protect the elderly from younger, more physically capable individuals.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Assault -- Constitutionality of Penal Law &sect; 120.05 (12) -- Vagueness</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Penal Law &sect; 120.05 (12), which provides that &quot;[a] person is guilty of assault in the second degree when ... [w]ith intent to cause physical injury to a person who is sixty-five years of age or older, he or she causes such injury to such person, and the actor is more than ten years younger than such person,&quot; is not unconstitutionally vague. A statute is vague if it is not sufficiently precise and clear as to its coverage. Here, the legislative history establishes that liability does not require proof that a defendant knew or had reason to know of the victim's age, and the Legislature made clear that proof of such knowledge is not required.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Assault -- Constitutionality of Penal Law &sect; 120.05 (12) as Applied </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Penal Law &sect; 120.05 (12), which provides that a person is guilty of assault in the second degree when, among other things, he or she causes physical injury to a victim who is 65 years of age or older and he or she is more than 10 years younger than the victim, was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant, despite his contention that he neither targeted the elderly nor was motivated by the victim's age. The statute addresses &quot;predatory attacks&quot; on senior citizens, but its application is not limited to such attacks. Here, at the time of the assault, defendant was 47 years old and the victim was 68 years old, both satisfying the statute's age requirements. </SPAN></P>

Where the wife was a homemaker and the husband made over $ 500,000 per year income, after consideration of the Domestic Relations Law &sect; 236 factors, the blind application of the mathematical formula for temporary maintenance was unjust and inappropriate as the sums paid for carrying charges were no longer available as a maintenance source.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Divorce -- No-Fault Divorce </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff wife's motion for partial summary judgment on her cause of action for divorce on the ground that the relationship between the parties was irretrievably broken for a period of at least six months pursuant to Domestic Relations Law &sect; 170 (7) was denied and the court's order directing a bifurcated trial on fault grounds was recalled and vacated where all the financial issues between the parties had not been resolved. While the Legislature did not intend for nor is there a defense to section 170 (7) and the court would normally grant partial summary judgment to the movant where there are no defenses and no triable issues of fact, a motion for partial summary judgment cannot be granted nor can a bifurcated trial be held with respect thereto as the statute directs that a judgment of divorce may not be &quot;granted&quot; when the cause of action is predicated on the no-fault ground until the economic issues and custody and visitation have been resolved (Domestic Relations Law &sect; 170 [7]). Moreover, since there is no defense to the no-fault ground, no judicial economy would be served by having a bifurcated trial on fault grounds, the only purpose of which would be to determine whether a divorce would be granted in the first instance, as a divorce would be granted in this case provided the matter proceeded to its expected conclusion.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Support - Maintenance -- Calculation of Temporary Maintenance Award </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a divorce action in which plaintiff wife sought temporary maintenance, the blind application of the mathematical formula for temporary maintenance pursuant to Domestic Relations Law &sect;236 (B) (5-a) was unjust and inappropriate after consideration of the statutory factors set forth in section 236 (B) (5-a) (e) (1) as the sums paid by defendant for carrying charges at the marital residence were no longer available as a maintenance source. In keeping with the mandate of the statute, but limiting its reach to only disposable income, a recomputation after deducting the carrying charges of $7,274 per month from defendant's income yielded a presumptively correct amount of temporary maintenance of $10,897 per month.  </SPAN></P>

In determining temporary child support, the court, in its discretion, may apply the Child Support Standards Act standards and guidelines, which according to plaintiff would have resulted in a child support obligation of $9,221 per month, but it is not required to do so. Here, the temporary child support of $3,000 per month represented defendant's share of the children's reasonable monthly needs for food, clothing, transportation, school supplies, laundry, recreation and miscellaneous.   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Nassau County, New York, Interim Finance Agency (NIFA) imposed a control period on the County pursuant to Public Authorities Law &sect; 3669(1). The County and an executive sought relief therefrom. There was an insufficient showing on the unconstitutionality of the control period statute of &sect; 3669, as the NIFA Act did not have to be re-enacted under N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(b)(1) based on Legislative Law &sect; 55 and the Statute of Local Governments &sect; 11(2). A claim that the NIFA decision was arbitrary and capricious was a viable claim that survived dismissal motions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Authorities -- Nassau County Interim Finance Authority -- Constitutionality of Control Period</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The control period imposed by respondent Nassau County Interim Finance Authority (NIFA) upon petitioner Nassau County pursuant to Public Authorities Law &sect; 3669 (1) (b) on the ground that there existed a substantial likelihood and imminence of petitioner incurring a major operating fund deficit of one percent or more in the aggregate results of operations during 2011 was constitutional. Although the interim finance period, during which respondent was required to approve or disapprove petitioner's budget and current year financial plans (Public Authorities Law &sect; 3651 [14]), expired in 2008, it was not necessary that Public Authorities Law &sect; 3669 be reenacted by the Legislature in accordance with NY Constitution, article IX, &sect; 2 (b) (1). The NIFA Act (L 2000, ch 84), enacted in 2000 pursuant to a home rule message prepared by the County Executive and approved by the County Legislature, was enacted pursuant to section 2 (b) (2), and not section 2 (b) (1), of article IX of the NY Constitution. Any special law enacted pursuant to the home rule message of NY Constitution, article IX, &sect; 2 (b) (2) becomes power reserved to the State Legislature under  Statute of Local Governments &sect;11 (2). Accordingly, the NIFA Act's mandates upon petitioner were specifically excluded from the powers granted to petitioner by the Statute of Local Governments, and there was no requirement that any part of the NIFA Act had to be reenacted under NY Constitution, article IX, &sect; 2 (b) (1).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Authorities -- Nassau County Interim Finance Authority -- Imposition of Control Period </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent Nassau County Interim Finance Authority had the authority to impose a control period in 2011 upon petitioner Nassau County pursuant to Public Authorities Law &sect; 3669 (1) (b) on the ground that there existed a substantial likelihood and imminence of petitioner incurring a major operating fund deficit of one percent or more in the aggregate results of operations during 2011. Although the interim finance period, during which respondent was required to approve or disapprove petitioner's budget and current year financial plans (Public Authorities Law &sect; 3651 [14]), expired in 2008, there was no requirement that the control period be exercised by respondent only during the interim finance period. Respondent's authority that expired in 2008 was the authority to conduct an annual audit, and to issue new debt obligations on behalf of petitioner. Petitioner's obligation to submit a four-year plan and annual reports to respondent also expired. However, petitioner still had an obligation to provide quarterly reports to respondent while bonds remained outstanding, and respondent's authority to declare a control period under Public Authorities Law &sect; 3669 (1) continue while the bonds remained outstanding.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Authorities -- Nassau County Interim Finance Authority -- Imposition of Control Period </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a proceeding challenging as arbitrary and capricious the determination of respondent Nassau County Interim Finance Authority imposing a control period upon petitioner Nassau County pursuant to Public Authorities Law &sect; 3669 (1) (b) on the ground that there existed a substantial likelihood and imminence of the County incurring a major operating fund deficit of one percent or more in the aggregate results of operations during 2011, petitioner was not entitled to injunctive relief as it failed to sufficiently establish a likelihood of success on the merits, and it was questionable whether petitioner would sustain irreparable harm absent injunctive relief. Petitioner's budget totalled $2.7 billion so a $27 million deficit would require respondent's imposition of a control period. Respondent's conclusion that the budget contained $244.4 million in risky revenue and savings was grounded in sound accounting practice. Petitioner's ability in prior years to avert the consequences of revenue and savings deficits that respondent had found at risk and to end with a balance budget did not establish that it was likely that it would be successful in doing so in 2011, and it did not establish that respondent's projection was unfounded. A balancing of the equities tipped in favor of respondent. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff insurer, alleging it was subrogated to the rights of its insured, moved for a default judgment against defendant motorist due to his failure to file an answer. Although the insurer filed the action over two years after the motorist's accident with the insured, its papers were silent as to whether its insured filed her own lawsuit against motorist. Therefore, the viability of its claim to recoup first party benefits was not clear under Insurance Law &sect; 5104(b), and it was thus not entitled to a default judgment as to that claim.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Jurisdiction -- Monetary Limit of District Court -- Separate Causes of Action Joined in Single Complaint</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. District Court had jurisdiction over plaintiff's action even though it was comprised of two causes of action which, in the aggregate, sought damages of $21,000. Monetary claims brought in District Court are ordinarily limited to cases where the amount sought to be recovered does not exceed $15,000 (UDCA 202). However, unlike County Court's jurisdictional limit, which applies to the entire complaint rather than each cause of action, where several causes of action are asserted in the same complaint in District Court and each of them would be within the jurisdiction of the court if sued upon separately, the court has jurisdiction of the action (UDCA 211).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Jurisdiction -- Monetary Limit of District Court -- Distinct Causes of Action Arising from Single Transaction or Occurrence</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. District Court had jurisdiction over plaintiff insurer's action, as subrogee, seeking damages of $21,000 in the aggregate, as the complaint properly asserted two causes of action, each of which was within the court's $15,000 jurisdictional limit (UDCA 211), even though both causes of action involved only one wrong by defendant--the negligent operation of a motor vehicle. Although a lower court's jurisdictional limits cannot be circumvented by the simple expedient of splitting a claim into separately stated &quot;causes of action,&quot; distinct causes of action may arise from a single transaction or occurrence. Where, as here, a single wrongful act caused injury to both the person and property of another, distinct causes of action arose. While both claims were asserted by plaintiff subrogee under the provisions of the same insurance policy and based on the same occurrence, the first cause of action, to recoup basic first-party no-fault benefits, involved &quot;economic losses&quot; (e.g., medical expenses), whereas the second cause of action, for supplementary uninsured motorist benefits, involved payments for the insured's pain and suffering.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- No-Fault Automobile Insurance -- Action by or on Behalf of Covered Person against Noncovered Person -- Plaintiff Insurer Must Allege Whether Insured Commenced Separate Lawsuit</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an action by plaintiff insurer to recoup basic no-fault benefits paid to its insured from defendant, a noncovered person under no-fault who was in a motor vehicle accident with plaintiff's insured, plaintiff was not entitled to a default judgment because, although plaintiff provided proof of the default, plaintiff's papers were silent as to whether its insured commenced her own lawsuit against defendant and, thus, failed to allege sufficient facts establishing a legally viable cause of action. While the complaint and affidavits included a sufficient allegation that defendant was not a &quot;covered person,&quot; equally essential is an allegation that plaintiff's insured failed to commence a lawsuit of her own seeking damages for personal injuries (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Insurance Law &sect; 5104 [b]). If such action had been brought, the insurer's remedies would be limited to lien rights against any recovery by the insured. On the other hand, if the insured had commenced no action within two years after accrual of a claim, then, and only then, would the insurer have a cause of action for the amount of first-party benefits paid to its insured.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In an action by plaintiff insurer, pursuant to Insurance Law &sect; 3420 (f) (2), to recoup supplementary uninsured motorist benefits paid to its insured in settlement of her claim for pain and suffering, plaintiff was not entitled to a default judgment against defendant uninsured motorist because, although plaintiff provided proof of the default, plaintiff neither properly pleaded nor proved by party affidavit that its insured suffered a &quot;serious injury&quot; under the No-Fault Law (Insurance Law &sect; 5102 [d]). An insurer suing a noncovered person upon a subrogated claim for supplementary uninsured motorist benefits should be required to plead and prove the insured's serious injury in order to obtain a judgment against the uninsured motorist. An insured could not obtain payment of uninsured motorist benefits for pain and suffering without proof of serious injury and, to the extent an insurer acquires subrogation rights by paying supplementary uninsured motorist benefits pursuant Insurance Law &sect; 3420 (f), such payments are properly made only in cases involving serious injuries. Here, the complaint included no factual allegations that satisfied the definition of &quot;serious injury,&quot; and the medical records submitted did not suffice under the circumstances, since no effort was made to show how they demonstrated that plaintiff's insured had sustained a serious injury. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court dismissed an information charging defendant with an Administrative Code of the City of NY &sect; 20-453 violation for facial insufficiency since the condoms wrapped in political messages sold fell within the written matter exception. The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs had construed the written matter exception to apply to items bearing political messages falling within the same category as the condoms. A reasonable consumer of these condoms was unlikely to purchase them for use during sexual intercourse; the item would likely be purchased due to the political message.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An information charging defendant with selling condoms bearing political messages on their packaging without a vendor's license in violation of Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 20-453 was facially insufficient since the condoms fell within the written matter exception contained in the statute, which specifically exempts vendors of newspapers, periodicals, pamphlets &quot;or other similar written matter&quot; from the attendant licensing requirements. The construction of the written matter exception by the Department of Consumer Affairs, the agency in charge of administering the ordinance, as applicable to &quot;items bearing political messages&quot; such as t-shirts, buttons and flags was entitled to be upheld as it was not irrational or unreasonable, and the condoms were not so dissimilar as to fall outside the same category of items bearing political messages. Additionally, the reasonable consumer of the condoms was unlikely to purchase them for their usual purpose, as a barrier device during sexual intercourse, but rather because of the political message contained on the wrapper. Moreover, the applicability of the exception does not rest on the item's similarity to the items specifically referenced in the statute. To further the legislature's intent of promoting free speech and freedom of press and preventing the statute from unconstitutionally restricting expression protected by the First Amendment, the term &quot;other similar written matter&quot; means similar insofar as it is a vehicle for speech and expression akin to a newspaper, periodical, book or pamphlet. Since the political message on the condom packaging was inextricably intertwined, defendant was engaged in a form of protected expression, despite that the condoms themselves had some other purpose or intrinsic value. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him--fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon under Penal Law &sect; 261.01(5); defendant claimed that the law, which criminalized his conduct solely because of his status as a non-citizen, discriminated against him in violation of his right to equal protection under law under US Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">As a lawful permanent resident, defendant properly completed and submitted all the requisite application documents to purchase a shotgun in accordance with Penal Law &sect; 400.00. Three days later, defendant rode home from his grocery store on his bicycle while carrying his new loaded shotgun that was covered by a blanket. As he arrived home and was riding up his driveway, the police stopped and arrested him for violating &sect; 261.01(5). Specifically, he was charged under a provision that criminalized only a non-United States citizen's possession of a dangerous instrument or weapon. The court found, inter alia, that &sect; 265.01(5) was plainly an alienage-based classification. Despite their burden to do so, however, the People did not proffer any state interest, let alone a compelling state interest, to justify the law. Regardless of the rationale for its enactment in 1905, there was no compelling state interest for its existence today. Since there was no conceivable reason that aliens should be distinguished from citizens to achieve the law's otherwise legitimate public safety objectives, the charges had to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penal Law &sect;265.01 (5), which prohibits a person who is not a citizen of the United States from possessing a dangerous or deadly weapon, is unconstitutional. The statute is an alienage-based classification and must be evaluated under a strict scrutiny analysis for purposes of determining whether it violates the Equal Protection Clause. The People did not proffer any state interest, let alone a compelling state interest, to justify the discriminatory law. There is no conceivable reason that aliens should be distinguished from citizens to achieve the law's otherwise legitimate public safety objectives. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with, inter alia, criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree, in violation of Penal Law &sect; 265.01(1), and unlawful possession of an air pistol, in violation of Administrative Code of the City of NY &sect; 10-131(b).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant said Penal Law &sect; 265.01(1)&nbsp;unconstitutionally barred his right to have a gun in his home for self-defense. Section 265.01(1) and Penal Law &sect; 400.00, on gun licenses, were not facially unconstitutional because a licensee could lawfully have a gun in his or her home. His claims contesting licensing rules failed because he could not show they kept him from getting a license since he never applied for one or showed it was futile to do so, as he had no criminal record. He did not show the police commissioner had unreviewable discretion to deny a license because an unsuccessful applicant had an appeal process subject to judicial review. The licensing law was constitutional under the intermediate scrutiny test because it was substantially related to an important governmental interest. The ban on possessing air pistols in Administrative Code of the City of NY &sect; 10-131(b) did not violate the Second Amendment because (1) air pistols were not &quot;arms,&quot; and (2) nothing showed they were chosen for the core lawful purpose of self-defense. The contested statutes were constitutional as applied because they gave clear notice of what was prohibited and explicit application standards.</SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 265.01 (1), which proscribes possession of a firearm, and &sect; 400.00, which authorizes the issuance of licenses to possess firearms in certain circumstances, are facially constitutional and do not run afoul of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">District of Columbia v Heller</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (554 US 570, 128 S Ct 2783, 171 L Ed 2d 637 [2008]).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 10-131 (b), which bans the possession of air pistols, is facially constitutional. The statute does not implicate the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and is, therefore, presumptively valid. Air pistols are not &quot;arms,&quot; given their operation and design for small game hunting, pest control and outdoor enthusiasts, as opposed to self-defense. In stark contrast, firearms manufacturers make clear that their products are intended to be effective in self-defense scenarios. Further, it was not established that American citizens overwhelmingly chose air guns, as they have chosen handguns, for the core lawful purpose of self-defense. The air pistol ban is rationally related to legitimate state interests and thus passes the rational basis test.</SPAN></P>

New York City had a rational statutory licensing scheme with meaningful and adequate court oversight. In any event, defendant apparently had not even attempted to obtain a license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant pled guilty to driving while intoxicated pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192(3). The matter was before the court for sentencing under Leandra's Law. L 2009, ch. 496.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court noted that the costs of interlock devises was indeterminate. The Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) approved seven qualified manufacturers and published of list of each provider's prices. The listed prices constituted the maximum fees permitted by 9 NYCRR 358.5(c)(3), but those costs were not final, as &sect; 358.5 permitted DCJS unilateral discretion to raise the rates. The court concluded that the legislature's failure statutorily to fix the ignition interlock costs presented a significant due process problem, because potential offenders and the general public could not determine the punishment for violating the law, given that the ultimate costs were subject to administrative fiat. Because defendant was not afforded notice of the interlock fine amounts, the rule of lenity forbid the court from ordering him to finance interlock installation and maintenance. The court further concluded that the State's failure to provide adequate legal guidance to judges making indigency determinations threatened defendant's right to equal protection of the law, as similarly situated defendants statewide had no assurance their financial circumstances would receive similar treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was to pay a $ 500 fine and a $ 395 surcharge-victim fee. His driver's license was revoked for six months. He was given a conditional discharge to successfully complete a Drinking Driver Program authorized by New York State within one year. For a six month period, he was prohibited from operating a vehicle without an ignition interlock. He had 10 business days to have an ignition interlock installed in any auto he chose to drive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Leandra's Law -- Cost of Installation and Maintenance of Ignition Interlock Devices -- Due Process</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. For purposes of sentencing under Leandra's Law (L 2009, ch 496), defendant could not be compelled to pay for the installation and maintenance of any ignition interlock device that he was required to have installed on any of his vehicles because the State has failed to provide adequate notice of the installation and maintenance costs to satisfy due process (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;US Const Amend XIV; NY Const, art I, &sect; 6), given that the costs are statutorily classified as criminal fines (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1198 [5] [a]). Since interlock costs are not statutorily fixed but subject to a regulatory scheme which permits the Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) unilateral discretion to raise rates at any time upon a request by a qualified manufacturer for a rate adjustment (9 NYCRR 358.5 [b] [2]), potential offenders and the general public cannot determine the punishment for violating the law. This ambiguity required invocation of the rule of lenity, a statutory construction doctrine rooted in due process that protects defendants against ambiguities informing the scope of and punishments required by criminal statutes and requires that defendants receive the lesser of the sanctions constructively afforded by the statute. Further, DCJS's failure to submit a final, determinate price list for interlock services for publication by the Secretary of State, in violation of the requirement under the New York Constitution that newly-enacted rules be filed with the Secretary of State (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art IV, &sect; 8) compounds the notice problem. That the State has designed the system such that no final cost can be ascertained does not suspend its obligation to publish a statement of those costs, given that it elected to classify them as criminal fines.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Leandra's Law -- Indigency Determinations -- Equal Protection</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The State's failure to provide adequate legal guidance to judges making indigency determinations under Leandra's Law (L 2009, ch 496), which requires that all first-time, misdemeanor driving while intoxicated offenders install ignition interlock devices in every automobile they own or operate for at least six months, and, barring indigency, that offenders pay for installation and maintenance of the interlock devices, violates equal protection because it may lead to arbitrary enforcement (US Const Amend XIV; NY Const, art I, &sect; 11). Under rational basis scrutiny, since Leandra's Law provides every court with essentially standardless discretion in determining ability to pay, similarly situated defendants statewide have no assurance that their financial circumstances will receive similar treatment. The lack of guidance could be used to pressure courts to help maintain the indigency-waiver system the Division of Criminal Justice Services has devised by suggesting that issues of systemic integrity should inform indigency determinations. That is, judges might fear that granting too many indigency waivers could undermine the ignition interlock program by making it unprofitable for qualified manufacturers who have contracted with the State to provide and maintain interlock services. Accordingly, Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1198 (4) and 9 NYCRR 358.8 are unconstitutional to the extent that they require the court to make indigency determinations without a statutory metric for ascertaining indigency. Therefore, the court was barred from granting any indigency waivers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Leandra's Law -- Requirement That Ignition Interlock Device be Installed in Every Automobile Defendant Owns is Overbroad</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The requirement under Leandra's Law (L 2009, ch 496) that a defendant convicted of driving while intoxicated install an ignition interlock device in every automobile he or she owns or operates (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 [1] [b] [ii]) is unconstitutionally overbroad, under a rational basis equal protection analysis. Therefore, the installation requirement is limited to any car a defendant chooses to operate. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner applicant sued respondents, the Banking Department of the State of New York and the Deputy Superintendent of Banks, seeking an order annulling their denial of his application for a mortgage loan originator (MLO) license and a writ of mandamus compelling them to review his application for an MLO license under the criteria set forth in Correction Law &sect; 753(1) and (2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">While working in the mortgage banking field, petitioner was convicted of making a false statement in a mortgage loan application. He later received a certificate of relief under Correction Law &sect; 701 removing all legal bars to employment and licensure except those pertaining to firearms and eligibility for public office. He satisfied all of the educational requirements for an MLO license and passed the written test, but respondents denied his application for an MLO license under Banking Law &sect; 599-e due to his prior conviction. The court held that applicants with an unpardoned felony conviction involving fraud, dishonesty, or a breach of trust, as of &sect; 599-e's effective date, could not be licensed as MLOs. Even if &sect; 753 applied, the Department had discretion under &sect; 701(2)(d) to deny him a license based on his conviction. Respondents' five to six month delay in processing his application was not grounds for relief. As the ability of felons to obtain employment and licensing was not eradicated by &sect; 599-e, there was no violation of the Contract Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Having no property right in an MLO license, the applicant was not deprived of property without due process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licenses -- Mortgage Loan Originator -- Prior Felony Conviction </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, who was convicted 17 years previously of the felony of making a false statement in a mortgage loan application but possessed a certificate of relief from disabilities, was not entitled to an order compelling the Banking Department to review his application for a mortgage loan originator license under the criteria set forth in Correction Law &sect; 753. The Banking Department based its decision on recently enacted Banking Law article 12-E, specifically section 599-e thereof, which provided that no license shall issue to a person convicted of a felony involving fraud or dishonesty. As neither Correction Law &sect; 753 nor certificates of relief were referenced in the new statute and absent any indication that the Legislature was unaware of section 753 and its prior integration with the Banking Law, an irrefutable inference must be drawn that what is omitted or not included was intended to be omitted or excluded. That both Correction Law &sect; 701, providing for the issuance of certificates of relief from disabilities, and Banking Law &sect; 599-e apply &quot;[n]otwithstanding any other law&quot; was immaterial, as the latter was enacted after the former, and thus, the Legislature could not have intended that the Correction Law apply notwithstanding any subsequently enacted legislation. Rather, the Legislature signaled its intentional omission from article 12-E of any requirement that an applicant's certificate of relief be considered.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licenses -- Mortgage Loan Originator -- Delay in Processing Application </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner, who was convicted 17 years previously of the felony of making a false statement in a mortgage loan application but possessed a certificate of relief from disabilities, did not establish that the delay by the Banking Department in processing his application for a license to be a mortgage loan originator constituted a basis for ordering the Department to review his application pursuant to the criteria set forth in Correction Law &sect; 753. Petitioner's interest in being licensed as a mortgage loan originator did not rise to the level of a property right; rather, it was an interest contingent on the meeting of certain legal requirements. Moreover, the delay in reviewing petitioner's application, resulting in the application of stricter new rules concerning applicants with felony convictions, was no more than five to six months, and there was no evidence that respondents awaited the passage of the new rules in order to deprive petitioner of a license.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licenses -- Mortgage Loan Originator -- Impairment of Contract </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner, who was convicted 17 years previously of the felony of making a false statement in a mortgage loan application but had a certificate of relief from disabilities, did not establish that the Banking Department's denial of his application for a license to be a mortgage loan originator pursuant to stricter new rules codified in article 12-E of the Banking Law constituted an unconstitutional impairment of contracts. While the Banking Department relied on the conviction to deny petitioner the license, which was not a matter of contract, article 12-E did not preclude him from pursuing other employment and did not preclude all ex-offenders from becoming mortgage loan originators, just those with a specified criminal history directly related to the mortgage loan industry. Thus, as the ability of felons to obtain employment and licensing had not been completely eradicated by the recent enactments, there was no basis for finding any potential violations of the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licenses -- Mortgage Loan Originator -- Due Process </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioner, who was convicted 17 years previously of the felony of making a false statement in a mortgage loan application but had a certificate of relief from disabilities, was not deprived of due process by the Banking Department's refusal to issue him a license to be a mortgage loan originator pursuant to new, stricter rules codified in article 12-E of the Banking Law. The issuance of a certificate of relief never guaranteed success in obtaining a license. Consequently, absent automatic entitlement to be licensed as an mortgage loan originator, even upon application of Correction Law &sect; 753 which sets forth factors to be considered concerning a previous conviction where a certificate of relief has been granted, petitioner had not established a legitimate claim of entitlement to the license, and thus had not shown that he had a property interest in being licensed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licenses -- Mortgage Loan Originator -- Damage to Reputation Following Denial of Application </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a proceeding arising out of the denial by respondents Banking Department and Deputy Superintendent of Banks of petitioner's application for a mortgage loan originator's license based on his prior felony conviction, petitioner failed to establish that his reputation had been damaged as a result of respondents' determination. Although respondents alerted petitioner's employer that he had been denied the license, there was no public dissemination of it, and as his employer was previously aware that petitioner possessed a certificate of relief from disabilities, it was already aware of his conviction. Also, information regarding petitioner's prior conviction was a matter of public record, which did not constitute dissemination of the underlying information.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Police seized defendant's car after arresting and charging him with traffic violations and other crimes.

The court agreed. The 25-day limitations period set forth &sect; 12-36(a) was a statute of limitations. As the limitations period was less than four months, under CPLR &sect; 306-b, plaintiff was required to serve the process with 15 days after the last day of the 25 day limitations period.

Plaintiff was required, under 38 RCNY 12-36 (a), to commence the action within 25 days of receiving defendant's demand for the return of his vehicle and the District Attorney's release. The 25-day period set forth in the governing regulations for the Property Clerk to commence a forfeiture proceeding (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">38 RCNY 12-36 [a]) is a judicially inspired, albeit untraditional statute of limitations, and where, as here, the applicable statute of limitations is four months or less, CPLR 306-b requires that service of process be made not later than 15 days &quot;after the date on which the applicable statute of limitations expires.&quot; As plaintiff failed to complete service of process no later than 15 days after the last day of the 25-day limitations period it otherwise had to commence the forfeiture action, dismissal of the action was warranted. </SPAN></P>

As the standard $500,000 monetary threshold amount applicable in 54 New York State counties applied to plaintiffs, they were subject to a widely applicable rule and not singled out for special treatment triggering application of the home rule provision; thus, they lacked standing. Moreover, the amendments were enacted in furtherance of and bore a reasonable relationship to a substantial statewide concern within the Legislature's purview and it was clearly within the Legislature's discretion to set higher thresholds for Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties and the five counties of New York City, as the Legislature reasonably, and in a way related to the State's purpose, took into account that large construction projects are significantly more common and labor costs for contractors are significantly higher in those counties than elsewhere in New York State. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondent, a prisoner who was designated as a sex-offender, was the subject of a petition for sex offender civil management pursuant to Sex Offender Management and Treatment Act (SOMTA), Mental Hygiene Law, art. 10, ch. 7, (2007). He moved to dismiss the petition on the basis that certain provisions of the statute as applied to him were violative of the United States and New York State constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The prisoner was convicted of kidnapping, promoting prostitution and bail jumping. He received concurrent indeterminate sentences of 9-18 years incarceration on the kidnapping charge, 4-8 years on the promoting prostitution charge and 3-6 years on the bail jumping charge. According to the State, he restrained the victim, repeatedly raped her, forced her to engage in prostitution, beat her and forced her to ingest narcotics. The prisoner also had prior convictions for unlawful imprisonment, attempted assault and forcing a person to engage in prostitution. The court found that there  was probable cause to believe the prisoner was a detained sex offender who suffered from a mental abnormality. The court held it was clear that the Legislature intended the challenged provision under Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.03 to be civil rather than punitive. The court determined that four of the Mendoza-Martinez factors weighed towards finding that the statute was not punitive and three towards the opposite conclusion. A consideration of the factors as a whole, however, supported the view that the retroactive sexually motivated felony designation was not punitive. There was no due process violation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent was not entitled to the dismissal of a petition seeking sex offender civil management on the basis that the designation of a nonsexual offense committed prior to the effective date of the Sex Offender Management and Treatment Act (SOMTA) (Mental Hygiene Law art 10) as a sexually motivated felony imposes retroactive punishment in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 9 [3]). The retroactive designation of previous criminal conduct as sexually motivated was intended to define which nonsexual felony offenders could be subject to SOMTA, not to impose a criminal sanction. Moreover, the Legislature denominated a SOMTA jury's determination of whether an offender's previous conviction was sexually motivated as part of the civil management process, and the classification is contained in a civil statute, the Mental Hygiene Law, as part of a civil proceeding with a potential consequence of civil management. Furthermore, the retroactive sexually motivated felony classification serves a purpose other than punishment--determining an offender's civil management eligibility--and it is not constitutionally excessive in relation to such purpose as it is a rational method to capture offenders who have committed sexually motivated crimes and may suffer from a mental abnormality. Rather, the retroactive sexually motivated felony designation provides for the treatment and management of sexual offenders suffering from a mental abnormality for the purpose of protecting public safety. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Civil Commitment or Supervision -- Applicability of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> of Limitations to Retroactive Designation of Prior Felony as Sexually Motivated</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding seeking sex offender civil management based on a sexual motivation determination for a designated felony committed prior to the effective date of the Sex Offender Management and Treatment Act (SOMTA) (Mental Hygiene Law art 10), the failure of SOMTA to impose a five-year limitations period in connection with the determination that an offender's previous felony conviction was &quot;sexually motivated&quot; does not violate due process and equal protection. While there is a risk of an erroneous deprivation of a person's liberty interest inherent in the absence of a statute of limitations, there is no procedural due process violation. The procedures of SOMTA which would be used to subject respondent to civil management based upon his 1992 felonies militate against such risk. The burden of proving sexual motivation is on the State and a sexual motivation finding is usually made with the benefit of extensive information about an offender's behaviors and motivations over the course of his or her lifetime. Moreover, the ultimate deprivation of liberty under the statute can only occur upon a finding that respondent currently suffers from a mental abnormality, and while the retrospective designation of a prior felony as sexually motivated is a necessary prerequisite to such a finding, it cannot alone establish it. Nor is there an equal protection violation. SOMTA is narrowly tailored to meet a compelling state objective--the protection of the public from dangerous sex offenders--because, without the challenged provision, offenders like respondent would not be covered by SOMTA at all. Furthermore, a statute of limitations is not required for a retroactive sexual motivation designation because the determination has no effect on a respondent's criminal conviction, but is only a screening device to determining civil management eligibility. Further, the requirement that an offender be a detained sex offender under SOMTA imposes an effective temporal limitation in a wide range of cases on the ability of the State to allege that a prior designated felony was sexually motivated. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Village complained that the Town Board improperly amended the Comprehensive Plan by enacting the zoning change and amending the zoning map. The Village claimed that the granting of the petition by the company was an act of spot zoning and unconstitutional and was for the benefit of the property owner, not the community at large. The court held that none of those causes of action were appropriately raised by the Village. Because the interests of the Villages were thus related marginally, if at all, to the purposes intended to be promoted by the procedural requirements of Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 20, they did not have standing to prosecute the claims. The Village could not allege that the Town Board did not comply with General Municipal Law &sect; 239-m since the Town Board did follow each required step. Thus, the court found that the Village did not have standing to criticize the reasoning set forth in the resolutions.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In an action by a village challenging a town's zoning decision, causes of action alleging that the town improperly amended a comprehensive plan by enacting the zoning change and amending the zoning map were dismissed for lack of standing. The allegation that the granting of a developer's petition &quot;was an act of spot zoning and unconstitutional and was for the benefit of the property owner, not the community at large,&quot; was not appropriately raised by the village, which had no interest in the town's compliance with either its comprehensive plan or the procedural requirements. Since the village exercised its own zoning authority with respect to property located within its geographical jurisdiction, it was beyond the bounds of the mutuality of restriction and benefit that underlay the comprehensive plan requirement. It also had, at most, a limited stake in the integrity of the governmental decision-making process in the town.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In an action by a village challenging a town's zoning decision, the village lacked standing to assert a cause of action criticizing the reasoning set forth in the resolutions of the town board which adopted the zoning resolutions and which were contrary to certain recommendations of the county planning board, where the board otherwise complied with the procedural requirements of General Municipal Law &sect; 239-m.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In an action by a village challenging a town's zoning decision, a cause of action alleging that the town ignored the public policy spirit of cooperation set forth in General Municipal Law &sect; 239-nn &quot;by completely ignoring the surrounding community and failing to coordinate or even take into consideration [the village's] land-use patterns&quot; was dismissed. Section 239-nn does not create a right of action. Moreover, the village admitted that it did receive the notice required by the statute.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In an action by a village challenging a town's zoning decision, a cause of action alleging that the town violated the State Environmental Quality Review Act by failing to take a &quot;hard look&quot; at the development that prompted the zoning change was dismissed for lack of standing. Zoning challenges may only be made by &quot;aggrieved&quot; persons. A municipality is limited to asserting rights that are its own, and is not permitted to assert the collective individual rights of its residents. Although the village set forth certain substantive criticisms of the final and draft environmental impact statements, it failed to assert with any specificity or detail that any of those problems had or would have a direct impact on it. Although the village alleged that the proposed development would create traffic and water runoff problems, and that &quot;wall-to-wall&quot; development would alter the character of the surrounding neighborhood, it did not provide any support for those conclusory allegations. Accordingly, the village did not demonstrate that it had a real, concrete interest in the potential environmental impacts of the development. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondent, a juvenile, submitted that the two charges in the petition, Unlawful Assembly and Riot in the 2nd Degree, were facially insufficient and therefore, the petition against him should be dismissed. Petitioner Presentment Agency contended that the facts alleged in the petition were sufficient to establish each element of the crimes charged and respondent's commission thereof, and therefore, the petition should not be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The police observed two groups of young people facing each other near a school. The police affiant stated that two groups were &quot;threatening&quot; each other. The affidavit did not recount the words that the officer deemed &quot;threatening.&quot; Ten individuals comprised one group and 20 comprised the other. Respondent was seen in the group of 20 individuals. When the police attempted to disperse the groups, one of the members of respondent's group threw a glass bottle. The court held the petition failed to state any act of tumultuous and violent conduct engaged in by respondent. Nor were any facts alleged which would support an inference that respondent intentionally aided, solicited, importuned or commanded any other member of the group to engage in violent conduct. In regard to Penal Law &sect; 240.10, in order to be facially sufficient, the petition had to allege conduct, words or acts, specific to respondent which supported an inference that the respondent's purpose in being present with the group was to engage in imminent violent and tumultuous conduct. The allegation that members of the group were &quot;threatening&quot; was not specific to respondent and was otherwise conclusory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a juvenile delinquency proceeding brought against respondent, who was alleged to have been part of one of two groups of young people &quot;threatening&quot; each other, the count in the petition charging respondent with riot in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.05) based on allegations that some of the 20 members of respondent's group were &quot;reaching for their waistbands,&quot; that some members possessed a golf club, a broomstick and a belt, and that one member threw a glass bottle when the police attempted to disperse the groups was facially insufficient. An individual violates Penal Law &sect; 240.05 when he or she, simultaneously with four or more other persons, engages in tumultuous and violent conduct and thereby intentionally or recklessly causes or creates a grave risk of causing public alarm. Here, the petition failed to state any act of tumultuous and violent conduct engaged in by respondent. Nor did it allege facts specific to respondent from which it might be inferred that respondent shared a community of purpose with others engaged in violent and tumultuous conduct, which went beyond his mere presence at the scene.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a juvenile delinquency proceeding brought against respondent, who was alleged to have been part of one of two groups of young people &quot;threatening&quot; each other, the count in the petition charging respondent with unlawful assembly (Penal Law &sect; 240.10) based on allegations that some of the 20 members of respondent's group were &quot;reaching for their waistbands,&quot; that some members possessed a golf club, a broomstick and a belt, and that one member threw a glass bottle when the police attempted to disperse the groups was facially insufficient. An individual violates Penal Law &sect; 240.10 when he or she assembles with four or more other persons for the purpose of engaging or preparing to engage with them in tumultuous and violent conduct likely to cause public alarm, or when, being present at an assembly which either has or develops such purpose, he or she remains there with the intent to advance that purpose. Here, the petition did not allege conduct, words or acts specific to respondent which supported an inference that respondent's purpose in being present with the group was to engage in imminent violent and tumultuous conduct. The only allegation made that was specific to respondent was that he was observed to be part of the group. </SPAN></P>

Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 10-136 (b) (1), which provides that &quot;[n]o person shall solicit, ask or beg in an aggressive manner in any public place,&quot; is not unconstitutionally vague. &quot;Aggressive manner&quot; is defined, in part, as &quot;[i]ntentionally blocking or interfering with the safe or free passage of a pedestrian&quot; (Administrative Code &sect; 10-136 [a] [1] [c]), a definition that does not require the would-be solicitor to ponder whether his or her actions would somehow unreasonably inconvenience or annoy someone. Here, defendant and the five others arrested with him and charged with aggressive begging in a public place were observed to have formed a line across the sidewalk along a major thoroughfare and thrust their CDs into the faces of passersby. Positioning themselves in such a manner would have likely interfered with the free passage of pedestrians along that sidewalk, and a person of common intelligence would not have had to guess that such activity would be prohibited.  </SPAN></P>

Although begging or soliciting charitable donations in public is constitutionally protected speech and the city's sidewalks are a public forum, government may limit the time, place and manner of solicitation of contributions on those sidewalks under its so-called police power if the restriction is content-neutral and aimed at advancing the public interest. Administrative Code &sect; 10-136 (b) (1) does not ban the solicitation of contributions, just those solicitations that intimidate other persons or impede pedestrian or vehicular traffic. </SPAN></P>
