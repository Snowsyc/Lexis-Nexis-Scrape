</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While in the Navy, the decedent maintained equipment insulated with a manufacturer's asbestos products. The manufacturer was purchased by the corporation. While the widow's suit was pending, the Texas Legislature passed Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 149.001-149.006, which limited the liability of successor corporations for asbestos-related claims and was applicable retroactively. The trial court granted the corporation's motion for summary judgment because the damages it had already paid to other plaintiffs exceeded the monetary cap contained in the statute. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally retroactive under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 because it was a valid exercise of the Legislature's police power to safeguard the public safety and welfare. It was narrowly tailored to protect the most innocent corporations hard hit by asbestos litigation but leaving the potential pool of asbestos defendants as large as possible. The statute was not an unconstitutional special law under Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 56 because a reasonable basis existed for Texas's classification of innocent successor corporations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public officials sought review of a decision of the County Court at Law No. 3, El Paso County (Texas), entered in a quo warranto proceeding brought by appellee State of Texas declaring that a city was not lawfully incorporated and removing appellants from their positions as city officeholders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State of Texas obtained, in a quo warranto proceeding, a declaration that a city was not incorporated and a judgment that removed appellant public officials from office. Appellants argued that the enactment of 1891 Tex. Gen. Laws 24 (Act), which disincorporated the city of which they were elected public officials, was unconstitutional in that it was a prohibited local law which changed the charter of the city in contravention of Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 56. The court affirmed, upholding the constitutionality of the Act. A law was not a prohibited local law merely because it applied only in a limited geographic area where there was a reasonable basis for the classification and where no general law applied. While art. 3, &sect; 56 prevented the legislature from changing a charter by creative act it did not prohibit disincorporation. The stated public purpose of the Act was to disincorporate because certain provisions of the original charter were unjust to the city's residents. In light of that purpose, a geographic classification was the only practicable choice. A local law did not violate art. 3, &sect; 56 simply because it had a greater impact on some citizens than others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the lower court upholding the constitutionality of an Act disincorporating a city and the judgment removing appellant public officials from office was affirmed because the legislature was not constitutionally prohibited from repealing a charter and a local law was not prohibited because it applied only in a limited geographical area where a general law was not applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to the offense of rape of a child. When he was released from prison, defendant failed to register as a sex offender. The 399th Judicial District Court, Bexar County (Texas), denied defendant's motion to set aside and dismiss with prejudice the indictment. Defendant pled nolo contendere pursuant to a plea bargain and he was sentenced to two years confinement and a fine. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant signed a pre-release notification form stating that he had to register as a sex offender wherever he decided to reside. Defendant moved to Mexico and then moved back to San Antonio, Texas. Because defendant was residing in San Antonio and had failed to register as a sex offender with any law enforcement agency, officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety arrested defendant. The appellate court found that an offense defined in a predecessor statute of those offenses listed in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 62.01(5) (2003), including rape of a child, was a reportable conviction or adjudication for purposes of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 62.10 and 62.02(a) (2003). Thus, defendant's offense was reportable. Additionally, the fair notice requirement was satisfied because his pre-release notification stated that he had to register as a sex offender. Finally, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 62.10 did not permit arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement and sufficiently detailed the prohibited conduct. Therefore, art. 62.10 was not unconstitutionally vague, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to set aside the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city brought declaratory judgment action against appellant landowners who had designated zones in local extraterritorial jurisdiction. Both sides moved for summary judgment. Denying appellants' attorney fee claims, 345th District Court, Travis County (Texas), declared Tex. Water Code &sect; 26.179 (1995) unconstitutional and permanently enjoined appellants from designating new zones or adding land to existing zones. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Texas legislature enacted Tex. Water Code (Code) &sect; 26.179 (1995), which allowed landowners of contiguous tracts of at least 500 acres within certain municipalities' extraterritorial jurisdictions (ETJs) to designate their property as &quot;water quality protection zones.&quot; Seeking declaration that &sect; 26.179 was unconstitutional, appellee city sued appellant landowners who had designated zones in the local ETJ. Parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Without specifying any grounds, trial court rendered final judgment declaring &sect; 26.179&nbsp;unconstitutional and issued permanent injunction enjoining appellants from designating new zones or adding land to existing zones. Trial court also denied appellant's attorney fee claims. Appellants sought review. Court affirmed, holding that &sect; 26.179 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to private landowners. As a whole, eight relevant judicial factors weighed against the constitutionality of the private delegation. Under the Texas Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code &sect; 37.009, trial court did not abuse its discretion to award attorney fees as were equitable and just.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because delegation of legislative power was unconstitutional in statute that allowed appellant private landowners to designate property as &quot;water quality protection zones&quot; within appellee city's extraterritorial jurisdictions, court affirmed trial court's final judgment that declared statute unconstitutional and permanently enjoined appellants from designating new zones. Trial court did not abuse discretion by denying appellants' attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellee university employee's employment was terminated, he brought an employment discrimination suit against appellant university complaining he was terminated in retaliation for taking leave under the self-care leave provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act. The County Court at Law No. 3 of El Paso County, Texas, denied the university's plea to the jurisdiction. The university appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the university raised several issues challenging the trial court's denial of its plea to the jurisdiction, arguing that Congress did not validly abrogate state sovereign immunity from suit under the self-care provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2601 et seq., and, therefore, the trial court erred by denying the plea to the jurisdiction. The appellate court disagreed and held that 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2612(a)(1)(D) was congruent and proportional to its remedial object, and could be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior. The FMLA defined public agency to include both the government of a state or political subdivision and any agency of a state or a political subdivision of a state. 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 203(x) (Supp. 2008); 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2611(4)(A)(iii). The U.S. Congress made unmistakably clear its intention to abrogate the States' sovereign immunity. Thus, the university's sovereign immunity was validly abrogated by the enactment of the FMLA, and the trial court properly denied the university's plea to the jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the 8th Judicial District Court, Hopkins County (Texas), which denied defendant's pretrial motion for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the constitutionality of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.12, under which defendant was charged with improper relationship between educator and student.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly engaged in prohibited sexual contact with a student of the secondary school where defendant was employed. The court held that &sect; 21.12 was not overbroad, noting that the record contained no data about what percentage of secondary school students affected by &sect; 21.12 were adults. Thus, even if the statute could be said to infringe on fundamental First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, rights of consenting adults, it was not shown to reach a substantial amount of protected conduct. A due process claim was not cognizable on a pretrial application for habeas relief. There was no violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because the state had a legitimate interest in protecting secondary school students of any age from the pressures, emotional strain, conflicts, distractions, and other difficulties brought on by sexual conduct with their teachers. Language in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.12(c) authorizing prosecutions under more than one section for the same conduct was not a double jeopardy violation under the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, because the applicable test compared elements of offenses, not conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child in two cases before the 265th Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas). The trial court deferred adjudication of guilt and placed defendant on community supervision. Subsequently, the State moved to proceed with adjudication of guilt in both cases, alleging he violated the terms of his community supervision. The trial court adjudicated his guilt. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended no legally or constitutionally valid hearing was held in the proceeding to adjudicate his guilt, and the statute preventing him from appealing without the trial judge's express permission was unconstitutional. He complained his plea of true did not track the allegations in the State's original motion to proceed and an amended motion to proceed was not filed. No appeal could be taken from the trial court's determination to proceed with adjudication of guilt on the original charge under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b) (Vernon Supp. 2002). Thus, the appellate court did not have jurisdiction to address his complaint. The appellate court concluded the statute was not unconstitutional under either the federal or state constitution, as there was a rational and legitimate State interest in curtailing appeals from hearings, where guilt was adjudicated under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b). The appellate court found that the Texas legislature rationally chose to condition the award of the benefit of having no record of conviction for a defendant who completed the term of community supervision on the relinquishment of a right to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment in each case.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court that even though appellant met the requirements of adequate remedy at law by defense of a criminal prosecution and irreparable injury to a vested property interest, appellant's failure to join as a party defendant the criminal district attorney for appellee, the official authorized by law to enforce the sexually-oriented business regulations, deprived the trial court of jurisdiction over the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the gang injunction statute,&nbsp;Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 125.065 (2005), the 89th District Court of Wichita County, Texas, enjoined 17 members of a street gang who had allegedly engaged in criminal activity, including defendant, from engaging in certain activities. Defendant subsequently pled guilty under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.021 (2003) to violating the court's order. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on prior case law, the court found that &sect; 71.021, which made it an offense to violate a gang injunction under &sect; 125.065, was not vague and overbroad. The statute also did not violate the Nondelegation Doctrine enunciated in Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. It would have been neither practical nor efficient for the Texas legislature, which met every other year for a few months, to determine the exact requirements necessary in order to prevent gang members from engaging in future gang activities. Further, the legislature merely asked the trial courts to impose reasonable requirements, while retaining the power to make the law by determining that a violation of the requirements, even those judicially imposed, was an offense. Although defendant failed to preserve his as-applied challenge base on service of process, the court noted that any failure to serve process on defendant's biological mother did not adversely affect defendant's interests because defendant's guardian or custodian received notice of the injunction hearing and appeared.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.31(a) (2003). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised various issues, but the court affirmed. Given that the legislature chose not to apply the parole eligibility amendment retroactively to juveniles who have already been sentenced for a capital murder, the court found it inappropriate to judicially amend Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.31(a)(1). Until the United States Supreme Court or the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals determined otherwise, the Texas sentencing scheme mandating life without parole for a juvenile convicted of capital murder did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Defendant sentence was not grossly disproportionate. He was convicted of shooting a store clerk in the head multiple times during a robbery. Even if the sentence was sufficient to create an inference of gross disproportionality, there was no evidence allowed the court to compare defendant's sentence to other sentences. The summons expressly referred to the attached petition and the petition contained references to criminal proceedings in criminal court. Thus, the court overruled defendant's claim that the summons was invalid under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 54.02(b) (2009).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowner challenged a decision of the County Court at Law Number Three of Bexar County (Texas), which (1) prohibited him from (a) filing any motions or litigation unless granted permission, and (b) appearing or contacting certain persons, and later (2) dismissed with prejudice his suit against appellees, a company, its founder, and employees, for emotional distress and negligence, and (3) declared the homeowner a vexatious litigant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner alleged that the company relayed a profane phone call to him. He sued, but the trial court dismissed the suit, declared him to be a vexatious litigant, and entered injunctive provisions and prohibitions. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The homeowner's threat of additional litigation did not justify a summary determination that he was vexatious. However, it did justify an expedited hearing, for purposes of Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 11.053(a). Because he failed to attack all of the independent grounds supporting the finding that he did not have a reasonable probability of prevailing on his claims, the court had to uphold the trial court's ruling on this issue. The company was the only defendant that entered a general appearance and made a motion under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 11.051, and when the homeowner failed to post security, the company filed a motion to dismiss the case with prejudice. The statutes were very clear. Because the founder and employees did not make a motion under &sect; 11.051, they were not entitled to a dismissal with prejudice under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 11.056.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order containing various injunctive provisions was vacated in toto. The judgment dismissing the case with prejudice was reversed in part as it pertained to anyone other than the company. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed, and the matter was remanded for disposing of the remaining defendants. Nothing cast doubt on the finding that the homeowner was a vexatious litigant or the prohibition against his filing any new litigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband sued appellees, wife and sheriff, in the 148th District Court of Nueces County, Texas, seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment barring seizure and sale of the husband's personal property to satisfy a child support judgment in favor of the wife. The trial court entered a take nothing judgment against the husband. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife obtained a money judgment against the husband for past-due child support. Personal property belonging to the husband was then seized by the sheriff pursuant to writs of garnishment and execution obtained by the wife. The husband sued, alleging that Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 42.005 violated Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 49 because it allowed seizure of personal property to satisfy a judgment for past-due child support, while other sections of the property code exempted seizure of such property for satisfaction a debt. The appellate court held that the statute was not unconstitutional.  Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 42.001 and 42.002 (Vernon 2000) were enacted to protect debtors from unsecured creditors. A child support obligation was not, however, a debt, but was, rather, a natural and legal duty. The legislature was, therefore, within its authority to exclude child support judgments from the categories of personal property exempt from seizure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer challenged a judgment entered by the County Court at Law of Nacogdoches County, Texas, against it in appellee wrecker service's lawsuit under Tex. Occ. Code Ann. &sect; 2303.156(b) (2004) to recover towing charges incurred by the insurer's insured following an accident involving a tractor-trailer owned by the insured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state trooper who responded to the accident ordered that the tractor and trailer be towed from the scene. They were towed to the wrecker service's vehicle storage facility. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to find that the tow was consensual. The evidence of fair market values and costs to repair was sufficient evidence to enable a reasonable and fair minded finder of fact to find that the tractor and trailer were a total loss. The trial court did not err by concluding that &sect; 2303.156(b) was not limited to instances where title had been transferred to the insurance company. Further, the result of the trial court's interpretation of the statute, which followed the statute's plain text, was not absurd. Under &sect; 2303.156(b), a &quot;total loss&quot; occurred whenever the repair costs of a vehicle exceeded the vehicle's preincident fair market value. Section 2303.156(b) contained no language requiring that an insurance company actually abandon a vehicle. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The application of &sect; 2303.156(b) to the insurer was not a taking within the meaning of the Takings Clause. Finally, the insurer was not denied procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an undercover investigation, an officer observed numerous video lottery machines in appellant's possession. Appellant was charged with possession of a gambling device in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 47.06. Appellant asserted that Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 47.01(4)(B) (the statute) provided a defense for appellant, arguing that the statute permitted the machines. Appellee contended the statute was unconstitutional because it allegedly conflicted with Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 47. The trial court agreed and overruled appellant's motion to dismiss. Subsequently, the parties announced a plea agreement and appellant pled nolo contendere. On appeal, appellant argued the trial court erred in declaring the statute unconstitutional. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause. Applying the presumption of validity to the legislature's statutory definition of &quot;gambling device&quot; and considering that the constitution did not criminalize possession of gambling devices, the court concluded the trial court erred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 186th Judicial District Court, Bexar County, Texas, entered a pre-trial written order granting defendant's motion to quash the portion of the indictment used to elevate each count of sexual assault from a second degree felony to a first degree felony under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.011(f) (2011). The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.011(f) (2011) did not merely prescribe an increased punishment range when the additional fact of bigamous conduct was proven, but required proof of the additional fact as an element in order for the first-degree felony conviction to occur. Thus, under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.01(a)(1) (Supp. 2010), the State had the right to appeal the trial court's order quashing the &sect; 22.011(f) portions of the indictment as the order altered the face of the indictment, changed the nature of the offense on which the State's prosecution could proceed, and effectively terminated the State's prosecution of defendant for commission of first degree felony sexual assault. In addition, defendant's motion to quash challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 22.011(f) only as it applied to him. But, an as-applied constitutional challenge could not be resolved through a pre-trial motion to quash prior to presentment of the evidence. Finally, even if an appellate court could discern a facial challenge within defendant's motion, he had failed to rebut the presumption of constitutionality by proving Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.011 operated unconstitutionally in all its applications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The property was purchased during foreclosure for more than the amount owed, and the excess proceeds were awarded to the taxing units to satisfy post-judgment taxes, penalties, and interest due on the property, with the balance of the excess proceeds to be disbursed to the owner. The owner argued that the 1999 amendments to Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 34.02(c) of the Property Tax Code were unconstitutional, as they allowed the trial court to reopen her tax judgment and award additional moneys to the taxing units. The appellate court ruled that the owner failed to rebut the presumption that the statute was valid and failed to establish that the 1999 amendments to the Property Tax Code were unconstitutional. Also, the tax judgment provided that the owner was required to pay any additional taxes that accrued on the property until it was sold, the property was not sold for three years, and the owner was responsible for the property taxes from 1997 through 2000, when the property was sold.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two issues, defendant argued that the continuous sexual abuse statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.02 (Supp. 2010), was unconstitutional. The court overruled both issues. The statute had the effect of rearranging and extending the statute of limitations for some of the component offenses. Although defendant identified a hypothetical circumstance whereby the State might delay a prosecution to disadvantage a defendant, that scenario was not present in this case, and defendant otherwise failed to show that the statute was unconstitutional because it did not have a statute of limitations. Defendant also failed to show that the statute was vague or that it was vague in all applications or as applied to him. The statute was not void for vagueness because it allowed for prosecution of events that might occur over the spread of several years. Defendant also failed to show that the statute was unconstitutional because it did not require the jury to unanimously agree on which specific acts of sexual abuse he committed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied all injunctive and declaratory relief. The businesses appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The businesses sold accident reports for purposes of solicitation or relied on such reports to solicit clients following an accident. The legislature passed Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.18 (Supp. 2003), which made it a misdemeanor for a person to obtain information from the Department of Public Safety of the State of Texas or any other governmental entity and to use the information for the direct solicitation of business or employment for pecuniary gain. The businesses unsuccessfully challenged the statute as violating their commercial speech rights. The appellate court initially noted if the state desired to regulate truthful, non-deceptive speech relating to a commercial transaction, it bore the burden of showing it had a substantial interest in supporting the regulation, the regulation directly and materially advanced that interest, and that the legislation was narrowly tailored to advance that interest. The appellate court held the statute was neither reasonably tailored nor proportional to the harm the state sought to prevent and imposed an unconstitutional permanent ban on individuals who sought to conduct their business by using legally obtained information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for speeding, arguing multifarious constitutional issues. Appellant asserted the trial court was unconstitutionally created, the State was improperly represented by the city prosecutor, the charging instrument was void, the statute involved constituted an unlawful use of police power, there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, and the trial court lacked jurisdiction. The court summarily dealt with appellant's first, second, third, and fifth issues stating those issues had been previously decided counter to appellant's position. The court addressed his police power argument by noting driving an automobile on Texas streets was a privilege subject to reasonable regulation under the State's police power in the interest of the welfare and safety of the public and that municipalities had the authority to regulate the use of its streets. The court affirmed, holding the speeding statute was reasonable and the trial court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the case.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of Travis County, 98th Judicial District, Texas, granted the corporation's motion and ordered the comptroller to refund $ 480,383 in tax plus interest and statutory interest. The comptroller appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute arose out of the corporation's 1993 cessation of business in Texas for franchise-tax purposes due to its merger with another company. In 1991 the legislature amended the state's franchise-tax act to establish &quot;earned surplus&quot; as the tax base from which to calculate the major portion of a business's franchise tax. The amendments resulted in the corporation, a fiscal-year taxpayer, owing a franchise tax computed on income earned beginning in February 1990, in contrast to calendar-year taxpayers who owed the tax computed on income earned beginning in January 1991. The appeals court held the trial court erred in finding the earned-surplus amendments unconstitutional because they disproportionately impacted fiscal-year taxpayers. The appeals court found all taxpayers falling within the class were treated equally under the amendments and that the legislation was rationally related to a legitimate governmental goal. Because the corporation did not allege a net operating loss for report year 1992, the trial court erred in determining the corporation was entitled to a business-loss carryover for that year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and a judgment was rendered that the corporation take nothing by its suit for a tax refund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with 29 counts of sexual assault of a child and one count of indecency with a child. The Fourth Court of Appeals, Bexar County (Texas), reversed the decision of the trial court that granted defendant's motion to quash multiple portions of the indictment that were based on the bigamy provision of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.011(f). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the appellate court had jurisdiction to review the trial court's order granting the motion to quash because the quashed provisions were alleged in the indictment and were a portion of the indictment, and therefore Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 44.01(a)(1) could be invoked to permit the State's appeal. The appellate court erred by rejecting defendant's facial challenge to the constitutionality of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.011(f) because defendant's written motion, the parties arguments before the trial court, and the trial court's ruling each discussed the statutes treatment of married people as a class. However, the appellate court properly held that defendant failed to prove that &sect; 22.011(f) was facially unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because it had at least one valid application, namely the punishment of bigamists who sexually assaulted their purported spouses. Because defendant failed to show that it was unconstitutional in every respect, &sect; 22.011(f) was not facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that because the trial court failed to admonish him, his plea was rendered involuntary pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code Ann.  &sect; 54.03(b)(2) (Vernon 1996) and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.  art. 26.13(a)(5) (Vernon Supp. 2001). Registration was considered remedial rather than punitive; therefore the consequences of registration were collateral. The trial court did not have an affirmative duty to admonish a defendant prior to his plea that he had to register for sexual offender registration.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.  art. 62.12(b)(1) (Vernon Supp. 2001) clearly stated when the duty to register ended, it was not a matter of discretion by the trial court. Mere injury to an adult sex offender's reputation alone was insufficient to implicate a liberty interest. The registration and notification statutes had a special relationship to the state's interests that the legislation sought to protect and advance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged an order of the 131st Judicial District Court, Bexar County, Texas, which denied the city's plea to the jurisdiction and granted a temporary injunction against the city in an action by appellees, a homeowners' association and individual property owners (owners), challenging the city's proposed annexation of their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners alleged that annexation of their areas would be a direct violation of H.B. 585 (Tex. 2005). The city claimed that H.B. 585 was unconstitutional as a special law because it only applied to the northeast area of the city. The court held that the owners did not have standing to assert their claim of violations of the procedure set forth in Tex. Loc. Gov't Code ch. 43 because the claim must be brought by the State in a quo warranto proceeding. Nor did they have standing to assert the claim that the city refused to arbitrate because the arbitration request was premature in that it was made prior to commencement of negotiations. The court also held that it was necessary for the trial court to make a ruling on the constitutionality in order to conclude that the owners had standing. Based on the language, the statute was clearly a local law, and there was no evidence as to why it was reasonable to single out the areas in the statute for special treatment. Therefore, because H.B. 585 singled out a specific geographic area for special treatment, it was unconstitutional and the owners did not have standing to assert a claim under H.B. 585.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from one conviction for continuous sexual abuse, two convictions for aggravated sexual assault, and two convictions for indecency with a child. The appellate court affirmed the conviction for continuous sexual abuse but vacated his convictions on counts two through three for aggravated sexual assault and counts four through five for indecency with a child. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the entirety of the child's interview in response to questioning by the defense under Tex. R. Evid. 107 and 403. The State conceded that if it overruled defendant's first and third points so as to affirm his conviction on the continuous sexual abuse count, it was required to reverse the remainder of the convictions for aggravated sexual assault and indecency with a child under U.S. Const. amend. V; Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 14; Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.02(e) (Supp. 2011). Accordingly, the appellate court sustained defendant's second point and vacated those four convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, two accused persons, challenged a decision from the District Court of Travis County, 331st Judicial District, Texas, which denied their habeas corpus petitions. Specifically, the petitions sought the dismissal of indictments accusing them of accepting unlawful campaign contributions and money laundering.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictments alleged violations of Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 253.003, 253.094 (2003), as well as violations of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 34.02 (Supp. 2008). A petition of habeas corpus was filed seeking the dismissal of the indictments based on overbreadth and vagueness. After the petition was denied, this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the Texas Election Code's prohibitions on the making and accepting of corporate political contributions were not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The challenged statutes gave constitutionally adequate notice of the conduct prohibited and sufficiently determinate guidelines for law enforcement. Further, there was no basis in the current jurisprudence to apply an express advocacy limiting construction to the corporate contribution restrictions in the Texas Election Code. Moreover, the pre-2005 version of the money laundering statute was not unconstitutionally vague on its face because the term &quot;funds&quot; in this statute did not include checks or other negotiable instruments that were not the functional equivalent of cash.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Criminal District Court No. 3 of Tarrant County, Texas, convicting him of one count of continuous sexual abuse, two counts of aggravated sexual assault, and two counts of indecency with a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to a forensic interviewer who interviewed the child, the child identified defendant as the perpetrator and denied that anyone else had abused her. Defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion under Tex. R. Evid. 107 and 403 by admitting the entirety of the child's interview in response to questioning by the defense. The appellate court agreed with the State that the defense left the impression that the interviewer had possibly manipulated the interview by asking repetitive questions even though she was not supposed to and that she excessively repeated the child's answers. Although the defense argued that the State should just be allowed to ask follow-up questions, the jury would not have had any yardstick by which to measure the effect of the interviewer's questions and techniques on the child, which occurred before the child testified at trial, other than by seeing the actual interview. Also, defendant did not preserve his constitutionally challenges, both facially and as applied, to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.02 for appellate review. Defendant raised neither challenge in the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions for aggravated sexual assault and indecency with a child were reversed and a judgment of acquittal was rendered on those four counts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the 351st District Court, Harris County (Texas), which found him guilty of possessing body armor, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.041(b) (2003), and sentenced him to two years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a previously convicted felon, was charged with the felony offense of possessing body armor. He filed a motion to dismiss. The trial court denied the motion. He entered a plea of no contest to the offense and a plea of true to the allegations in the enhancement paragraph. The trial court sentenced him to two years in prison. On appeal, he claimed that &sect; 46.041 violated his right to equal protection of the law under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The court, applying the rational basis test, found that the statute was rationally related to a legitimate government interest of precluding felons from possessing body armor because of their greater potential to abuse the right to possess body armor. Under the rational basis review, the court respected the determinations of the Texas Legislature. The statute did not draw distinctions that made no sense. Defendant failed to demonstrate that there was no rational relationship between the prohibition for nonviolent felons and a legitimate government purpose. He only cited to general case law explaining the rational basis test. Therefore, he did not fulfill his burden to negate every conceivable basis that might support the classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Texas Board of Medical Examiners and its director, challenged a decision of the District Court of Travis County, 98th Judicial District (Texas), which reversed its decision denying a license to appellee foreign doctor on the basis that she did not pass the U.S. Medical Licensing Exam within the permissible number of attempts allowed under the Medical Practice Act, Tex. Occ. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 151.001-165.160 (2004 &amp; Supp. 2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board included an examination attempt by the doctor prior to the effective date of a September 1, 1993 amendment to the Act that limited the number of permissible attempts to three. The trial court reversed. The appellate issue was whether counting the pre-September 1, 1993 attempt as one of the attempts allowed pursuant to post-September 1, 1993 law was an unconstitutional retroactive application of former Tex. Occ. Code Ann. &sect; 155.056 (2004). The state appellate court reversed, holding that it was not. The limitation on exam attempts under the version of the statute in effect when the doctor applied for a license did not govern applications made prior to September 1, 2001. The statute did not annul or affect licenses granted before that date. Therefore, it affected antecedent conduct only in that it permitted consideration of exam attempts that took place prior to its effective date. Taking into account historical data did not, by itself, make the statute unconstitutionally retroactive. Moreover, it did not violate a vested right; there could be no reasonable expectation that requirements would not change. And, further, the Board's interpretation was entitled to deference.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the judgment of the trial court and rendered judgment in favor of the Board denying the doctor's request for declaratory relief. It remanded for a determination of what award of attorneys' fees, if any, was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The district court granted appellee Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's motion to dismiss. In the alternative, the district court granted the Commission's summary-judgment motion. The builder appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the builder had an application to build a landfill pending before the Commission, the Texas Legislature enacted Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 361.122 (Supp. 2004). The provisions of that section mandated that the builder's application be denied. On appeal, the court found that, because the Commission had neither exclusive nor primary jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 361.122, and because the builder showed a justiciable controversy existed that was sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the district court, the district court erred in dismissing the cause. Therefore, the district court had jurisdiction to consider the merits of the competing motions for summary judgment. As to the motions for summary judgment, because the classifications within Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 361.122 were reasonable, and because the law operated equally on all within the class, the section was not a prohibited local or special law. Therefore, summary judgment in favor of the Commission was proper.</SPAN></P>

The ranch filed a petition for review. The 38th Judicial District Court for Medina County, Texas, granted summary judgment in favor of the ranch, reversing the EAA's order and remanding the cause for consideration of the merits of the ranch's permit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ranch did not file its declaration until December 31, 1997. The Edwards Aquifer Act became effective on the date the Texas Supreme Court dissolved an injunction, making the deadline for filing the declarations of historical use December 30, 1996. The EAA asserted that when legislation was enacted affecting a general class of persons, those persons had received all process that they were constitutionally entitled to receive via the legislative process. The ranch argued that although it was not entitled to individualized notice when the Act was adopted, it was entitled to individualized notice before the EAA could implement the permit deadline resulting in a loss of the ranch's vested property rights. The appellate court ruled that the ranch received all constitutionally required notice. The ranch was charged with knowledge of the initial March 1994 deadline through the enactment and publication of the Act. The subsequent extensions of that deadline could only work to the ranch's benefit. The ranch was not entitled to individualized notice before the deadline for filing the permit application could be applied to its property right.</SPAN></P>

The patient did not learn of sponge until after July 2006, when she began experiencing abdominal pain and underwent exploratory surgery. The trial court held that the action was barred by the 10-year statute of repose of &sect; 74.251(b). On appeal, the court held that, as applied to the patient, &sect; 74.251(b) unreasonably restricted the patient's right to sue before she had a reasonable opportunity to discover the wrong and bring suit and therefore it was unconstitutional under the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, and reversed. The court held that Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.251(b) abrogated a well established common-law claim, and that it effectively abolished the patient's right to bring claims against appellees before there was a reasonable opportunity to discover the wrong and file suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiffs, a conglomerate of school districts, sued in the District Court, Travis County, 250th Judicial District (Texas), seeking that the trial court declare that the tax approved in the prior case on funding for education had become an unconstitutional state ad valorem tax. An intervenor moved for dismissal. The schools appealed the trial court's grant of the intervenor's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had not given the schools an opportunity to replead; however, it determined the alleged defect was of a type that amendment could not cure. The appellate court's review indicated the correctness of the trial court's determination that the schools either could not, or did not, seek to amend the pleadings. An allegation that the schools were forced to tax at the highest allowable rate to provide the bare, accredited education was a necessary element of a cause of action they brought in challenging the funding cap. Their pleading that they had to tax at the cap to educate their students did not refer to the state-imposed obligation to provide an accredited education, as such, they failed to state a challenge to the tax as a state tax. The enriched education that they, locally, desired to provide students was not the measure for determining if the state was imposing an educational mandate requiring them to levy a state-imposed rate of tax. Their pleadings simply failed to state a viable cause of action. Accordingly, the trial court properly dismissed the claim for failure to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After terminating two police officers, the city refused to participate in the arbitration step of the grievance process under the CBA. In a subsequent action filed by the officers, summary judgment was entered in their favor. In reversing, the appellate court noted that, if legislative power was delegated to a private entity, it reviewed with the presumption that the delegation was constitutional. Thereafter, the factors in Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation, Inc., were analyzed to determine if the presumption had been rebutted. Delegation was read narrowly to uphold validity if possible. Here, the citizens review committee was a private group exercising broad delegated powers. The powers were legislative in nature, even though were assigned by contract. It was noted that delegations to private entities were subject to more stringent requirements and less judicial deference than public delegations. The appellate court determined that six of the eight factors under Boll Weevil weighed heavily against a conclusion of constitutionality under Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 for an appeal to the committee, as described in a portion of the CBA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The court construed defendant's complaint as one challenging the constitutionality of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 24 (Supp. 2008). However, to preserve the issue for appeal under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1, defendant had to object on these grounds. His objection made about the exercise of the State's due diligence in serving the warrants for his arrest did not apprise the trial court that defendant claimed the statute was being applied to him in an unconstitutional manner. Given that defendant did not object, nothing was presented for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by a jury in municipal court for running a red light and making an illegal left turn.

The appellate court affirmed, holding that (1) notwithstanding the legislature's choice of the words &quot;establish&quot; and &quot;create&quot; in Tex. Gov't Code Ann.  &sect; 30.00082(a) (repealed), the legislation authorizing the creation of the Irving Municipal Court was neither an unconstitutional delegation of the legislature's inherent, nondelegable authority to &quot;establish such other courts as it may deem necessary&quot; under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's lounge, an investigator with the Texas Department of Public Safety played an &quot;eight-liner,&quot; a modified video machine, which the state labeled a gambling device, and obtained credits, which he was able to cash out for money orders with the bartender. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in: failing to include a mistake of fact instruction in the jury charge, failing to grant a mistrial, and failing to grant his motion to suppress. He also argued that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 47.01(4) was unconstitutional, because it was too vague. The appellate court held that defendant was not entitled to a mistake of fact instruction, because testimony only showed that he did not believe his conduct was illegal; the mistrial issue was waived and was not error, because the trial court gave a curative instruction regarding testimony about defendant's silence; &sect; 47.01(4) was constitutional, as the fact that certain law enforcement personnel may have misinterpreted a statute did not necessarily render it impermissibly vague; and the motion to suppress was properly denied because probable cause existed to believe that players of the eight-liners received a benefit.</SPAN></P>

A jury before the County Court at Law No. 2, Bexar County, Texas, awarded the allegedly injured party medical expenses. The financially responsible party appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The financially responsible party argued that the award's amount for past medical expenses should have been reduced because the medical providers accepted lesser amounts for their services, writing off the balance due. On the other hand, the allegedly injured party argued that he incurred the medical charges at the time of his doctor's visit and that any amounts later written off did not affect the charges that he incurred. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 41.0105 (Supp. 2006) required such a reduction. The appellate court agreed with the financially responsible party's interpretation of the statute. In construing the statute, the appellate court believed that &quot;medical or healthcare expenses incurred&quot; referred to the &quot;big circle&quot; of medical or healthcare expenses incurred at the time of the initial visit with the healthcare provider, while, as applied to the facts presented in the case, &quot;actually incurred&quot; referred to the &quot;smaller circle&quot; of expenses incurred after an adjustment of the healthcare provider's bill. The allegedly injured party no longer owed money to his health care providers. Section 41.0105 prevented the allegedly injured from recovering amounts &quot;written off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company sought review of a summary judgment from the 333rd District Court, Harris County (Texas), which denied the company's request for declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent appellee city from enforcing an ordinance that prohibited concrete-crushing operations in certain locations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the company's air quality permit application for a proposed concrete-crushing facility was pending, a school was built near the property. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality granted the permit, but the city denied a municipal permit under Houston, Tex., Code of Ordinances &sect;&sect; 21-167 to 21-170 (2007) because of the proximity to the school. The court held that the ordinance was not preempted under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 382.113(b) and Tex. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5 because it was consistent with, and did not make unlawful any acts authorized under, the Texas Clean Air Act. The ordinance governed land use, not air pollution, and thus did not conflict with the Commission's authority under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 382.002(a), 382.011(b), 382.023(a), 382.024 to decide under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 382.065 (2010) how a concrete-crushing facility would affect air quality. Although the ordinance was enacted after the company applied for the air quality permit, Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 245.002(a)(1), (b) did not prohibit the city from considering the ordinance because the land-use exception in Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 245.004(3) applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children resided with the maternal aunt for approximately two years before the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (the Department) removed the children based upon allegations of abuse.

Over nine months after the rights of the parents were terminated, the aunt filed a petition to adopt the children, and several months later the grandmother filed a plea in intervention in suit for adoption. The trial court dismissed the suit based on lack of standing. The appellate court ruled that appellants did not have standing to bring the petition for adoption. Appellants failed to file suit within ninety-days of the termination of the parental rights. Appellants sought adoption of the children, after the ninety-day period, but failed to obtain the consent of the managing conservator, the Department, to file an original petition for adoption. Also, equity could not provide standing where none existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sex offenders sought to enjoin all judicial proceeding currently being conducted under the terms of the Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act, Tex.

The 284th District Court, Montgomery County, Texas, denied the requested relief. The offenders appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In addition to their requested relief, the offenders also sought a judgment declaring the Act unconstitutional. On review, the appellate court held that distinguishing a class of sexually violent predators from violent criminals for the purpose of involuntary commitment did not violate equal protection rights under the U.S. Constitution. Further, the distinction between the requirements to establish dangerousness under the Act, compared to an ordinary civil commitment proceeding, was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. Due process did not mandate notice to the person sought to be committed of those preliminary procedures that preceded the petition's filing, the beginning of adversary proceedings; nor did the failure to give notice to those subject to the Act of procedures that occurred prior to the initiation of formal adversary proceedings violate equal protection. The statutory requirement that at the biennial review the judge make a probable cause finding before the person is entitled to a hearing was not a denial of equal protection or due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his obligation to register had expired by the time the registration statute was amended in 2005; therefore, the amendments did not apply to him. The appellate court found that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 62.001(5)(A) (Supp. 2011), art. 62.002(a) applied to defendant because he had a reportable conviction that occurred after September 1, 1970. Chapter 62 appeared to require defendant to register, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 62.051(a) (Supp. 2011). Defendant allegedly committed the offense of failure to comply with sex offender registration requirements in 2009; therefore, the &quot;savings clause,&quot; Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 62.11, would not apply to him. After the 2005 amendments to the sex-offender registration statute, defendant had a duty to register. The evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant violated the statute by not registering. The 2005 amendments were necessary to safeguard the public safety of the citizens of the state. The retroactive effect did not render it unconstitutional. The evidence concerning the jury's refusal to find on the affirmative defense of mistake of law was legally sufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a retaliatory-discharge case brought pursuant to Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 451.001-.003 (2006), appellant former employee challenged an order of the 190th District Court, Harris County, Texas, granting the plea to the jurisdiction filed by appellee former employer, a state university center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee conceded that the legislature had not consented to workers' compensation anti-retaliation suits against the employer. Instead, she argued the employer waived its sovereign immunity by seeking district court review of her workers' compensation award. The court observed that, in the workers' compensation case, the employer sought judicial review of the appeals panel's decision regarding compensability of the employee's injury. The employer never asserted a claim for monetary relief. In the case at bar, the employer was the defendant and had not asserted any claim for relief against the employee. Therefore, there could be no offset and no waiver of sovereign immunity. Prohibiting the employee from using the state courts to pursue her Tex. Lab. Code Ann. ch. 451 retaliatory discharge claim against the employer did not violate the state and federal equal protection, due process, and due course of law clauses. The case did not affect a fundamental right, and declining to waive a self-insuring university system's immunity from workers' compensation anti-retaliation suits had a rational relationship to the State's legitimate interest in conserving the university's resources.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant challenged a decision of the 248th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which denied him relief he requested in his application for a writ of habeas corpus against appellee State and refused to dismiss the criminal charge against him for the felony offense of online solicitation of a minor under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 33.021(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was accused of online solicitation of a minor under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 33.021(b). Appellant sought habeas corpus relief, challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The trial court denied appellant relief and refused to dismiss the charges. The court affirmed on appeal. Section &sect; 33.021(b) included a scienter requirement that applied to each element. The adult had to have the intent to arouse or gratify a sexual desire. The adult also had to intentionally communicate in a sexually explicit manner with a minor or distribute sexually explicit material to a minor. The legitimate goal of the statute exceeded any potential unlawful applications of the statute. Appellant's hypothetical scenarios did not render the statute overbroad. The court held that &sect; 33.021(b) was not facially invalid for overbreadth. Because the statute was sufficiently clear to provide adequate notice of what conduct constitutes a criminal offense, the statute was also not facially invalid for vagueness. Given the statute's target, the statute did not violate the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty in the 16th District Court of Denton County, Texas, to the offense of felony theft. He also pled true to the enhancement paragraphs and the trial court assessed his punishment at 18 years' confinement. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the trial court instructed the jury, it tracked Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(c) verbatim. Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion for new trial based on the allegation that the parole law instruction was confusing. He further contended that the statute was vague, confusing, and misleading to the jury, and that the jury engaged in misconduct by considering the parole law as it applied to him. The appellate court noted that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) set out, verbatim, the words that the trial judge was to use, and that because the trial court instructed the jury according to the legislative dictate of that statute, the trial court did not commit error. The appellate court held that defendant had not shown a reasonable likelihood that the jury misapplied the concepts of parole and good conduct time to assess a higher sentence than it would have otherwise assessed. The appellate court concluded that although the jury instruction on parole law was arguably confusing, the legislature mandated its inclusion in the jury charge on punishment and the appellate court would not invade the province of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the victim met at a bar. Defendant gave the victim a ride home, where she alleged defendant grabbed her by the throat and sexually assaulted her. The victim testified she was able to escape after defendant fell asleep and called police. The appellate court ruled that the evidence was factually sufficient to show that the victim did not consent to defendant's penetration of her anus. The fact that defendant remained in the apartment after the assault did not show that the victim consented to sexual intercourse with defendant, and defendant's use of lubrication to facilitate anal intercourse did not show consent. Also, the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that defendant placed the victim in fear of death or serious bodily injury. The jury could have found that a reasonable person in the victim's position would have been placed in fear of death or serious bodily injury, considering defendant grabbed the victim by the throat, threw her to the ground, and threatened to kill her. The record did not show that the victim lacked the ability to understand and remember her situation and circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient filed a health care liability claim against the doctor, alleging malpractice during the delivery of her son. However, the doctor lost his medical license and left the state before the patient filed suit. The patient was unable to locate the doctor to effect service of process but, months later, received leave to serve via publication. Although the doctor's whereabouts remained unknown, his insurance carrier hired an attorney to defend the suit. The attorney moved to dismiss on the basis that the patient failed to serve the expert witness report within 120 days of filing suit as required by Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code &sect; 74.351(a). On review, the court held that the 120-day requirement was mandatory, but even if a due diligence exception were afforded by the statute, it would be inapplicable in the instant case because the patient had four months of inactivity in her attempts to serve the doctor. The four-month gap in service activity established a lack of diligence on the part of the patient. She was thus not excused from strict compliance with the statutory service requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter was allegedly delivered in a serious condition and suffered severe brain damage due to lack of oxygen, and lives with permanent neurological injury and disability. The daughter was fourteen years old at the time the suit was filed. The appellate court ruled that Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.251(b) (2011) violated the open court provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 as applied to minors injured before their eighth birthday. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.251(b) effectively cut off a minor's cause of action before the minor was legally able to assert it, thereby requiring the minor to satisfy an impossible condition, and failed to provide an adequate substitute remedy. By putting a ten-year outer limit on the health care liability claims of minors injured before the age of eight, these minors will never be able to bring claims in their own right because the statute of repose cuts it off before they reach the age of majority. Also, since the medical liability claim belongs to the daughter, and not the mother, any lack of any due diligence on the part of the mother could not be attributed to the claims belonging to the daughter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murdering a fellow prison inmate by repeatedly stabbing him with a steel rod or &quot;shank.&quot; On appeal, defendant argued that because he was not eligible for release on mandatory supervision, the trial judge erred in giving the jury the instruction concerning good conduct time; informing the jury about good conduct time violated his due process rights; and defendant questioned what harm analysis, the Almanza standard or Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(a) concerning constitutional error, applied in the event the submission of the instruction was in error or unconstitutional. The proper standard for review was whether there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the challenged instruction unconstitutionally. The court of criminal appeals held that the parole law charge was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant, because defendant failed to demonstrate that there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury unconstitutionally misapplied the concept of &quot;good conduct time&quot; to assess a higher sentence as a result of the instruction, thereby denying defendant due process or due course of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother, individually and in her capacity as guardian of the person and estate of her disabled adult son (born in 1972), brought an action in 2009 against appellee, the alleged biological father, seeking parentage and child support determinations. The 306th District Court, Galveston County, Texas, dismissed the suit on statute-of-limitations grounds under the 1983 version of former Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.01. The mother sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that the statute of limitations did not bar the action because the residual four-year statute of limitations, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.051, applied in the absence of a more specific limitations provision, and the running of the limitations period was continuously tolled under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.001, due to the legal disability of unsound mind. The more specific statute of limitations in the 1983 version of former Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.01 did not apply retroactively because the statute was tolled by disability and therefore the suit had not been barred before the effective date. It was not necessary to decide whether Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 160.606 (which was in effect when suit was filed and allowed commencement at any time) could be applied retroactively. However, the court found that two factors would have weighed in favor of retroactive application: there was no settled expectation that a statute of limitations barred the action, and there was a compelling state interest in ensuring that the natural parents of a child assume primary responsibility for the child--including a disabled adult with no presumed father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient appealed from a partial summary judgment of the 17th District Court of Tarrant County (Texas) in favor of defendant health care providers in the patient's medical malpractice action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A colonoscopy revealed that the patient had stage IV colorectal cancer. The patient alleged that the providers were negligent in failing to screen her for colorectal cancer after she became 50 years old, misdiagnosing her rectal bleeding as stemming from hemorrhoids, failing to diagnose her cancer, and failing to order testing that would have revealed the cancer. The court held that the providers conclusively established their affirmative defense of limitations as to the patient's claims of negligence on four specific office visits. The patient's summary judgment evidence raised an issue of fact, however, concerning whether she had a reasonable opportunity to discover the providers' alleged wrongs or her alleged injury. The patient's hemorrhoids diagnosis made it impossible for her to learn of the providers' alleged wrongs, or her alleged injury, colon cancer. Thus, the open courts guarantee of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 precluded application of the limitations provision of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (repealed 2003) to cut off the patient's claims as a matter of law. The patient's four-month delay in filing suit after learning of her injury was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the partial summary judgment on the patient's negligent failure to diagnose claims, misdiagnosis claims, and negligent failure to order testing claims based on four office visits. The court affirmed the partial summary judgment concerning the patient's negligent-failure-to-screen-based-on-age claims and concerning the first office visit. The court affirmed the partial summary judgment for the practice on direct negligence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed orders of the County Criminal Court at Law No. 3, Harris County, Texas, denying relief in pretrial habeas corpus proceedings in which defendants challenged the constitutionality of Houston, Tex., Code of Ordinances, No. 97-75, under which each was being prosecuted with Class A misdemeanor offenses. The ordinance regulated sexually-oriented businesses and criminalized certain conduct by persons employed by those establishments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a culpable mental state was required to prove a violation of the ordinance; that is, offenses under the ordinance were not strict liability offenses. The ordinance was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. It conveyed a sufficient warning about the proscribed conduct when measured by a common understanding and practice. The ordinance's provisions regulating the conduct and permitting of entertainers were authorized under Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. ch. 243. Thus, the city properly made violations of those provisions punishable as Class A misdemeanors. The ordinance was not an unlawful expansion of the city's authority in violation of the limits set forth in the Texas Local Government Code and the doctrine of preemption, as claimed by defendants. Defendants had not carried their burden to show that the punishment range for a Class A misdemeanor was grossly disproportionate to the offense of violating the ordinance. Prosecuting violations of the ordinance as a Class A misdemeanor was justified to deter continuing violations of the ordinance that legislative bodies had determined leads to greater criminal activities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant medical providers sought review of a judgment from the 336th Judicial District Court, Fannin County (Texas), which denied their motion to dismiss appellee widower's medical malpractice action pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.351 for failure to serve expert reports.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the day of the deadline, the expert reports were timely filed, but service failed by reason of a facsimile transmission problem. The trial court granted a 30-day extension pursuant to &sect; 74.351(c). The court, in reversing, held that &sect; 74.351(c) applied only when a timely-served report did not meet the statutory definition of an expert report because it had one or more deficiencies in its contents; &sect; 74.351(c) did not apply to a report that was not served by the deadline. Thus, the trial court was bound by the mandatory dismissal provision of &sect; 74.351(b). The court also rejected an assertion that &sect; 74.351, as applied, denied the widower due process and due course of law pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The court observed that due process did not require prior notice that the law was serious about a clearly stated consequence. Mandatory dismissal was a clearly stated consequence for failing to comply with the statutory deadline, and Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.351 did not have to provide an exception geared toward last-minute misfortune in order to provide constitutionally adequate safeguards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Southwest Travis County Water District, challenged the judgment of the District Court of Travis County, 126th Judicial District (Texas) holding unconstitutional its constitutive statute, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 4243, in a declaratory judgment action brought by appellee, the City of Austin.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature intended 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 4243 to operate exclusively within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a single Texas municipality, appellee. The court held that none of the reasons suggested by appellant district amounted to a reasonable basis for singling out appellant district for special treatment. Therefore, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 4243 was not a general law. Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 59(e) required that each special law creating a conservation and reclamation district had to comply with the general laws then in effect relating to consent by political subdivisions of the districts. The court held that Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann.  &sect;42.023 (West 1999) was applicable and required that appellee had to give its written consent to extraterritorial jurisdiction. Therefore, the court held that 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 4243 was unconstitutional as a local law authorized by Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 59 because appellee did not consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; the court held that the disputed law was not a general law; thus, the law required appellee's consent to the creation of appellant district within its extraterritorial jurisdiction which it would not give; therefore, the law was unconstitutional as a local law and was struck down.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 11.001-11.055 (2002), and which dismissed his lawsuit against appellees, the attorney general, a county, an agency, and a city, after he failed to furnish court-ordered security.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen had a long history of filing lawsuits and appeals to contest the issuance and approval of bonds in the county related to the construction of new sports arenas in that locale. In affirming, the court held that the vexatious litigant statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it sufficiently outlined a standard of conduct and because a core of prohibited activity was well defined therein. Furthermore, the statute did not implicate the citizen's constitutional right to equal protection. The citizen's own pleadings belied his claim that he could not have known he was at risk of being held to be a vexatious litigant. He acknowledged that his underlying lawsuit asserted the same request for relief that had been included in one unsuccessful lawsuit or another continuously from 1998 through 2003 and should have known that there was no reasonable probability of success. The restrictions placed on the citizen were not unreasonable when balanced with the significant costs of defending his likely frivolous lawsuits in the future. The court disagreed with the citizen's claim that appellees failed to show there was no reasonable probability that he would prevail in his suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pawnbroker requested review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First District of Texas that reversed the trial court's dismissal of respondent's suit for conversion, negligence, and gross negligence arising from petitioner's inability to return pledged property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was unable to return a ring pledged by respondent because the ring had been stolen. Respondent rejected petitioner's offers of a like-kind replacement or a cash settlement and sued for conversion, negligence, and gross negligence. The trial court granted petitioner's plea to the jurisdiction, which claimed that Tex. Fin. Code Ann.  &sect; 371.167(a) of the Texas Pawnshop Act (Act of May 24, 1997, ch. 1008, &sect; 1, 1997 Tex.

Laws 4724, 4726) granted the Consumer Credit Commissioner primary and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes between pledgors and pawnbrokers concerning lost goods. The court of appeals reversed, holding that the Pawnshop Act provided an alternative, not an exclusive, remedy, and the court affirmed. Respondent was not required to seek a remedy under the Pawnshop Act before filing suit, so the commissioner did not have exclusive jurisdiction. Nor did the commissioner have primary jurisdiction, as there was no reason to defer to the commissioner's expertise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; the Texas Pawnshop Act in effect when respondent's suit was filed did not require respondent to exhaust administrative remedies and did not abrogate respondent's common-law claims, nor did the Consumer Credit Commissioner have primary jurisdiction over the dispute.</SPAN></P>

First, appellants argued &sect; 21.06 violated equal protection guarantees by discriminating both in regard to sexual orientation and gender. The court overruled this argument, because it found that 1) there was no fundamental right to engage in sodomy, 2) homosexuals did not constitute a &quot;suspect class,&quot; and 3) the prohibition of homosexual conduct advanced a legitimate state interest and was rationally related thereto, namely, preserving public morals. The court also found that while the statute may adversely affect the conduct of male and female heterosexuals, this did not raise the specter of gender-based discrimination. Second, appellants argued S 21.06 violated the right to privacy guaranteed by both the state and federal constitutions. The court overruled this argument, finding no constitutional &quot;zone of privacy&quot; shielding homosexual conduct from state interference.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant medical center sought review of a judgment from the District Court of Travis County, 250th Judicial District (Texas), which dismissed, for lack of standing, its declaratory claims challenging the constitutionality of two statutes. The judgment also ordered that the medical center take nothing against appellees, the State of Texas and others, and granted two intervenors affirmative declarations that the statutes were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The medical center provided services through a preferred provider organization to retired teachers in its area. Two competitors were included in this program, but not in another program for active school district employees. The challenged statutes were amended to prohibit the exclusion of the competitors from either program. Thereafter, one of the competitors was admitted into the program for active school district employees. The court held that the medical center lacked standing to assert a constitutional challenge because it had no contractual right to be the sole provider; rather, its contract expressly contemplated that the program administrator could contract with other hospital providers. Although the medical center argued that the program administrator would not have entered into such contracts but for the amendments, the court found this argument merely speculative. Because the medical center lacked standing, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate its claims. Although the medical center failed to brief an issue, thus waiving it under Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i), the court declined to award sanctions for a frivolous appeal under Tex. R. App. P. 45.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of the plea to the jurisdiction and the resulting dismissal for want of subject-matter jurisdiction; vacated the portion of the district court's judgment declaring the amendments constitutional, valid, and enforceable; dismissed the intervenors' claims; and modified the judgment to provide for a dismissal with prejudice instead of a take-nothing judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a nuclear power plant operator, sued appellant, the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, seeking a refund of tax payments made under the independently procured insurance tax, Tex. Ins. Code Ann. &sect; 101.053(b)(4) (Supp. 2006), on grounds that the tax was unconstitutional and violated the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The District Court of Travis County, 126th Judicial District, Texas, granted the operator summary judgment. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the Comptroller argued that the trial court erred because the State was authorized to collect the independently procured insurance tax (the tax) consistent with due process; equal protection; and the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1011 et seq. The appellate court agreed. The tax, as applied to the operator, did not violate either due process or the McCarran-Ferguson Act because the operator was a Texas-based corporation. The taxes for each year at issue, 2002-04, were collected pursuant to insurance contracts that originated, and were negotiated and approved, in Texas. Losses were payable to the owners of the nuclear plant. The tax did not violate the equal protection guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1-2, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, and Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, because the operator did not show that the Comptroller selectively enforced the tax only against domestic corporations. Finally, the statutory scheme imposing the tax was not arbitrary and capricious or unconstitutionally vague. The operator did not argue that the statutory requirements were unconstitutionally vague, and the Comptroller's reporting requirements mirrored the statutory requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's summary judgment and rendered judgment in favor of the Comptroller.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their divorce case, the mother and the father had disputed his access to their daughter. After the father committed suicide, the child's paternal grandfather petitioned for visitation with her. Under interim orders, the grandfather was ordered to, and did, obtain grief or anger-management counseling. Before the final hearing, the mother had given the grandfather visitation in excess of what the trial court had ordered. At trial, she testified that contact with the grandfather was in her daughter's best interest. The trial court granted the grandfather visitation on alternate weekends and in the summer. The mother appealed; the appellate court affirmed. The mother did not show that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the grandfather visitation. Though on appeal she claimed the grandfather posed a threat to her daughter, this was inconsistent with positions she had taken earlier. There was no testimony that the grandfather had in any way mistreated the child; his alleged bad acts were years in the past and he had received counseling since then. Nor was Tex. Fam. Code Ann.  &sect; 153.433 (West Supp. 2001) unconstitutional on its face, or as applied in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed an appeal from the judgment of the Criminal District Court, No. 1, Tarrant County (Texas) that denied his petition for writ of habeas corpus in relation to sex offender registration requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued, inter alia, that the sex offender registration requirements of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 62.101 violated substantive due process by imposing on him a compulsory initial registration without any individualized assessment of how dangerous he was or his likelihood of re-offending. The court of appeals disagreed. To the extent that the registration requirements' rational relationship to the State's legitimate interest in protecting its citizens from sex offenders diminished over time, it provided a vehicle for an offender to obtain an individualized assessment of dangerousness and risk of recidivism and possibly obtain early release from his obligation to register as a sex offender. The initial compulsory registration requirement was rationally related to and furthered a legitimate state interest. It contained a mechanism that allowed sex offenders who were purportedly not dangerous and who posed a low risk of re-offending to petition for early termination of the registration requirements. The record was thus insufficient to rebut the presumption that art. 62.101 was constitutional as applied to appellant.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 3, 3a, 6, 8, 27, and whether it violated the Texas Religious Freedom Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 110.001-.012 (2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sinton, Tex., Ordinance No. 1999-02 regulated the location of certain correctional and rehabilitation facilities. The pastor owned two homes that were operated to provide housing for parolees and probationers. In affirming, the court noted that an individual's religious beliefs did not excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State was free to regulate. Because the ordinance was a valid law prohibiting conduct that the city was free to regulate, and because it was generally applicable to any person desiring to operate correctional or rehabilitation facilities, appellants' claims that their freedom of religion rights were violated lacked merit. Nothing in the record established that the city adopted the ordinance to regulate speech because it disagreed with the Christian message the pastor was conveying or with his motivation to clothe, house, and feed the needy. The purpose of the legislation was not to stifle speech, but rather to protect the public by regulating the location of correctional and rehabilitation facilities. Because appellants' religious rights were not substantially burdened by the ordinance, the Act had not been violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged a decision of the 304th Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas), which, on a petition filed by appellee Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, terminated her parental rights and denied her motion for a new trial under Tex. R. Civ. P. 329.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother raised certain issues on appeal, but the court affirmed the termination of her parental rights. The mandatory language of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 161.211 left no room for a construction other than a requirement that any collateral or direct attack on the termination of parental rights, including a motion for new trial, had to be filed no more than six months after the termination order was signed. The court's interpretation of the statutory language of &sect; 161.211 was consistent with the interpretation by other courts of similar language in Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 162.012(a). The six-month deadline in Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 161.211 was not a plea in avoidance, but was a bar to or preclusion of a challenge to a termination order more than six months after the termination order was signed. The court disagreed that the six-month deadline was a statute of limitations affirmative defense that was waived if not pleaded or presented to a trial court. The mother did not argue that her rights were violated or otherwise challenge the constitutionality of the statute and, therefore, she had not preserved or presented the issue for review under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.12 (Supp. 2005) was facially unconstitutional, granted defendant's application for a writ of habeas corpus, and dismissed the indictment of defendant under &sect; 21.12, which prohibited Texas primary and secondary school employees from engaging in sexual conduct with students enrolled at a school where they work.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the indictment against defendant, holding that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.12 was unconstitutional because &sect; 21.12 criminalized sexual conduct not only with minor students, but also with students who were above the age of legal consent. On appeal, the court held that it had jurisdiction to hear the State's appeal because although the State could not appeal an adverse ruling in a habeas proceeding, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.01(a)(1) authorized the State to appeal the dismissal of an indictment. The court found that &sect; 21.12 did not implicate a fundamental right because the concept of privacy rights had not been extended to all adult sexual conduct or intimate relationships generally. The court held that &sect; 21.12 did not violate defendant's due process or equal protection rights because &sect; 21.12 was rationally related to the legitimate state interest in protecting minor students from sexual abuse and exploitation; and the differential treatment of school employees who were married to students versus those who were not also had a rational basis. Also defendant failed to show that &sect; 21.12 was void for vagueness or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

Util. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 54.259-.261 (1998), were unconstitutional. The District Court of Travis County, 353rd Judicial District, Texas, declared the Statutes constitutional. The building owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the building owners contended the Statutes caused a taking of their property without providing an adequate procedure for determining compensation, the Commission lacked the power to determine compensation, and, even if the Commission had that power, it resulted from an unconstitutional delegation. The appellate court disagreed, holding that the legislature designed the Statutes to balance the forces of competition and consumer choice with the rights of property owners to be compensated in the event of a taking. The Statutes expressly delegated to the Commission the power to establish a procedure whereby the building owners could obtain adequate compensation. The provisions granting the Commission jurisdiction to enforce the Statutes delegated to the Commission the power to determine &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;nondiscriminatory&quot; compensation when a property owner and telecommunications utility failed to negotiate the amount. Because a lack of adequate procedures to establish compensation was a necessary element to establish a claim under the takings doctrine, the building owners could not have a takings claim until they availed themselves of the Commission's procedures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers, a husband and wife, challenged orders of the 45th Judicial District Court, Bexar County, Texas, granting summary judgment in favor of appellees, an appraisal district, an appraisal review board, and a chief appraiser, in the taxpayers' action that challenged the district's removal of the disabled veteran tax exemption from property the taxpayers owned after the district discovered the husband was no longer a Texas resident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband was a 100 percent permanently disabled United States Army veteran. The court held that in order to be entitled to receive the disabled veteran tax exemption, a disabled veteran had to meet Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 11.22(g) (Supp. 2011)'s Texas residency requirement. Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2(b) did not create a vested property right in the disabled veteran tax exemption, given the permissive nature of &sect; 2(b) and the fact that it was legislatively revocable. The Texas Legislature had authority to impose Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 11.22(g)'s residency requirement. Section 11.22(g)'s residency requirement was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. Accordingly, neither the husband's equal protection rights nor his due process rights were violated. The district and the chief appraiser were not equitably estopped from removing the disabled veteran tax exemption from the taxpayers' property. The chief appraiser had legal authority to remove the tax exemption from the taxpayers' property, and he correctly concluded that, as a nonresident of Texas, the husband was not entitled to the disabled veteran tax exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with capital murder, and the State gave notice of its intent to seek the death penalty. Defendant filed an &quot;Amended Motion to Declare Article 37.071, &sect; 2 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Unconstitutional as Applied.&quot; Respondent, the trial judge of the 177th District Court in Harris County (Texas), commenced an evidentiary hearing on defendant's motion. The State petitioned for mandamus and prohibition relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found defendant was appearing to seek a pretrial ruling from the trial judge that the State was not entitled to proceed with its capital-murder indictment because it was within the realm of possibility that he could be wrongfully convicted and wrongfully sentenced to death if convicted. Because Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.01 did not provide for an appeal by the State of an interlocutory pretrial ruling preventing the State from pursuing a capital-murder conviction and sentence of death, the State had no adequate remedy at law concerning the resolution of defendant's motion. A writ of mandamus or prohibition thus was an appropriate vehicle to review the propriety of defendant's motion and the trial judge's evidentiary hearing. Because there was no basis under Texas law to conduct a pretrial evidentiary hearing to determine the &quot;as applied&quot; constitutionality of a state penal or criminal procedural statute, the trial judge did not have legal authority to conduct any such pretrial evidentiary hearing and make any such pretrial declaratory judgment. He was acting beyond the scope of his lawful authority. Therefore, the State had demonstrated a clear right to relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court conditionally granted the State mandamus and prohibition relief. If he did not do so himself, the court would order the trial judge to dismiss defendant's amended motion as requesting an unauthorized declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employer sought review of an order from the Court of Appeals for the Eighth District of Texas, which upheld the denial of the employer's plea to the jurisdiction in an action by respondent employee claiming the employer fired him for taking personal medical leave under the self-care provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2612(a)(1)(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the employer, a State of Texas university. He sustained an on-the-job injury to his left elbow. He went on leave for approximately nine months. The employer terminated him less than one month after he returned to work. He brought an action against the employer under the FMLA. The employer filed a plea to the jurisdiction, contending it was barred by sovereign immunity. The trial court denied the plea. The court of appeals upheld the decision. On review, the court held that the State could not be sued under the FMLA's self-care provision. As for abrogation, nothing in the legislative record suggested that gender bias by the states was the constitutional evil underlying the self-care provision. The United States Congress exceeded its abrogation authority under &sect; 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 5, when it subjected states to private-damage suits under the self-care provision. A stray line in the employer's policy manual that employees could &quot;bring a civil action against an employer&quot; was insufficient to waive State immunity. The trial court erroneously denied the employer's plea to the jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and dismissed the FMLA claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant buyer sought review of a summary judgment of the 115th Judicial District Court, Marion County (Texas), in favor of appellee seller in the buyer's action to recover liquidated damages under Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 5.077 based on the seller's failure to provide an annual report on certain financial details of the parties' executory contract of sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that &sect; 5.077, as applied, violated Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The court agreed that Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 5.077 was constitutionally suspect as a possible impairment of the obligation of the parties' contract. As amended in 2001, the language of &sect; 5.077, considered alone, could exact on the parties' contract a penalty grossly in excess of the value of the entire contract, which financed little more than five percent of the potential penalty. Section 5.077 also potentially imposed an excessive fine, in violation of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 41.004(a) provided, however, that, before exemplary damages could be recovered, more-than-nominal actual damages had to be awarded to the claimant. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 41.008(b) also limited such exemplary damages to no more than the greater of (a) $ 200,000, or (b) any noneconomic damages found by a jury not to exceed $ 750,000, plus double the amount of economic damages. Those restrictions would dramatically limit the Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 5.077 penalty and impose as a condition precedent that actual damages be proven, thus making &sect; 5.077 constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient argued, inter alia, that probate court's findings of fact and conclusions of law were insufficient to deprive him of his &quot;liberty&quot; from forced medication because the probate court did not find that he was dangerous. The court of appeals disagreed. The patient was not released on bail but committed to the hospital. A psychiatrist testified to the patient's present mental condition and his threats at the hospital &quot;to get us all killed,&quot; and that he was &quot;confrontational with other patients&quot; and &quot;with the staff.&quot; The patient's mother testified that she had daily contact with her son over the last year and that he could be a danger to himself and others because he &quot;stopped the medication.&quot; Based on that evidence, the court of appeals could presume a finding of dangerous in support of the probate court's order. The psychiatrist's application to medicate the patient was brought as part of the patient's treatment program in an inpatient mental health facility--not solely to render the patient competent to stand trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent purchasers brought actions under multiple theories, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, against petitioner automobile manufacturer and distributors. Respondents alleged petitioners' actions in removing spray primer from the paint process caused the paint to prematurely peel on particular vehicles purchased by respondents. The trial court identified the class as those individuals whose vehicles had suffered or would suffer peeling because of defective paint or who had petitioners' repairs because of defective paint. The appellate court modified the class because the trial court's definition would have required a determination of the merits. It defined the class as those who had problems or had repairs because the alleged peeling was due to defective paint. Petitioners appealed. The court established it had jurisdiction, then reversed and remanded the case. The court held that neither court met the requirement that the class be clearly ascertainable by reference to objective criteria.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-husband sought review of an order of the 312th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which granted judgment for child-support arrearages in favor of appellee ex-wife and denied the ex-husband's motion for new trial. The ex-husband asserted, in part, that the underlying child-support judgment was dormant and had not been timely revived and that an amendment to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 158.102 (2002) violated his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The divorce decree required the ex-husband to pay to the ex-wife monthly child support each month, but he never paid any support. The court first noted that the 1980 divorce decree, which ordered him to pay support, was not a child-support judgment. Thus, because the ex-husband's child-support arrearages were not reduced to a judgment until July 2003, his dormancy argument pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 34.001 (1997) failed. The court next determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the ex-husband's motion for new trial based on the defenses of waiver and laches where he did not present evidence to establish those defenses at the hearing on the ex-wife's motion for enforcement. Finally, the court rejected the ex-husband's argument that the amendment to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 158.102 (2002) violated his due-process and due-course-of-law rights as well as protections against retroactive laws under the United States Constitution and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The court held that legislation amending statutes to extend time limits within which enforcement of an existing child-support liability could be effected did not violate &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The risk pool, which provided workers' compensation benefits to municipal employees in more than 1,600 Texas cities, contended on appeal that Tex.

VIII, &sect; 1-e , because they either required Texas cities to make gratuitous payments of public money, or because they imposed a statewide ad valorem tax. The supreme court held that the provisions were constitutional. Disagreeing with the court of appeals, the supreme court held that Tex. Lab.

The supreme court held that the challenged provisions did not require the risk pool to gratuitously grant public money, because the member cities received consideration from the fund, and the provisions served a legitimate public purpose with a clear public benefit. It also held that the challenged provisions did not effectively levy a 100 percent ad valorem tax on the unclaimed death benefits, but only transferred unclaimed benefits that the risk pools' member cities already committed to paying workers' compensation claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) challenged a decision from the 300th District Court, Brazoria County, Texas, which dismissed a termination of parental rights proceeding filed against appellee parents. A motion to dismiss the appeal was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit affecting the parent and child relationship (SAPCR), the parental grandparents of a minor child were given a temporary managing conservatorship. Termination proceedings against the parents were dismissed, and the DFPS appealed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that a dismissal of the appeal was not warranted. There was a final, appealable order under former Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.401(d) due to the entry of the order concerning the grandparents. Next, former &sect; 263.401 did not violate the separation of powers clause under Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. There was no unconstitutional interference with the State's performance of its prosecutorial function. In enacting the 12-month dismissal date for State-initiated termination proceedings, the Texas Legislature was not attempting to speed up the prosecutor's preparation and ultimate readiness for trial. Rather, it was providing guidelines for assuring that Texas children were returned to their parents or adopted as quickly as possible. Refiling the SAPCR with new facts demonstrating that the return of the child to the parents would endanger him did not unduly interfere with the State's prosecutorial function.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant disrupted a Presidential speech by standing up and shouting, causing the U.S. President to stop speaking, substantially impairing the ordinary conduct of the meeting. On appeal the State argued that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.05 was not impermissibly vague, it gave police officers and others of ordinary intelligence reasonable notice of what was proscribed. The instant court concluded the Court of Appeals did not err in concluding the curtailment of others' First Amendment rights was not intended to be included as a part of the narrowing construction expounded in caselaw. The statute was not vague on its face. It did not require police officers or citizens to know and apply delicate issues of First Amendment jurisprudence. It simply prohibited individuals from intentionally engaging in behavior that disrupted or prevented the ordinary conduct of a meeting. As the Third Court of Appeals correctly asserted, whether a person's conduct substantially impaired the ordinary conduct of a meeting was an objective standard that did not acquire its meaning from a particular officer's determination of what constituted substantial impairment.</SPAN></P>

Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 61.304, .313 (1996 &amp; Supp. 2003). The District Court of Travis County, 200th Judicial District, Texas, ruled unconstitutional the provision regulating the use of the term &quot;seminary&quot; and upheld the regulation of the granting of degrees. The school appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the school contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred by failing to declare Tex. Educ.

Code Ann. &sect; 61.313(a)(1) (Supp. 2003) a violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6, 8, 29. The appellate court ruled that the regulation of the term &quot;seminary&quot; under Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 61.313 (Supp. 2003) was content-neutral and served a significant governmental interest. Further, &sect; 61.313 was narrowly tailored to further the board's interest in preventing the fraudulent use of academic terms by private postsecondary institutions; it did not violate the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. The appellate court also ruled that Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 61.304 (1996) satisfied all three requirements of Lemon and did not violate the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution by fostering excessive government entanglement with religion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the County Court at Law No. 4 of Nueces County, Texas, convicting her of offending a state law prohibiting the sale of obscene devices, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(c)(1) (2003) and offending a municipal ordinance prohibiting the operation of a sexually oriented business without a permit, Corpus Christi, Tex., Code of Ordinances ch. 48, art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a sales clerk at an adult store, was arrested and convicted for selling a vibrator to an undercover police officer. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23 was unconstitutional based on a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit because the court was required to follow the ruling of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals that &sect; 43.23 did not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the ordinance was not inconsistent with Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. ch. 243 because: (1) ch. 243 did not contain a series of State-enforced regulations but rather a series of regulatory proposals that local governments could copy; (2) the ordinance did not conflict with the legislative intent of ch. 243; and (3) the fact that a business owner could be required to obtain a permit under the ordinance's definition of a sexually oriented business but would not have been required to do so under the more limited scope of ch. 243's definition did not automatically warrant the conclusion that a conflict existed. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant originally appealed her conviction, claiming that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the aggregate weight of the substance possessed was more than 200 grams and that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.002(5) was unconstitutional. The appellate court was directed to conduct a statutory construction analysis of the statute. The appellate court affirmed. On review, the court agreed that the appellate court did not undertake a sufficient statutory construction analysis and the court resolved the issues, affirming the conviction. The appellate court failed to determine whether the language in &sect; 481.002(5) produced an absurd result, namely defendant's conviction. In addressing the matter, the court found no absurd result. The toxic liquid mixed with the methamphetamine in this case was a necessary part of the manufacturing process. It did not lead to an absurd result to include the unusable toxic liquids in the aggregate weight of the controlled substance. Under the statute, evidence indicating that a mixture contained a controlled substance was sufficient to support the conviction for possession in an amount equal to the aggregate weight of the mixture.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the voter waived his ground for disqualification when he filed it after the trial court had already heard the parties' motions for summary judgment and signed the interlocutory order on the motions for summary judgment. Because no party timely instituted a contest to the 2005 local option election, it was conclusively presumed that the election was valid and binding in all respects on all counts. The 2009 local option election held in current Precinct 2 was not void.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, appellant insurers challenged a judgment of the District Court of Travis County (Texas) that denied the insurers' motion for summary judgment in their declaratory action and held that a rule of appellee Texas Department of Insurance that required the insurers to rebate reinsurance surpluses to policyholders was valid. The policyholders had filed suit against the insurers seeking a share of the surpluses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurers claimed that Texas Department of Insurance Order No. 97-0738 (the 1997 rule) that required the insurers to rebate reinsurance surpluses in 1991 and 1992 to policyholders deprived them of their contractual rights, of property without due process, and was an unconstitutional retroactive law. The court found that the 1997 rule implemented the directive of former Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 5.76-2, &sect; 4.04 that deficits and surpluses of the Texas Workers' Compensation Assigned Risk Facility were to be passed on to policyholders. The court held that the 1997 rule and the factors specified in Department letters did not unconstitutionally impair the insurers' contractual rights because they could not have reasonably expected that they could retain the surpluses after they had been relieved of the obligation of covering the deficits. The court found that the 1997 rule did not deprive the insurers' of property without due process and was not an unconstitutional retroactive law because it rationally furthered the legitimate state purpose of preserving the workers' compensation market and there was no prior law that allowed insurers to pass through deficits and retain surpluses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff shareholder sued defendant directors on behalf of defendant corporation under Tex. Bus. Corp. Act Ann. art. 5.14 (2003). He amended his pleadings to add himself individually as a party plaintiff and to seek the appointment of a receiver over the corporation. The 416th Judicial District Court, Collin County, Texas, denied his motion for a receiver, and dismissed his derivative claim. He appealed in his representative capacity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among the various challenges to article 5.14, raised by the shareholder, all of which were rejected by the appellate court, he argued that the statute was unconstitutional, both facially and as applied to his circumstances. Like his other claims, there was no merit to his constitutional claims. Article 5.14 did not violate the separation of powers guarantee in Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, because it did not unconstitutionally delegate judicial power to a nonjudicial officer--i.e., the special litigation committee--without appropriate safeguards or opportunity for judicial review. Nor did the statute violate the due process of law guarantee in Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, because the shareholder did not have a property interest at stake, and any recovery in the derivative action belonged to the corporation. The statute did not violate the guarantee of equal protection in Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Nor did it violate the open court's provision in Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13; or the guarantee of trial by jury in Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 15, since his action was in equity, not in law. The shareholder waived appellate review of his remaining constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>

Util. Code Ann. &sect; 39.001(e) of the Public Utilities Regulation Act, adopted the Wholesale Market Oversight Rule (WMO Rule), 16 Tex. Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission established the WMO Rule to articulate standards that the Commission would apply in monitoring the activities of those participating in the wholesale electricity markets. The Commission defined the duties of market participants and those activities which were prohibited. The court held that the Commission possessed the statutory authority to enact the WMO Rule under Tex. Util. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 35.004(e) and 39.157 (Supp. 2004-2005). The WMO Rule balanced the competing statutory obligations of establishing a competitive market for electricity and ensuring safe, reliable, and reasonably priced power for consumers and ancillary services by allowing market forces to set the price of electricity but prohibiting market manipulation and activities that would materially affect reliability. The rule was not unconstitutionally vague. The broad language in the definition of prohibited activities was tempered by the availability of a defense when a market participant had acted in accordance with Electric Reliability Council of Texas protocols or had pursued a legitimate business purpose and exercised due diligence to avoid an adverse effect on prices, reliability, and accounting.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Commission's order adopting the rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth Court of Appeals, Bexar County (Texas), reversed defendant's conviction of two counts of harassment under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07, holding that the terms &quot;annoy,&quot; &quot;alarm,&quot; &quot;abuse,&quot; &quot;torment,&quot; &quot;embarrass,&quot; and &quot;repeated&quot; contained in &sect; 42.07(a)(4) and (a)(7) were unconstitutionally vague. The State petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 42.07(a)(4) did not implicate the free-speech guarantee of the First Amendment because it was directly only at people who, with the specific intent to inflict emotional distress, repeatedly used the telephone to invade another person's personal privacy, and did so in a manner reasonably likely to inflict emotional distress. Therefore, the conduct falling within &sect; 42.07(a)(4) would usually be essentially noncommunicative conduct, even if the conduct included spoken words, as people whose conduct violated the statute would not have an intent to engage in the legitimate communication of ideas, opinions, or information but rather would have only the intent to inflict emotional distress for its own sake. To the extent that &sect; 42.07(a)(4) was susceptible of application to communicative conduct, it was susceptible of such application only when that conduct was not protected by the First Amendment because it invaded the privacy interests of the victim in an intolerable manner. Because &sect; 42.07(a)(4) did not implicate the First Amendment, defendant was required to show that it was unduly vague as applied to his own conduct; as he failed to do so, his vagueness challenge failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, accused, was charged with the offense of unlawfully carrying a firearm, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.02 (2003), and filed a pretrial application for writ of habeas corpus, seeking dismissal of the charge. The Criminal District Court No. 3 for Dallas County, Texas, denied the accused the relief he sought, and the accused appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused argued that the trial court erred in denying him the requested relief on the grounds that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.02 was unconstitutional. The accused asserted that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.02 violated the Second Amendment, as that amendment was applied to the State of Texas through the Fourteenth Amendment. The State responded that the accused's concession that existing case law out of the U.S. Supreme Court was contrary to his position ended the analysis and that the appellate court was bound by the Supreme Court's pronouncement on the issue. The appellate court agreed with the State's argument, as the Supreme Court stated that the Second Amendment guaranteed no right to keep and bear a firearm that did not have some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia. Also, the appellate court observed no reason to depart from holdings by the federal courts of appeals that the Ninth Amendment did not provide a separate individual right to bear arms. Furthermore, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.02 bore a rational relationship to the State's interest in preventing crime and was not overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended the 1999 amendments to the Texas Sex Offender Registration Program (Act), Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.  art. 62.01 et seq. (Vernon Supp. 2001) requiring registration as a sex offender violated the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution. Defendant exposed himself to an eight-year-old child in May 1999. The public disclosure amendments were effective September 1999. The appeals court initially concluded the Texas Legislature did not have a primary intent to punish sex offenders by enacting the 1999 amendments to the Act. In other words, the amended disclosure provisions did not transform what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty. The amended disclosure provisions imposed no specific affirmative disability or restraint on the offender. The limitations on public disclosure in the Act strongly indicated that the Act is tailored to address specific governmental interests of public protection. The appeals courts ultimately found the Act and its 1999 amendments did not violate the ex post facto clause.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37.001-.011 (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendants, alleging that H.B. 1, 79th Leg. (Tex. 2005) was unconstitutional because its appropriation caused defendants to exceed the aggregate biennial cap on the rate of growth of appropriations under Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 22 and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 316.001 (2005). On appeal the court held that the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs' claim that H.B. 1 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers because the only delegation of legislative power that plaintiffs attacked was merely an assignment of duties within the legislative branch akin to each chamber's referral of bills to committees prior to consideration before the entire chamber. The district court erred by dismissing plaintiffs' claims seeking declarations that future expenditures under H.B. 1 would be unconstitutional.&nbsp;Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 22 was self-executing to the extent of prohibiting legislative action inconsistent with its provisions, and plaintiffs claims of violations did not present non-justiciable political questions. The dispositive issues controlling whether plaintiffs had validly pleaded each theory was not raised, briefed, or developed in the district court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment dismissing plaintiffs' claim alleging unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers for want of jurisdiction was affirmed. To the extent that plaintiffs' remaining two claims sought declarations that future expenditures under H.B.1's appropriation were unconstitutional or illegal, the district court abused its discretion in dismissing those claims, and those portions of the district court's judgment were reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of operating a motor vehicle without proof of financial responsibility and without current registration in a bench trial to the municipal court. The county criminal court of appeals affirmed. The appellate court affirmed, holding that Tex. Code Crim. P.

The appellate court further rejected appellant's argument that the Garland Municipal Court of Record Act (Act) denied him due process by its very &quot;complexity,&quot; holding that the Act simplified the process for the appellant by containing in a single statute most of the rules and procedures needed by an appellant to the county court whereas the procedures for appeals from municipal courts not of record are spread over a myriad of statutes and rules.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. VIII, &sect; 22(a) and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 316.001 (2005). The district court granted defendants' plea to the jurisdiction. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appropriation bill made certain school funding appropriations. Plaintiffs alleged that the bill caused the rate of growth of appropriations to exceed the aggregate biennial cap under Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 22(a) and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 316.001. Plaintiffs claimed that the method used under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 316.002 (2005) for establishing the cap was inconsistent with Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 22(a); they also claimed that delegation of authority to the LBB violated separation-of-powers limitations and that the additional appropriations exceeded even the LBB's calculations of the cap. The court of appeals found that Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 22 was self-executing to the extent of prohibiting legislative action inconsistent with its standards, and plaintiffs' claims that the standards had been violated did not present a non-justiciable political question. Plaintiffs could not allege a violation of separation of powers based on assignments of duties within the legislative branch. Taxpayer standing existed to challenge future expenditures under the appropriation. However, plaintiffs failed to sufficiently allege associational standing on the part of the organization.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's judgment was affirmed as to plaintiffs' separation-of-powers claim; the judgment was reversed as to the remaining claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been placed on deferred adjudication supervision for five years following his guilty plea to attempted sexual assault. As a condition of supervision, defendant was required to register as a sex offender under the provisions of the Texas Sex Offender Registration Program. Eight months before defendant was successfully discharged from supervision, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 62.11, 62.12(b)(2) (Vernon Supp. 2002) were amended to include defendant in a class of persons required to register for 10 years after release. Defendant registered during the time he was on supervision and for a brief period afterwards, but argued that the requirement that he continue to register violated the provisions of Tex. Const. art.1, &sect; 16, against retroactive laws. The appellate court held that the amendments were not unconstitutional as applied to defendant. The program was remedial in nature, not punitive, and defendant's rights did not vest until his release from supervision. As the amendments took effect prior to defendant's release, they were not retroactive as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

The Commission argued on appeal that the trial court erred in determining that the enactment of &sect; 32.03(k) violated the single subject rule of Article III. On review, the court reversed, concluding by required liberal construction under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 311.021(1) that &sect; 32.03(k) did not violate the single subject rule because the bill all related, at least indirectly, under the common subject of government reform as required by the bill's title. The fact that the bill covered many different codes and areas of law did not violate the requirement of Article III, &sect; 35, that the bill contain no more than one subject.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board passed rules that allowed practicing orthotics to obtain licenses under the Act through exemptions from licensing requirements. The orthotics were each denied licenses under the grandfather exemption pursuant to Tex. Occ.

They also filed the declaratory judgment action, claiming that the Board exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating those rules. The trial court granted summary judgment to the Board, finding that the rules were valid. On appeal, the court found that 22 Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 821.2(8) (2003), as well as former 22 Tex. Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 821.11 and 821.13 (2003), were invalid because they included qualifications, such as experience in fabricating orthoses, which were not in harmony with the purposes of the Act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a water district and others, challenged a summary judgment entered by the District Court of Travis County, 200th Judicial District, Texas, for appellee water system in the system's suit seeking a declaration that the district was prohibited from expanding its political boundaries and service area past certain geographical limits described in its enabling statute, as amended by Senate Bill 1494, Tex. Gen. Laws 1593 (SB 1494).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the system alleged that the district's actions were void and because the system, in seeking to provide water-utility services in the same area as the district, was an affected person, the court found that the system had standing to bring its suit for declaratory judgment. The court held that the enactment of SB 1494 did not violate the Texas Constitution. SB 1494 did not add additional land to the district's political territory or alter its taxing authority. As a result, SB 1494 was not subject to the notice provisions of Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 59. In light of the legislature's restriction in SB 1494 of the district's water service to areas &quot;within the district,&quot; the legislative history indicating that the phrase &quot;within and without&quot; was considered and subsequently abandoned, and the repeal of the only procedures for expansion available under the district's enabling statute, 1945 Tex. Gen. Laws 491, the court concluded that the district's political boundaries and service area were restricted to the geographic area described in the enabling statute, as amended by &sect; 3 of SB 1494.</SPAN></P>

The survivors produced no evidence of wilful and wanton negligence. The doctors argued that because the decedent was in a medical emergency when he arrived at the hospital, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.153 (2005) applied, and the case could not be maintained without evidence of wilful and wanton negligence. The survivors challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 74.153 on equal protection grounds. The court held that the application of &sect; 74.153 did not violate the equal protection guarantee of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 because a rational basis existed for imposing a lower standard of care when a patient was receiving emergency care. Because a medical malpractice crisis was interfering with the overall delivery of health-care services and because there were additional issues unique to emergency medical services, the legislature could appropriately address these concerns by lowering the standard of care for emergency medical services. The legislature could rationally determine that increased availability of emergency care would result.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing before the court, the trial court found that appellant juvenile engaged in delinquent conduct by committing two instances of indecency with a child.

Appellant complained the Sex Offender Registration Program violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection of the laws. The court affirmed. After applying a rational basis test, the court concluded the registration and notification statutes bore a rational relationship to the State's interests. Appellant's right to equal protection of the laws was not violated merely because he was treated differently from another person who commits different, although similar, conduct charged under a different statute. Because appellant was treated the same as all similarly situated nonviolent sex offenders for purposes of the duration of the registration requirements, appellant's argument failed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a decision from the 359th District Court, Montgomery County, Texas, which convicted him of failing to register, as required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 62.051(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of failing to register based on a failure to report within 7 days. He entered a plea agreement, but then appealed based on the constitutionality of the sex offender registration statute. He contended that certain 1999 and 2005 amendments violated Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the amendments at issue did not assign sufficient criminal or penal consequences to transform the statute into a criminal sanction. The registration requirement that appellant was convicted of violating existed in the 1998 version of the sex offender registration statute when appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault. Because the various requirements about which appellant complained on appeal were not applied to him, any potential ex post facto effects of those provisions on him were too speculative and attenuated to implicate Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. Moreover, former Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 62.12 required appellant to register for the remainder of his life. The 1999 and 2005 amendments were not properly classified as punitive, even though the failure to register resulted in a criminal penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The technology and student services fees were changed from flat fees to per-semester-hour fees. The trial court held that the fee was not authorized by law and that the district was required by Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 54.503(f) to obtain student approval for the increase in the student services fee. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals, and found that although Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 130.123(c) specifically authorizes junior colleges to set technology fees and in the language of this section allows junior colleges to pledge the fees to the payment of revenue bonds, it does not restrict the District from charging additional technology fees that are not pledged to revenue bonds. The court also held that the student services fees were voluntarily paid because a waiver was available and no student sought a waiver. Payment of the increased fee was not mandatory; it was contingent on enrollment in a junior college in the district. The class did not establish duress as a matter of law. Therefore, the class was not entitled to a refund of the technology fees or a refund of the increase in the student services fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the employee's Anti-Retaliation Law suit for want of jurisdiction, finding that the employer, a state university, had sovereign immunity from suit and liability. On the employee's appeal from that decision, the employee claimed that the waiver of sovereign immunity for certain state employees but not for others violated federal and state equal protection rights. The court first determined that the employee had preserved the issue for review under Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a) by raising the equal protection claim in response to the motion to dismiss. However, the court rejected the employee's claim that the Texas Workers' Compensation Act, under which sovereign immunity was not waived for certain governmental employees, violated Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Immunity was not waived for employes of state institutions that were self-insured for purposes of workers' compensation claims. The court held that the distinction between insured and self-insuring entitles could constitute a valid rational basis for the different treatment regarding sovereign immunity, because insured entities had limited exposure to suits that self-insuring entities lacked.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the District Court of Travis County, 167th Judicial District, Texas, which convicted him of third-degree felony driving while intoxicated (DWI), as enhanced by prior convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's vehicle was stopped for erratic driving, and he was charged with DWI. He was later charged by re-indictment with enhanced third-degree felony DWI based upon three prior convictions, two of which occurred in the 1980s. Defendant appealed after he was convicted and the enhancement allegation was found to be true. In affirming, the appellate court noted that former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701/-1 (repealed by 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 3586, 3704) contained a time limitation for the use of prior convictions, while Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 49.09 (2005) did not. The new version of the DWI enhancement law took effect shortly before defendant's conduct in this case. The appellate court rejected defendant's assertion that the 2005 version of the DWI enhancement statute was an ex post facto law under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 as applied to him. A legal sufficiency argument was also rejected because former Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 49.09(e) (repealed by 2005 Tex. Gen. Laws 3363, 3364) did not define an element of the offense. The new version of the law applied since all elements were committed after its enactment date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee wife sought a &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce in the 311th District Court, Harris County, Texas, and appellant husband sought a preliminary injunction to restrain the enforcement of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 6.001 (Vernon 1998). The trial court denied the husband's request, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband's plea to the jurisdiction and declaratory judgment petition argued Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 6.001 (Vernon 1998) involved the trial court in a religious determination of the &quot;legitimate ends of marriage&quot; or the reasonable expectation of &quot;reconciliation.&quot; The trial court was only asked to decide if the marriage was intolerable to the other party and of no benefit to society. The legislature could rationally accommodate the termination of a marital relationship without regard to the fault of either partner. This violated neither the Free Exercise or Establishment Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. I nor the &quot;rights of conscience&quot; guarantee of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. Marriage was not an institution protected by the &quot;free institutions&quot; provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The &quot;open courts&quot; provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, referred to common law causes of action, and not to statutory suits for divorce. The husband's arguments that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6.502(3), 6.502(7), violated privacy protections of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, were not ripe. The trial court's interlocutory order awarding the wife attorney fees was not appealable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellate court held that U.S. Const. amend.

The patient submitted evidence that she did not know of the sponge and could not have discovered it in the exercise of reasonable care prior to expiration of the ten-year repose period. The trial court granted summary judgment, but the court of appeals reversed, holding the statute unconstitutional under the Texas Constitution's Open Courts provision. The reviewing court held that Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

Health &amp; Safety Code ch. 841.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent repeatedly had his parole revoked for committing sexual assault and was adjudicated a sexually violent predator (SVP). The court of appeals held that the Act was punitive, not civil, and violated respondent's due process rights. In analyzing the Kennedy factors, the court held that the Act was civil and therefore due process did not require respondent be competent to stand trial. The court held that while the Act imposed affirmative restraints on respondent, that factor alone did not compel the conclusion that the Act was punitive. No finding of scienter was required to commit an individual found to be an SVP under the Act. Also the Act did not categorically apply only to convicted individuals. The court also found that Act furthered the interests of the state in that the state had authority under its police power to protect the community from the dangerous tendencies of some who were mentally ill. Further, respondent failed to demonstrate that the Act's behavioral abnormality definition was unconstitutionally vague in every application in that the absence of risk levels did not prohibits individualized treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect; 7.177(a)(5) (2000). The State appealed a judgment of the County Criminal Court No. 2 of Denton County, Texas, which granted defendant's motion to quash the information based on the premise that there was an unconstitutional delegation of authority by the legislature to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) in violation of Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted starting a fire containing crossties, fiberglass, tires, and PVC pipe. The court held that for purposes of the nondelegation doctrine, TCEQ was a public entity. Among other things, TCEQ was subject to the Texas Sunset Act, each of its members was an officer of the State, and the water code did not waive its sovereign immunity from suit. Hence, the heightened scrutiny applied to a private delegation was inapplicable. The nature of the subject of the legislation could not have been practically and efficiently exercised by the legislature because it was neither practical nor efficient for the legislature, which met every other year for a few months, to determine exactly what materials should be banned from outdoor burning, and under what circumstances, including the wind speed, time of day, and other minutiae related to curbing the legislatively-defined &quot;air pollution.&quot; The limitations and guidelines of Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 382.018 (Supp. 2007) established there was no merit to defendant's claim that the delegation did not contain sufficient guidance concerning what conduct might be prohibited (and made a criminal offense) under the power delegated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was reversed and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wrecker association applied for a permanent injunction to restrain the appellee sheriff department from enforcing wrecker rules. A hearing for a permanent injunction was held by 268th District Court (Texas). The trial court permanently enjoined the appellee from enforcing the provision of the wrecker rules that a price cap. All other relief was denied. Appellant challenged the trial court's decision. Appellee cross appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee sheriff department maintained a list of wrecker and towing companies. Appellee used this list to determine which towing company would be assigned to tow cars when appellee requested a non-consensual tow. Appellee enacted numerous rules and regulations specifying the requirements that wrecker truck companies had to meet in order to stay on appellee's list. Among those rules was a price cap of $ 75. The legitimacy of the rules was the subject of this appeal. The appellate court did not find the appellee's wrecker policy to be an ordinance violating the separation of powers doctrine. By definition, a departmental policy designed to refer business to a particular set of tow companies was not a law, regulation, or a provision having the force and effect of law. Appellee was allowed to create a wrecker rotation list and maintain policies in accordance with the list. The record revealed the trial judge granted a permanent injunction as to appellee's price caps because he was concerned the appellee was not in compliance with a Texas Attorney General Opinion. The opinion was not applicable to the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's grant of the permanent injunction as to the appellee's price caps was not supported by probative evidence and constituted an abuse of discretion. In all other respects, the order of the trial court was affirmed. Appellee's wrecker policy did not constitute an ordinance, law or regulation. Appellee could create a wrecker rotation list.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party was working in a plant alongside the subcontractor's employees. After an accident, the injured party sued the subcontractor and its employees. The trial court rendered a take-nothing summary judgment in favor of the subcontractor and its two employees. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that recovery of workers' compensation benefits was an exclusive remedy under Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 408.001(a) (2006). The immunity of a general contractor extended to subcontractors where the general contractor had purchased workers' compensation insurance that covered all of the workers on the site, pursuant to Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 406.123(a). Under its contract with the subcontractor, the general contractor agreed to provide workers' compensation insurance to the subcontractor, thereby creating the legal fiction of the general contractor as the &quot;deemed employer&quot; and the subcontractor and its employees as &quot;deemed employees.&quot; Next, Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 406.123, 408.001 were not unconstitutional under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13.

A mediation agreement resolved all issues relating to the appraised values, but the parties agreed to submit the issue of attorney's fees to the trial court for determination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that the upper and lower ceilings on recoverable attorney's fees in Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.29 (2008) was a violation of substantive due process. The court rejected this premise. The protected property right could not be the right to recover attorney's fees, because fees were recoverable only under a contract or by statute. Rather, the taxpayer argued that the cap deprived taxpayers of a due process right to obtain legal representation. However, the taxpayer failed to show that a taxpayer could not obtain counsel and failed to prove that the challenged governmental action was not rationally related to furthering a legitimate state interest. With regard to the law's alleged interference with the constitutional right of access to the courts, the taxpayer made no showing that such was the case. Moreover, civil litigants were not required to be represented by counsel and thousands of cases each year were prosecuted by pro se litigants. Although the court rejected the taxpayer's claim, it held that his appeal was not objectively frivolous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged by information and complaint with the offense of indecent exposure. He challenged the constitutionality of the statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 21.08, prohibiting indecent exposure as unconstitutionally vague through a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court denied appellant's application. On appeal, the appellant argued that because the Texas Penal Code did not define the terms &quot;offended&quot; or &quot;alarmed,&quot; &sect; 21.08 was unconstitutionally vague. Judgment was affirmed. The court concluded that a statute was not rendered unconstitutionally vague merely because all words or terms were not specifically defined. It found the terms &quot;offended&quot; and &quot;alarmed&quot; were words with meanings well known by people of ordinary intelligence. Finding that exposing one's anus or genitals with the intent to arouse or gratify one's sexual desire was, by its very nature, often calculated to alarm or offend, the court held that &sect; 21.08 gave fair notice of the prohibition against the proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed; the applicable penal statute prohibiting indecent public exposure was not unconstitutionally vague, as the statute gave people of ordinary intelligence fair notice that such conduct was forbidden, regardless of its lack of definitions for the terms &quot;alarmed&quot; or &quot;offended.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The power control district refused to seat directors from the irrigation districts on the board of directors due to a conversion from a water improvement district. The power control district filed a declaratory judgment action to settle the dispute. After the trial court entered judgment in favor of the power control district, the irrigation districts and a water improvement district sought review. In reversing, the court determined that a restrictive approach to former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7807d and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7807dd (now codified in Tex. Water Code Ann. ch. 51) was inconsistent with the Texas Legislature's intent regarding the conversion of one type of water district to another. The Legislature did not intend to restrict membership in water power control districts to water improvement districts; rather, it intended only to exclude the more powerful water control and improvement districts. Moreover, there was no meaningful difference in powers after the conversion to irrigation districts took place under Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 58.122, 58.042. The court rejected the argument that membership was not allowed due to different election procedures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured individual challenged a decision of the 236th District Court of Tarrant County (Texas), which granted summary judgment to appellee companies in connection with the individual's products liability action alleging strict liability, breach of express and implied warranty, and negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While working near an opening of a large, commercial mixer/blender, the individual claimed that his right hand got caught in the equipment, which resulted in a partial amputation. He filed this products liability action, but the trial court granted the companies summary judgment. The court affirmed on appeal. By using the ordinary meaning of the phrase &quot;tangible personal property&quot; provided by the legislature and the state supreme court, the textured vegetable protein manufactured and processed by the mixer/blender clearly fell within the meaning of the term, and thus the mixer/blender was the type of manufacturing equipment governed by the statute of repose in Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.012 and no genuine issue of fact existed on this issue. The statute of repose barred the individual's lawsuit under &sect; 16.012 because it was conclusively shown that the mixer/blender was sold more than 15 years before the date the individual filed the action. The court rejected the individual's attack on the constitutionality of the statute. It was reasonably related to the legitimate state purpose of protecting manufacturers and sellers from stale claims based on manufacturing equipment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Texas trial court found that some of the decedents' assets were held jointly with survivorship rights and others were community property. The Court of Appeals for the Fourteenth District of Texas affirmed in part, reversed and rendered in part, and remanded for further proceedings. Respondent, executor of the wife's estate, and petitioner, son of the husband's estate, petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that a &quot;joint tenancy&quot; or &quot;JT TEN&quot; designation on an account was sufficient to create rights of survivorship in community property under Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 452. Two of the decedents' accounts included this designation, which was sufficient to indicate their intent to hold those accounts with rights of survivorship. As to another account, the designation &quot;Joint (WROS)&quot; meant joint tenancy with rights of survivorship. This indicated the decedents' intent to obtain rights of survivorship in this account. Because the agreements' survivorship language conferred survivorship rights in the securities certificates until the decedents' deposed of them, the certificates passed to the husband pursuant to those rights. By enacting Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 46(b) at the same time as sections 451 through 462 (Chapter XI, Part 3 of the Probate Code), the Legislature provided that Part 3 was the exclusive means to establish rights of survivorship in community property. The certificates issues from certain accounts retained survivorship rights established by those accounts' agreements. The agreement to another account established rights of survivorship in the account.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of child capital murder, Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 19.03(a)(8). Pursuant to the jury's answers, the trial judge sentenced the appellant to death. Under the automatic direct appeal provisions of the death penalty statute,&nbsp;Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 37.071, &sect; 2(h), the court affirmed, holding that the child capital-murder provision was rationally related to the government's interest in protecting young children, and thus, did not violate Equal Protection Clauses of either the U.S. Const. amend. XIV or the Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Further, designating the victim's status as a young child was an aggravating element that did not require proof of an offender's specific intent as to an appellant's knowledge of the child's age, only proof that the child was under six.

On appeal, the court affirmed. Appellant argued that the municipal judge was the injured party in her cases and should have been disqualified.

Gov't Code Ann.  &sect;30.00910 (repealed; recodified at Tex. Gov't Code Ann.  &sect; 30.00027(b) (Supp. 2000)) (Act), were not so complex as to deprive her of due process. The Act was not a local or special law prohibited by Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 56, because the authority to pass a statute establishing courts in a particular city was given under Tex. Const. art.

He appealed, arguing that &sect; 21.08 was unconstitutionally vague because it did not define the term &quot;offended&quot; and &quot;alarmed.&quot; The court affirmed the denial of appellant's application for writ of habeas corpus, holding that the words &quot;offended&quot; and &quot;alarmed&quot; were terms with meanings that were well-known by people of ordinary intelligence. The court reasoned that while an actor may be unaware that some acts may alarm or offend another person, exposing one's anus or genitals with the intent to arouse or gratify a person's sexual desire is not the type of conduct that leaves an actor unaware that such conduct might be alarming or offensive.</SPAN></P>

Upon original submission, the court held that defendant was harmed because the jury was not allowed to consider the lesser included offense. The Court of Criminal Appeals (Texas) reversed and remanded the cause for consideration of defendant's remaining three points of error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the jury retired to deliberate, it sent a note to the trial court, asking whether defendant would get credit for time served and, if so, how long had he been in jail. The trial court answered that defendant would get credit for the time he had been in jail and advised the jury to recall the evidence on the length of time he had been in jail. The court held that the additional instruction was proper because it did not pertain to factual matters and was a correct statement of law under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.03, &sect; 2(a) (Supp. 2004-2005). Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11(a) specifically authorized the enactment of legislation permitting courts to inform juries about the effect of good conduct time and eligibility for parole on the period of incarceration served by the defendant. In addition, there was no infringement by the trial court on the clemency powers of the executive. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that a juror could not perform her duties as a juror, dismissing her on the second day of trial, and proceeding with only 11 jurors where the juror had a sick child with no one to help take care of him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Texas Attorney General proposed a redistricting plan as the base plan for federal redistricting. The trial court refused to accept the plan, used a state legislative council for expert assistance in developing a plan, and required the council to keep the communications between the trial court and the council confidential. The trial court accepted for review comments and suggestions from the parties. The trial court then modified its plan, based on a recommendation of another party, and ordered its plan into enactment without giving the parties the opportunity to review or comment on the plan. On appeal, the supreme court found the attorney general, under the separation-of-powers doctrine, did not have the authority to require the trial court to adopt his redistricting plan and render judgment that his plan was the baseline state court plan for the redistricting proceedings. Additionally, the trial court violated the parties' due process rights when it rendered a judgment based on the new plans not in evidence at trial without giving the parties an opportunity for a meaningful hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of a judgment from the Third Judicial District Court of Henderson County (Texas), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, the father of a deceased child and two of the father's friends, in the mother's action alleging wrongful death, survival, negligence, and gross negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and two of his friends took the child swimming at a lake, and the child drowned. The court held that the father was entitled to summary judgment under the parental immunity doctrine. Although the mother presented evidence that the father was intoxicated and that he did not supervise the child adequately, such actions did not amount to abandonment and abdication of parental responsibility. The mother's failure to make citations to the record regarding an allegation of malice waived that issue under Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h). The trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the friends on the ground that they had no duty of supervision because their pleadings failed to rebut other alleged duties; however, the error did not require reversal. There was no evidence that the friends committed a wrongful act within the meaning of Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 71.002, 71.021 or acted with gross negligence under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 41.001(11); a reasonable person would not foresee that a child would drown while his father, who had a duty of care with regard to that child under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 14.001(a)(2) (Supp. 2006), was present.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a father and a mother, challenged a decision of the 216th Judicial District Court, Bandera County (Texas), which, on a petition filed by appellee Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, terminated their parental rights to their child under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 161.001(1)(D), (E) (Supp. 2010) and found that their statement of points under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.405(b) (2008) was frivolous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and mother raised certain issues, but the court affirmed. The statements of appellate points filed by a father and mother contained specific challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and were sufficient to preserve the issues for review. Given that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 263.405(i) (2008) did not preclude the father or mother from raising their sufficiency of the evidence issues, their challenges based on due process and equal protection failed. The mother and father did not allege there were any meritorious issues they were precluded from raising on appeal because of the application of &sect; 263.405(i). Thus, they failed to show that the statute was unconstitutionally applied to them. They claimed that a competent appellate attorney could only determine whether there were arguable points after a careful review of the record, but the court previously held this argument insufficient to show facial unconstitutionality of &sect; 263.405(i). The mother and father did not argue why the record made at the hearing on a motion for a new trial would be insufficient, and the court declined to order a full record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the 297th District Court of Tarrant County (Texas ) of two counts of aggravated assault on a public servant with a deadly weapon. The trial court denied defendant's motion to reinstate bond pending appeal. The trial court then denied defendant's application for writ of habeas corpus. Defendant appealed the denial of his post-conviction application for writ of habeas corpus seeking bond pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's convictions, a surety posted bond pending appeal for defendant. When defendant was arrested on another crime to be held without bond, the trial court denied bond pending appeal to defendant. The defendant argued the trial court erred by retroactively applying Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.  art. 44.04(b), as amended effective September 1, 1999, to his cases already on appeal at the time and by failing to reinstate his bonds. The appellate court found the trial court did not err in its decision. Application of art. 44.04(b), as amended, was not prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause of the constitution. Further, defendant was not constitutionally guaranteed the right to bail pending appeal. Therefore, amended art. 44.04(b) did not violate the prohibition against retroactive laws under the Texas Constitution. Moreover, amended art. 44.04(b) was applied only after the effective date of the amendment. Finally, under either version of art. 44.04, the trial court could deny bail pending appeal if it appeared likely that the defendant would commit another offense while on bail.</SPAN></P>

The department argued that Tex. Hum. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 42 applied. The foster parents argued Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 261 applied. The appeals court held that because they operated a foster home within the meaning of Tex. Hum. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 261.309(e), the foster parents did not have the right to file suit in the district court without submitting to a formal administrative hearing. They were required to submit to an administrative hearing regardless of whether the Human Resources Code or the Family Code applied. Because the foster mother had not exhausted her administrative remedies, the district court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over her due-process claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants said it was an abuse of discretion to dismiss their suit.

Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 74.351(r)(6) (2011), because a trial court could find the expert (1) recognized an exception to criticisms of a doctor's treatment, (2) did not state when the exception applied, (3) did not state if the patient presented such a situation, and (4) begged the question as to whether the doctor's precautions met the standard of care. A supplemental report did not cure the deficiencies because it did not address deficiencies as to the standard of care and breach. Appellants did not show the expert-report requirement was unconstitutional because they did not show (1) lack of a rational basis for distinguishing between health care liability claimants and other litigants, (2) it interfered with the judiciary by barring their suit, as opposed to the lack of an adequate report, (3) it arbitrarily violated Tex.

The law did not provide appellate review from a decision to adjudicate guilt in a deferred adjudication proceeding, and because the right to appeal was not a constitutional right, not providing such right in deferred adjudication proceeding was not unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a judgment of the County Court at Law, McLennan County, Texas, dismissing the information charging defendant with the offense of keeping a gambling place on grounds that the controlling statutes,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 47.01(4) (Supp. 2001) and Tex. Penal Code &sect; 47.04 (1994), were unconstitutionally vague to give him notice of the prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The information alleged that defendant used a building as a gambling place, namely, a place used for playing eight-liners and slot machines, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 47.04(a) (1994). At a pretrial hearing, defendant argued that because the information charged that his &quot;gambling place&quot; was &quot;a place used for playing eight-liners and slot machines,&quot; the State necessarily had to prove that eight-liners and slot machines were gambling devices. However, according to defendant, Tex. Penal Code 47.01(4)(B) (Supp. 2001), which defined a gambling device, was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. The trial court agreed. The State appealed. Following the reasoning of a recent case of the Texas Third Court of Appeals, the appellate court held that the trial court erred when it found &sect; 47.01(4)(B) to be unconstitutionally vague as applied to the prosecution of eight-liners. It reversed the order dismissing the information and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order dismissing the information was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. The portion of the Texas Penal Code defining &quot;gambling device&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague as it applied to the prosecution of eight-liners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of shooting his former girlfriend. The jury in defendant's first trial imposed a life sentence. The sentence was reversed on appeal, because the trial court failed to give the mandatory instruction required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (Vernon Supp. 2002) and gave an incomplete response to the jury's question as to the length of time defendant would actually have to serve before being eligible for release. Defendant argued that the trial court erred at resentencing by giving a version of the instruction that varied from the language of the statute and that giving the instruction deprived defendant of due process. The appellate court held that the differences in the charge given were insignificant and did not harm defendant. Defendant's due process contention that it was error to give the charge when defendant was not eligible for good time credit had previously been rejected by the court. The instruction, as given, substantially complied with the requirements of the statute. Further, defendant's argument to the jury invited any error that may have occurred.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the supreme court affirmed. The Texas Workers' Compensation Act did not expressly prohibit the elections petitioners signed, and therefore they were enforceable. Absent clear legislative intent to prohibit such agreements, the court held that the agreements between petitioners and respondents were not void on public policy grounds, and that any public policy concerns should be addressed by the state legislature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim testified that he was walking his dog in the vicinity of a gay bar one evening, when appellant called him a &quot;pervert&quot; and a &quot;homosexual&quot;, before attacking him with a knife. Appellant was charged with aggravated assault, under an indictment which included a hate crimes enhancement paragraph. The jury found him guilty of the lesser-included offense of assault. At the punishment phase, appellant urged a motion to quash the indictment on grounds that the Texas Hate Crimes Statute was void for vagueness in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The trial court denied the motion and entered a finding that appellant selected the victim primarily because of appellant's bias and prejudice against homosexuals. The appellate court interpreted appellant's brief as conceding that the statute as applied to him involved a legitimate and specific bias group, homosexuals. By failing to first establish that Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators argued that the franchise tax, Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 171.001, violated Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 24. The court held that the tax did not facially violate the constitution, and the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the as applied challenge and the fee award issue. The court held that Act of May 2, 2006, 79th Leg., 3d C.S., ch. 1, &sect; 24, 2006 Tex. Gen. Laws 1, 1-41, served as a specific, limited exception to the generalized provisions of the Tax Code that conferred exclusive jurisdiction over certain suits on the district courts of Travis County, like relators' suit in this case. The court had jurisdiction under Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 3(a) and case law did not stand as impediments to that jurisdiction. Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 24 did not preclude the taxation of business entities for the privilege of doing business in Texas and taking advantage of the option to limit the liability of business owners via a limited partnership structure. The franchise tax did not constitute a tax on the net income of relators' natural-person limited partners within the meaning of the Article VIII, &sect; 24, and relators' facial challenge lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 42.014 and former Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.47, which increased defendant's sentence because the victim was selected because of defendant's bias or prejudice against a group, were facially unconstitutional under both the United States and Texas Constitutions. The appellate court found that defendant failed to demonstrate that former Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.014 and former Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.47 could never be applied in a constitutional fashion. Thus, defendant failed to meet his burden with regard to the facial challenge that the statutes were unconstitutional and the appellate court overruled his sole issue on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee filed a workers' compensation claim after suffering a work-related injury. The 288th Judicial District Court, Bexar County, Texas, granted summary judgment in favor of appellee employer. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged the constitutionality of the exclusive remedy provision of the Texas Workers' Compensation Act, specifically, Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 406.123 and 406.144, claiming that those provisions violated the open courts guarantee of the Texas Constitution. The appeals court disagreed. The employee argued that these provisions violated the open courts guarantee because they permitted a general contractor, such as the employer, to benefit from workers' compensation coverage while passing the costs of that coverage down to a laborer, such as the employee. This stance entirely missed the point of the law. As an employee, he benefitted from a limited, but guaranteed right to workers' compensation benefits, and this benefit served as an adequate substitute to his common law claim, wherein recovery was conditioned upon his ability to prove his employer's negligence. So long as there was a compensation policy in force, the manner in which the insurance was paid was immaterial.</SPAN></P>
