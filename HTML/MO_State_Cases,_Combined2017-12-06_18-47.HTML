I, &sect; 14 because it did not bar access to the courts; [4]-Section 538.300 did not infringe on the right to a trial by jury under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 22(a) because it did not curtail the jury's determination of damages; [5]-No reversible error was shown as to the questioning of an expert, voir dire, testimony that mentioned religion, or closing argument; [6]-The verdict was not excessive, and denying remittitur thus was not error.</SPAN></P>

V, &sect;&sect; 14, 23, 27(2)(d) did not depend on the validity of an ordinance, the city's dismissal of traffic cases meant that the municipal proceedings did not provide an adequate legal remedy to challenge the validity of the city's red light camera ordinance and thus did not preclude maintaining a declaratory judgment action as a pre-enforcement challenge; [2]-The challenged ordinance was unconstitutional because it created a mandatory rebuttable presumption that shifted the burden of persuasion onto the defendant to show that he or she was not operating the vehicle at the time of the violation; [3]-Filing a separate action while the municipal proceedings were pending was not necessary and the city did not engage in intentional misconduct, so a motion for attorney's fees was properly overruled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-Prisoner was not entitled to habeas corpus relief because he failed to make the threshold showing to justify staying his execution so that his competence under the Eighth Amendment could be determined, and there was no evidence that he was not capable of understanding matters for extenuation or clemency under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 552.060.1 (2000); [2]-Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 552.060.2 (2000) is not unconstitutional because it does not permit the director of the Missouri Department of Correction to determine whether an inmate is competent to be executed to the exclusion of (or even as a predicate to) the inmate's ability to seek a judicial determination on that issue; [3]-Prisoner was not intellectually disabled and, therefore, categorically ineligible for the death penalty because under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.030.6 (Supp. 2013) he was of average intelligence -- or better -- before age 18.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 104.140.3 (Supp. 2002) discriminated solely on the basis of marital status, not sexual orientation; [2]-The partner did not have standing under Mo. Rev.

I, &sect; 13 as applied to defendant who had a prior felony conviction from 2001; [2]-The Supreme Court of Missouri held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.070 was not an ex post facto law as applied to defendant, because it did not apply to conduct completed before its enactment in 2008, nor did it punish his past conduct or increase the punishment for his past offense; [3]-Defendant did not complete the crime defined in &sect; 571.070 until he possessed a revolver in 2011; [4]-By considering his convicted felon status an element of the crime, &sect; 571.070 merely drew upon the antecedent fact of defendant's prior conviction in imposing punishment for new conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff condominium association filed a petition to foreclose a lien against defendant owners and their lender in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri. The owners defaulted. The lender objected that its lien had priority; however, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the association, finding that the lender's lien was inferior and subordinate to the association's lien. The lender appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners refinanced their unit; the lender's lien was recorded prior to the association's lien. However, under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 448.3-116.2(4), the association was granted super-priority status with regard to an assessment lien because the assessments against individual unit owners ensured that the common elements were maintained. The lender challenged the constitutionality of the statute, arguing that the language of the section prioritizing the relationship between a refinancing deed of trust and a lien for delinquent assessment of condominium fees was vague and unconstitutional because it could not be understood by a person of ordinary intelligence. The court held that the clear language of &sect; 448.3-116.2(4) provided an exception to super-priority in a situation when there was a pending assessment lien at the time the unit owner refinanced. In this case, at the time the owners refinanced their unit, there was no pending assessment lien. The lender did not fall within this subsection, did not meet any of the statutory exceptions of &sect; 448.3-116.2, and was not entitled to priority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2003, the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, Missouri, dissolved the marriage of appellant father and appellee mother. The father later filed motions to reduce his child support and to terminate maintenance. The trial court reduced child support but made no change to the maintenance. While the father's appeal was pending, the trial court ordered the father to pay $ 7,500 of the mother's attorney fees on appeal. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the circuit court's award of attorney fees on appeal did not constitute an amendment of the dissolution judgment or the entry of a new dissolution judgment. The award of attorney fees related solely to the collateral matter of the mother's right to pursue a statutorily authorized award of attorney fees on appeal pursuant to &sect; 452.355. The statute provided sufficient guidance so as to allow a person of ordinary intelligence to understand the standards to be applied by the circuit court in making an award of attorney fees. Section 452.355 clearly provided that the circuit court was to consider all relevant factors, including financial resources, the merits of the case, and the conduct of the parties. The &quot;conduct of the parties&quot; was not defined, but given the context, conduct that would cause the other party to incur more attorney fees is a valid consideration. The fact that the father was an attorney representing himself, combined with his greater financial resources, supported the trial court's award of attorney fees to the mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the award of attorney fees for the mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was arrested for driving while intoxicated. The driver's license was suspended and since the driver's suspension of his license was an alcohol-related enforcement contact, he was disqualified from driving a commercial motor vehicle.

Caselaw did not support a finding that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.700 violated the United States Constitution. The driver argued that state law should be stricken as violative of the Spending Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 1.

Defendant told the officer that because the officer let his brother die, he was going to die. Defendant argued that his counsel was ineffective for failing to produce evidence regarding his acute stress disorder (ASD), which would have demonstrated that defendant was not capable of deliberation. Both of his trial counsel testified that they decided as a matter of trial strategy not to pursue a diminished capacity defense, in part because the State had substantial evidence of deliberation. Additionally, counsel presented and argued evidence demonstrating his emotional state at the time of the murder. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a video of a demonstration of the encounter using two police officers because it was a fair representation of the evidence presented by the State, although the officers in the video were not the same heights as defendant and the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.083 (Supp. 2010) was overbroad. The supreme court held he did not show this because (1) he did not show it might chill speech, since it barred conduct, and, (2) on the facts, he conceded his conduct was not expressive. His overbreadth claim based on the right to privacy failed because overbreadth only applied in the First Amendment context. He did not show his right to privacy was violated by punishing innocent nudity because (1) he eliminated such right by standing nude in full view of a street, and (2) the statute required knowing exposure, under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 562.016(3)(1) (Supp. 2010). Sufficient evidence supported the exposure convictions because (1) appearing nude multiple times created an inference of knowledge, (2) it could be inferred that he waited for his victims to walk by his house, (3) he had no reason to think the victims could not see him, and (4) a jury could infer his conduct would cause affront or alarm. Sufficient evidence supported the attempt convictions because this was only charged when his victims did not see him, so he took a substantial step toward committing the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held Mo. Rev.

X, &sect;&sect; 16 to 21 (the Hancock Amendment), barring state imposition of unfunded mandates on local government. The supreme court disagreed because (1) the education mandate was not &quot;new,&quot; (2) the statute did not &quot;increase&quot; that mandate since the level of services did not increase, and (3) the Hancock Amendment did not bar local-to-local shifting of existing services as it intended to prevent burden-shifting from the state to a local entity. While statutory transportation mandates were &quot;new,&quot; they were not shown to be unfunded because compliance costs evidence was speculative. &quot;Impossibility&quot; was not a defense to enforcing the statute because the case was narrowed to the parent's two children. The taxpayers properly intervened, under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 52.12, because (1) taxpayers had to bring Hancock challenges, and (2) their claims were in common with the main action.

While &sect; 568.040 (Supp. 2011) created an overlapping option for a defendant to put on an affirmative defense of good cause for failure to provide adequate support under a preponderance of the evidence standard, that provision did not negate the express requirement making lack of good cause an element that the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. In the current case, there was sufficient evidence that defendant's failure to pay ordered child support was without good cause. It was uncontested that defendant provided absolutely no monetary support and there was evidence that he was self-employed as a tile setter, was physically and mentally able to work, and had rental property income of an unspecified amount. The State did not have to show that defendant was able to pay the full amount required by the administrative order. There was also testimony that defendant said he would not pay because he did not like being ordered to do so and would fight the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer alleged that the circuit court abused its discretion in sustaining the employee's motion for additur or, in the alternative, a new trial and that the circuit court abused its discretion in ordering a new trial limited to the issue of damages only. However, the supreme court affirmed, stating that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the motion. The circuit court weighed the evidence pursuant to its discretionary authority established by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.068 (2000) and in accord with Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 78.01 and 78.02 when it ruled on the motion for additur or, in the alternative, a new trial. Because the employer did not demonstrate that the issues of liability and compensatory damages were substantially intertwined, or demonstrate how it would be prejudiced by the circuit court's order, it could not be said that the circuit court abused its discretion in ordering a new trial on the issue of compensatory damages only.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate argued that the trial court erred in overruling his motions to dismiss and for directed verdict and in entering judgment in favor of the police chief because the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The supreme court noted that it appeared that the candidate's complaint was with the chief's &quot;capacity&quot; to bring the action against him. The supreme court found that the Community Fire Board of Directors (Community Fire) specifically authorized the chief to pursue any legal action necessary to remove the candidate's name from the April 2 ballot. The chief, as an official with Community Fire, authorized on its behalf, possessed the legal capacity to maintain the action against the candidate on behalf of Community Fire. Community Fire was sufficiently affected by the candidate's failure to timely file his financial interest statement and possessed the requisite standing to bring the action. Adequate notice to the candidate was provided. The candidate did not demonstrate that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 105.487 and 105.492&nbsp;unconstitutionally burdened his ballot access. He was not denied equal protection of the laws. His due process claim was without merit.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 534.200, 534.210 (Supp. 2012) which prohibited a defendant raising equitable defenses and/or challenges to the validity of the plaintiff's title in an unlawful detainer action were not unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the only purpose of Section B was to condition the effectiveness of Section A upon the passage and signing of SB 8. The 82 new sections proposed by SB 8 related mainly to the provision of tax credits. Conditioning the effectiveness of the science and innovation provisions of SB 7 on the enactment of the taxation provisions in SB 8 clearly injected at least one additional subject into SB 7. SB 7 clearly contained at least two subjects. Merely putting the contingency in the title of SB 7 was not sufficient to make the public or legislature aware of the subject matter of the extensive taxation legislation upon which SB 7 was contingent. The single subject rule would become meaningless if the legislature were able to condition the effectiveness of one bill upon passage of another bill covering a different subject matter. Severance was not justified under the facts, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1.140 (Supp. 2011), where the contingency clause in section B was part of the bill's very subject.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, entered a declaratory judgment finding that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 443.713(2)(a) (Cum. Supp. 2011) was unconstitutional as applied to respondent mortgage loan originator as it violated Mo. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The originator argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 443.713(2)(a) violated the state and federal constitutional bans on bills of attainder, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10; Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 30. The supreme court noted that the statute did not inflict punishment. It did not reflect a punitive purpose. There was nothing in the legislative record that disclosed any intent to punish. The statute was a valid business and economic regulation as opposed to an invalid bill of attainder. Under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, the originator did not have a vested right to a mortgage loan originator license. Section 443.713(2)(a) did not independently require anything of the originator and, therefore, imposed no new obligation or duty on him based on his prior guilty plea. The statute did not require the originator to undertake any action and the regulatory obligation was on the director. Section 443.713(2)(a) did not violate Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The enactment of the statute did not deprive the originator of any property interest without due process. The statute did not violate the originator's right to substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with one count of harassment under Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sent a number of emails to various public officials. The alderwoman received an email from defendant with an audio attachment in which he made reference to a sawed-off shotgun, murders and assassinations, and called himself a terrorist. The trial court did not err by overruling his motion to dismiss the harassment charge under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.090.1(2). Defendant's communications inflicted injury or tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace, and therefore were not protected by the First Amendment or Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Because &sect; 565.090.1(2) punished defendant for his unprotected communications, it was not unconstitutional as applied. The evidence was sufficient to support his conviction, because a juror could reasonably find that the alderwoman was placed in reasonable apprehension of offensive physical contact or harm. Defendant's conviction for a violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.090.1(5) was reversed, because &sect; 565.090.1(5) was unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>

There was no dispute that appellant timely raised the issues. However, a guilty plea waived all nonjurisdictional defects, including statutory and constitutional guarantees. Appellant did not provide the supreme court with a transcript of his plea hearing or otherwise demonstrate that his guilty pleas were made conditional upon the preservation of his constitutional challenges. Appellant's guilty pleas in open court were presumed, without the transcript of the plea hearing included in the record, to have been made knowingly and voluntarily in accordance with Mo. Sup. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Missouri held that Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 29 imposes on employers an affirmative duty to bargain collectively and overruled Quinn v. Buchanan, 298 S.W.2d 413 (Mo. banc 1957). Therefore, each of the cities in the current case had a duty to bargain collectively with the exclusive bargaining representative elected by its police officers and sergeants, with a goal of reaching an agreement. The cities were not excused from carrying out that duty because the public employees represented by the union were not covered by the procedures codified in the public sector labor law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 105.500, et seq. Each city had the ability to establish a procedural framework for collective bargaining with its excluded employees if necessary to effectuate its duty. Nevertheless, because the cities might be able to meet their duty without establishing a framework, the trial courts erred in ordering them to do so. Furthermore, as authorized by Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 84.14, the court ordered the cities to recognize the union as the collective bargaining unit for the cities' police officers and sergeants and to begin to meet and confer with the union for collective bargaining.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Missouri held that Mo. Const. art.

Otherwise public employers could act with the intent to thwart collective bargaining so as never to reach an agreement, frustrating the very purpose of bargaining and invalidating the right. Consequently, the trial court erred in finding that the board had no duty to meet and confer with the union and, further, that it had no duty to bargain collectively in good faith. The trial court further erred in its conditional finding that the board had not bargained in good faith because that finding considered good faith only as that term was understood under federal law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs city, mayor, and a city employee brought suit against defendant State in the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), seeking to prevent the application of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 320.097 (Supp. 2010) to the city. The trial court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment in part, finding that the statute violated home rule. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of St. Louis required its firefighters to live in the city; however, the city's schools were not accredited. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 320.097 (Supp. 2010) permitted firefighters who had been employed seven years or more to live outside the district if the schools were not accredited during the past five years of their employment. The city argued that the statute was a special law in violation of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40, that it violated home rule under Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 22, and that it violated equal protection. The court rejected these arguments. Because the law was open-ended and applied to all cities with residency requirements for firefighters and unaccredited schools, it was not a special law, even thought St. Louis was the only city that met these requirements. It did not violate home rule because St. Louis maintained the right to set its employees' powers, duties, and compensation; residency requirements were not a part of an employee's powers, duties, or compensation. It did not violate equal protection principles because it was rationally related to the legitimate state purposes of improving children's education and retaining experienced firefighters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's holding that &sect; 320.097 was not a special law in violation of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40, but reversed the holding that &sect; 320.097 violated the home rule law and equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff beneficiaries sought review of a judgment entered by the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which denied their challenge to the constitutional validity of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 104.1030 (2000) in an action to recover on an annuity from defendant, the Missouri State Employees' Retirement System (MOSERS).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff government employee had filed for retirement and had assigned August 1, 2009, as her retirement date as well as her annuity starting date; the employee passed away on July 29, 2009, without a surviving spouse or dependent children. The beneficiaries sought to have MOSERS distribute the employee's retirement benefits to them as her designated beneficiaries. MOSERS denied the request based on the application of &sect; 104.1030 to the plan chosen by the employee. On appeal, the court affirmed. While &sect;&sect; 104.1030.2 and 104.1030.3 permitted payment of an annuity to an employee's surviving spouse or dependent children if the employee died before the annuity's start date, the beneficiaries did not fall into either category. No provision existed in &sect; 104.1030 allowing a designated beneficiary to be paid the annuity benefits if the employee died before retirement. Based on the plain language of the statute, the employee was not entitled to recover retirement benefits based on her contract with the State; thus, the court did not need to address the constitutional issues raised as enforcement of her contract did not involve any impairment of contract.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the immunity granted to the debtors pursuant to &sect; 513.380.2 was coextensive with their constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the prosecutor did not give the debtors immunity under any of the statues, nor was this a criminal prosecution, nor a matter concerning taxes, antitrust violations or any of the other issues as to which Missouri's statutes gave a prosecutor to grant immunity as to any matter, transaction, or thing. The grant of immunity was given so that a witness would not invoke the privilege against self-incrimination in a debtor's examination. The plain language of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 513.380 (2000) on its face solely authorized prosecutors to provide witnesses who were compelled to testify in judgment debtor's examinations with use immunity. There was no evidence that the Missouri legislature intended by its use to convert the statute's express grant of authority to provide use immunity into an implied grant of authority to provide transactional immunity. The plain language of &sect; 513.380.2 stated just what it provided --use immunity alone.

The auditor's statutory duties under &sect; 116.175 did not render the statute unconstitutional under Mo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13. The trial court correctly upheld the fairness and sufficiency of the secretary of state's summary statement and the auditor's fiscal note and summary for the proposed tax and minimum wage initiatives. In the payday loan initiative cases, the trial court erred in finding the secretary of state's initiative summary statement unfair and insufficient. It also erred in finding the auditor's fiscal note and fiscal note summary unfair and insufficient.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trash haulers brought suit against defendant county in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, alleging that the county failed to comply with the notice provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 260.247 prior to letting contracts to other haulers. The circuit court found county liable to the haulers on the theory of implied in law contract and awarded $ 1.2 million in damages. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The haulers had provided trash collection services to clients in parts of unincorporated St. Louis County. In 2007, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 260.247 was enacted, requiring two years' notice to trash haulers prior to terminating their contracts. In 2008, the county awarded contracts for trash collection services to other haulers; the county did not comply with the notice provision. The court held that the law of the case doctrine precluded the county from arguing that &sect; 260.247 did not apply to it, due to a prior appeal on that issue. The court rejected the county's contentions that S. 54 was unconstitutional under Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 23 (bill title must explain bill's contents), or Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 (retrospective laws). The court held that &sect; 260.247 provided a private right of action and that the haulers' complaint adequately informed the county of its claim for relief, although it did not specifically plead an implied in law contract. The court found that the haulers were entitled to continue providing services for two years. Therefore, the county was required to pay the haulers the amount they would have received under their contract during the two-year waiting period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's calculation of damages, affirmed the judgment in all other respects, and remanded the case to the circuit court for additional evidence and a ruling on damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother, as the next friend of her minor child, sought review of a judgment entered by the Circuit Court of Greene County (Missouri) in the mother's medical malpractice action against defendants, a medical center and its doctors. The mother claimed that the cap in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 538.210 (2000) on non-economic damages was an unconstitutional violation of her right to a trial by jury under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 22(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury awarded the mother $1.45 million in non-economic damages and $3.371 million in future medical damages; the future medical damages were reduced to present value under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 538.220, and the trial court ordered that half of the future damages be paid immediately in a lump sum with the rest being paid over a 50-year period. The court held that &sect; 538.210 violated the mother's right to a jury trial as it eliminated the jury's function to make a determination of the amount of her non-economic damages because the cap operated wholly independently of the facts of the case. Missouri common law did not provide for such legislative limits on the assessment of civil damages, and, thus, the right of trial by jury &quot;as heretofore enjoyed&quot; was violated. Based on that determination, Adams By and Through Adams v. Children's Mercy Hosp., 832 S.W.2d 898, 907 (Mo. banc 1992), was overruled to the extent that it held that the statutory cap did not violate the right to a trial by jury. A new period payment schedule had to be entered as the time period involved and the minimal interest rate imposed would result in insufficient funds to pay the child's future medical costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment to the extent that it capped non-economic damages pursuant to &sect; 538.210. The court also reversed and remanded for the entry of a new periodic payment schedule for the child's future medical expenses. Otherwise, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Minnesota), which overruled his Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate appealed the overruling of his Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15 motion for postconviction relief, but the supreme court affirmed. The motion judge's questioning was appropriate and proper and in no way indicated bias or prejudice against the inmate. Furthermore, having the same judge during the postconviction relief proceedings as the one who imposed the death sentence after the jury found a statutory aggravating circumstance did not amount to a disqualifying bias or prejudice. The inmate also failed to show that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel. Even assuming that the inmate's trial counsel were ineffective for failing to present evidence of a psychiatrist or neuropsychologist, the inmate was not prejudiced. Additionally, statements that sent a message of intolerance to the community were appropriate and counsel could not be ineffective for failing to make a nonmeritorious objection. Also, the decision by trial counsel to not conduct additional investigation regarding DNA evidence and present expert testimony at trial was a matter of reasonable trial strategy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court found that, pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 74.01(b), there was no just reason for delay with respect to the matters raised and certified its order and judgment as final with respect to the matters resolved thereby. Counts III and V sought to quiet title to the property from different parties but, ultimately, the trustee could only receive quiet title to the property by succeeding on both of those counts. Count IV was also interrelated to those in that it addressed the property as it was misrecorded on the deed of trust. Further, the trustee's additional counts requesting ejectment and a preliminary injunction both related to the tax sale and the alleged wrongful transfer of the property to the purchaser. Because Count III clearly arose out of the same set of facts, and the same transactions and occurrences as pending Counts IV and V, the circuit court's order did not resolve a single, distinct judicial unit, and, therefore, was neither a final nor appealable judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1963, the Missouri General Assembly enacted legislation which authorized the city to levy an earnings tax for general revenue purposes.

Appellants filed a declaratory judgment action, claiming Proposition A was unconstitutional. The trial court properly dismissed the petition for failure to state a claim. The Supreme Court of Missouri held that: (1) Proposition A did not violate Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 51 because there was no de facto appropriation of money to pay election costs; (2) Proposition A did not violate the Hancock Amendment, Mo. Const. art.

She believed he was under the age beyond which concealed weapons were permitted. He then went into a store.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Scott County (Missouri) invalidating Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.090.1(5) and (6) (Supp. 2008) as being unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that &sect; 565.090.1(5) was unconstitutionally overbroad because it criminalized communication protected by the First Amendment. Although the statute purported to criminalize &quot;harassment,&quot; &sect; 565.090.1(5), unlike the other subdivisions of &sect; 565.090.1, did not require the conduct to actually harass in any sense of the word. Rather, it criminalized a person who knowingly made repeated unwanted communication to another person. The court concluded that &sect; 565.090.1(5) could be severed. The court held that &sect; 565.090.1(6) was not overly broad because it limited its application to a core of unprotected expression. The prohibition against any other act done with the purpose to frighten, intimidate, or cause emotional distress punished actions that by their very occurrence inflicted injury or tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace. Such activity was unprotected by the First Amendment. &quot;Good cause&quot; in &sect; 565.090.1(6) meant a cause that would motivate a reasonable person of like age under the circumstances under which the act occurred.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Platte County (Missouri) convicting him of one felony count of first-degree promoting child pornography under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 573.025.1 (2000) and eight felony counts of first-degree possession of child pornography under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 573.037.1 (Supp. 2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for promoting child pornography because the clear inference from the text of his post on a pedophile website and its context was that he was describing physical contact with three children that, at a minimum, represented apparent acts of sexual stimulation or gratification. The post described one child's physical contact with defendant's genitals and defendant's physical contact with the genitals of one child and with the genitals and buttocks of another. The evidence was also sufficient to support one of defendant's convictions for possession of child pornography because the images depicted sexual conduct as defined in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 573.010(17) (2000). However, the trial court violated defendant's double jeopardy rights by entering eight separate convictions for possession of child pornography because the multiple convictions were based on possession of the same type of item, still images, and the 2008 amendment to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 573.037 could only be read to evidence the legislature's intent to permit only a single conviction for such conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of promoting child pornography and one of his convictions for possession of child pornography were affirmed.

III, &sect; 2 a nonpartisan reapportionment commission was appointed to file a new apportionment plan. After the plan was filed, the voters filed a declaratory judgment action. The trial court allowed an intervention in the case. The trial court entered judgment against the voters, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing intervention under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 52.12(b) because the intervenors had unique personal and economic interests at stake. The trial court did not err in its decision under the sunshine law because the commission was a judicial entity that was not acting in an administrative capacity under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 610.010. The voters failed to meet their burden of proving that the plan filed by the commission was clearly and undoubtedly unconstitutional under Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 2 or Mo. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, ruled that plaintiff residents failed to prove that the congressional redistricting map in H.B. 193 (Map) violated the requirement in Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 45 that each district be as compact as may be and entered judgments in favor of defendants, Attorney General and Secretary of State, as well as intervenor representatives.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the residents at all times had the burden of proving the Map was unconstitutional. The trial court did not erroneously declare or apply the compactness requirement in Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 45. If a district seemed not to be composed of closely united territory because of minimal and practical deviations, the district was still as compact as may be if those deviations were due to mandatory and permissive factors. The trial court's judgment, which determined that absolute precision was not required and that other factors may affect compactness, was consistent with the proper construction of the constitutional provision. The residents failed to satisfy their burden of persuasion with the trier of fact that, based on the evidence, the challenged districts clearly and undoubtedly contravened the constitution. The trial court did not err in concluding the residents failed to prove that district 3 clearly and undoubtedly contravened the constitution. The residents failed to prove that district 5 clearly and undoubtedly contravened the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, entered a judgment providing $1,265,207.64 in noneconomic damages to appellant husband for the wrongful death of his wife, in accordance with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 538.210 (2000), which placed a cap on noneconomic damages. The husband appealed; respondents, doctor and employer, cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that Missouri did not recognize a common-law claim for wrongful death. The General Assembly merely placed limits on the amount of noneconomic damages recoverable under a statutorily created cause of action. The provisions within Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 538.210 (2000) limiting noneconomic damages in wrongful death suits did not violate Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 22(a). The General Assembly could negate causes of action or their remedies that did not exist prior to 1820. The judiciary had the duty to prescribe the trial process and to protect those rights to jury trial as existed prior to 1820, Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 22(a); art. II, &sect; 1. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 538.220 (2000) did not violate the right to trial by jury, nor did it violate the principle of separation of powers. It was within the trial court's discretion to assign the entire award as past noneconomic damages. The husband made a submissible case to the jury. The husband's pleading of joint and several liability along with the existence of a settlement with named defendants raised the presumption that the settlement was for the same injury as recovered under the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in all respects except as to reduction under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.060; the judgment with respect to that section was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Platte County, Missouri, entered a judgment declaring a road to be a private road, finding that it was never legally dedicated to public use because the easement holders did not consent to the dedication. The court also found that the road was used as a private road, not a public road. Appellants, county and landowners, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the circuit court erred in failing to determine that respondent resident's claim for declaratory judgment was barred by the 10-year statute of limitations in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.010 (2000). The supreme court found that the resident's claim was not barred by the statute of limitations because appellants did not specifically assert &sect; 516.010 as an affirmative defense prior to trial and therefore waived that defense. The BP-I plat did not eliminate the easement because neither the original owner nor his successors relinquished their easements. The BP-II plat did not eliminate the easements because the plat purported only to dedicate to public use the streets and roads shown on the plat. The BP-II plat did not convert the road to a public road. There was no dedication of the road to the public pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 228.190.1 because there had been no public use of the road. The fact that the road was not used by the public meant that there was no common law dedication or prescriptive easement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, which dismissed as moot his claim that his federal procedural due process rights were violated when respondent Missouri Board of Private Investigator Examiners denied his application for a private investigator license before giving him a meaningful opportunity to be heard, and which also dismissed his free-speech claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the circuit court correctly held Missouri's private investigator licensure statute to be constitutional. The court held that &quot;private investigator business,&quot; as it appeared in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 324.1100-324.1148 (Supp. 2009), included the furnishing of, making of, or agreeing to make the investigations elaborated in &sect; 324.1100(9) only when done as part of a commercial enterprise carried on for profit or as part of a particular occupation habitually engaged in for livelihood or gain. Because none of the hypothetical unconstitutional applications suggested by the applicant were authorized by the statute when it was so construed, the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The court concluded that the applicant's procedural due process claims were properly found to be moot because the Board had been ordered by the Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission to issue the applicant a license and the Board had complied. Any assertion that the precise situation in which the applicant found himself would recur was purely speculative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent county prosecutor instituted a quo warranto action against appellant county presiding commissioner, alleging that he usurped the office of county presiding commissioner because he was not qualified to be a candidate. The Circuit Court of Cass County (Missouri) entered its judgment granting the prosecutor's petition for quo warranto and ordering the commissioner's ouster from office. The commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1995, the commissioner pleaded guilty to assault in the second degree, a class C felony, in Missouri. The circuit court suspended execution of his sentence and placed him on supervised probation for three years. He successfully completed his probation. The Missouri conviction was not recorded with the Missouri State Highway Patrol and remained absent from the commissioner's criminal history. However, the prosecutor alleged that the commissioner was not qualified to be a candidate for elective public office due to his 1995 felony conviction. While Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115.350 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2010) related to the commissioner's 1995 conviction and foreclosed his ability to qualify to run for office, its operation did not change the legal effect of his conviction. Any possible criminal consequences that the commissioner might suffer pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115.631 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2010) would not arise solely because of his 1995 conviction, but rather, would arise because the averment that if elected he would qualify for office was false. Thus, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115.350, as applied to the commissioner, did not operate retrospectively in violation of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 506.360 to 506.390, was unconstitutional. The writs were dismissed by the trial court, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the consolidated petitions for writs of habeas corpus without prejudice to re-filing. Next, there was no right to appeal the denial of the petitions. As to the declaratory judgment claims relating to the MPLRA, the inmates had abandoned claims that Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 18(a) and U.S. Const. amend. V were violated. Moreover, they did not establish that the alleged shortcomings in the library or legal assistance program hindered their efforts to pursue a legal claim. They failed to show that the MPLRA's requirement that indigent prisoner's pay a percentage of their prisoner accounts to satisfy the filing fee was arbitrary or unreasonable. The inmate's right to file petitions for habeas corpus were not affected. Finally, the practice of collecting filing fees on an installment basis was not conscious shocking and did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, held that all provisions of Senate Bill (SB) 844, except those relating to procurement, were unconstitutional because they violated the single subject limitation set forth in Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 23. Appellant State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the title and earliest content of SB 844 demonstrated that the original purpose pertained to procurement of necessary goods and services for elected officials. The final version of SB 844 contained numerous provisions that were not germane to the original purpose of the bill at the time it was introduced. The multiple provisions relating to campaign finance, ethics and keys to the capitol dome were not logically connected or germane to procurement, which was the original purpose of SB 844. Consequently, SB 844 violated the original purpose requirement of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 21. Severance was appropriate. The properly enacted provisions pertaining to procurement were complete and were capable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent. Therefore, the provisions of SB 844 relating to procurement, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 37.900 and 34.048, were severed from the remainder of the bill and left intact.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had struck them based on Mo. Rev.

The state supreme court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.675 (Supp. 2009) was not limited to amending Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 52.08 governing class actions and did not mention that rule by name, meaning the statute conflicted with Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 5. It then found that where a statute and the Missouri Constitution conflicted, it had to strike down the statute. Thus, it ruled that the trial court had exceeded its authority in striking the allegations pursuant to Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, Missouri, that convicted him of first-degree assault under Mo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant approached the victim at a bar and told him that he wanted to talk outside. They knew each other and had argued on prior occasions. After a short exchange, defendant cut the victim's throat, neck, chin, chest, knee, and abdomen with a knife. On review, the court rejected defendant's argument that the testimony at trial was inconclusive as to which party was the initial aggressor and that the State failed to prove that the victim's injuries were the result of defendant's attempt to kill or cause serious physical injury because that argument failed to recognize that the jury had the right to disregard defendant's evidence and testimony. It was the jury's job to determine witness credibility, resolve conflicts in testimony, and weigh evidence, and the jury was well within its province to reject defendant's claim of self-defense. Further, the number of the victim's wounds and their severity, combined with victim's testimony, provided sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that defendant attempted to kill or knowingly caused serious physical injury to the victim and that he knowingly did so using a dangerous instrument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the Missouri legislature's failure to hold a fiscal note hearing did not invalidate the Act because neither Mo.

The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 573.531, which required open booths and required that patrons not touch or come within six feet of the dancers, did not violate the First Amendment because the businesses' evidence failed to cast doubt on the government's rationale for believing that there were health and safety issues that could reasonably be ameliorated by the restrictions. The nudity ban of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 573.531.3 did not violate the First Amendment because the businesses did not offer any evidence casting doubt on precedent from the United States Supreme Court, United States court of appeals, and anecdotal evidence describing the health concerns related to nude dancing.</SPAN></P>

The mother's psychological evaluation stated that people with I.Q. scores like hers were usually not able to parent independently. A county juvenile officer filed a petition to terminate the mother's parental rights to son and alleged four grounds for termination pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.447 (Supp. 2010). Following a hearing, the trial court ordered that her parental rights in the son be terminated because she abused or neglected the son in and that termination was in the son's best interests. The state supreme court found that the mother's due process rights were not violated because the required Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate petitioned for a declaratory judgment seeking a declaration that the Missouri Incarceration Reimbursement Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.825 et seq. (2000) (MIRA), could not be applied to require reimbursement from him for the cost of his incarceration because the acts causing his incarceration were committed prior to the law's enactment. The trial court dismissed his petition. The state supreme court found that because the facts alleged in the petition were not developed sufficiently to give rise to a ripe controversy, he could not maintain such an action. It so concluded because it found that he had not shown that a reasonable basis existed for believing that some gifts that he anticipated or other monies that might be deposited in his inmate account would be sufficient to trigger the state's power to initiate MIRA proceedings. Under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.831.3 (2000), the state could only file such an action if an offender had sufficient assets to recover not less than 10 percent of the estimated cost of his care or 10 percent of the estimated cost of his care for two years, whichever was less, and he could not show that he had or would receive such an amount.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) convicted defendant of attempted enticement of a child and sentenced him to five years in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with and convicted of the inchoate crime of attempted enticement of a child. He admitted that he thought the person he was speaking to was a 14-year-old child, and substantial evidence was presented that he asked the child to meet with him to engage in sexual activity. That was sufficient to constitute an attempt under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 564.011 (2000). Under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.151.2 (Supp. 2010), it was no defense to a charge of attempted enticement of a child that the underlying offense of enticement of a child was legally or factually impossible because the victim was a police officer masquerading as a child. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.151 (Supp. 2010) put a person of ordinary intelligence on notice that, if he or she was at least 21 years old, attempting to entice a person younger than 15 years old for the purpose of engaging in sexual conduct - regardless of whether the victim was, in fact, younger than 15 years - was a crime. Thus, defendant's challenge that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.151 (Supp. 2010) was unconstitutionally vague failed. Also, defendant's statements to police were not involuntary and the seizure of evidence from his work computer was not unlawful.</SPAN></P>

On review of the district court's determination that the taxpayers lacked standing to challenge the statute, the court held that the taxpayers failed to establish standing because they could not show that the statute at issue involved a direct expenditure of funds generated through taxation. A &quot;direct expenditure of funds generated through taxation&quot; was a sum paid out, without any intervening agency or step, of money or other liquid assets that came into existence through the means by which the state obtained the revenue required for its activities. The tax credits created by the statute did not meet the definition of &quot;a direct expenditure of funds generated through taxation&quot; because tax credits were not expenditures.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a cooperative and a public counsel, challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, which affirmed the order of respondent Missouri Public Service Commission (PSC) approving an acquisition of a utility company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cooperative argued that the PSC improperly failed to consider an inadequate gift policy, which should have caused the rejection of the merger. The regulatory law judge precluded the cooperative from making an offer of proof as to this gift policy. In affirming, the supreme court determined that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.070(7)(2000) gave the regulatory law judge the discretion to preclude a testimonial offer of proof; however, the judge erred by failing to allow a written offer of proof. If such an offer of proof was not permitted, the decision to exclude evidence as wholly irrelevant would have been unreviewable by the courts, in violation of Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 18 and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 386.510 (2000). As to a recusal argument, the PSC commissioners were not judges, even though they acted in a quasi-judicial capacity. Therefore, the Missouri Code of Judicial Conduct did not govern their actions. The public counsel did not overcome the presumption that the PSC acted impartially, there was no evidence presented of actual bias, and those involved believed that the contacts at issue were not inappropriate and did not require recusal where not case had yet been filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was unlawfully engaged in real estate activities. The trial court issued a preliminary injunction, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court held that the corporation's actions did not fit under the exemption found in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 339.010.7(5)(d) (Supp. 2010). The corporation provided rental advisor and provided detailed advice about apartment search strategies. The constitutional challenges to &sect; 339.010 (Supp. 2010) were rejected. In a U.S. Const. amend. I, analysis, commercial speech was limited; therefore, a four-part intermediate scrutiny test was applied. There was a substantial governmental interest, and the challenged provision survived intermediate scrutiny. Because the statute served an important purpose and was a proper exercise of police power, there was no violation of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 were not violated because the exemptions under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 339.010.7 (Supp. 2010) had a reasonable conceivable rational basis. Also, &sect; 339.010.7 was not a special law in violation of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30). Finally, a vagueness challenge was rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county and convention commission sued the online travel companies that facilitated the booking of hotel and motel rooms via the internet. The county and convention commission argued that they were required to pay hotel and tourism taxes imposed by county ordinances and state statutes.

The online travel companies filed a motion to reconsider, and the trial court dismissed the case. The state supreme court found that (1) the county and convention commission's argument that the recent bill violated Mo. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court noted that, in its Ring decision, the U.S. Supreme Court held that capital defendants, no less than non-capital defendants, were entitled to a jury determination of any fact on which the legislature conditions an increase in their maximum punishment and that a defendant had the right to have a jury find the statutory aggravating circumstances necessary for the imposition of the death penalty. However, in Missouri, a guilty plea waived all nonjurisdictional defects, including statutory and constitutional guarantees; as such, Ring did not apply to defendants who pled guilty and waived their right to jury sentencing. Defendant's reasons for waiving jury sentencing were clearly strategic; he did not want to be sentenced by a jury because of the strong likelihood that jurors would sentence him to death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that, when petitioner pled guilty in 1991, he understood that a consequence of his plea was that he would not have his guilt or sentence determined by a jury, and the record demonstrated his understanding that his guilty plea would lead to him being sentenced by a judge, whereas a not guilty plea would lead to him being sentenced by a jury. Moreover, the record made clear that petitioner knew that the judge would be considering the State's recommendation of the death penalty. Petitioner remained bound by his strategic decision in 1991 to have his sentence imposed by a judge, not by a jury, and such was particularly true where he believed that judge sentencing would benefit him.

Defendant's offer of proof included: (1) that the third party's fingerprints were found on the victim's car, but defendant's and the victim's fingerprints were not; (2) the third party falsely denied that he had met victim; (3) the third party had an Iowa arrest for stalking a woman with the intent to assault her sexually; and (4) the third party was known to carry a shotgun in his vehicle. The supreme court disagreed. The &quot;direct connection rule&quot; required that the third party evidence directly connect him to the corpus delicti of the murder. The rule also rejected evidence relating to a &quot;disconnected or remote act&quot; outside of the murder. Considering defendant's evidence as to the third party in light of the &quot;direct connection rule,&quot; the trial court's conclusion that defendant's evidence did not meet the requirements of the rule was not a decision that was clearly against the logic of the circumstances and so unreasonable as to indicate a lack of careful consideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of the murder of three people and received a capital sentence. Petitioner challenged the sentence, contending that a capital sentence could not be imposed due to his mental status. On review of the denial of postconviction relief, the court held that counsel was not ineffective in his selection of an expert witness because, while the court rejected the expert's opinion in a different case, it did not hold that the expert was per se an incredible or unreliable witness but only held that the expert's opinion lacked evidentiary support. Further, under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.030.6, mental retardation, not fetal alcohol syndrome was a disqualifying factor, while a finding that he suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome would not disqualify him from receiving the death penalty but might have only mitigated his punishment. As such, counsel's failure to present expert testimony specifically related to fetal alcohol syndrome was not ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the child was unable to recall any information concerning the abuse, his reporting of the abuse, his videotaped interview, or the police investigation. The Supreme Court of Missouri found no error in admitting statements under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.075 (Supp. 2006) that the boy made to his mother and to authorities who investigated the bruising. There was no confrontation error under U.S. Const. amend. VI or Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 18(a) because the child was not rendered unavailable by his inability to remember at trial the abuse or his prior statements. No due process violation occurred under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV; Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because the trial court found that the hearsay statements were reliable, as required by &sect; 491.075, and the record supported that conclusion. Section 491.075 did not implicate the right to be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, in no way diminished the state's burden of proving every element of the crime, served a legitimate state purpose, and did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause. The hearsay statements, together with the other evidence, were sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

Although the property owner contended that the home was vacant, he never corrected or provided another address to officials. Without knowledge that the notice was not reasonably calculated to apprise the property owner, the sheriff was not required to take any further steps to notify him. In addition, the owner presented no evidence regarding the notice of the confirmation proceeding; he did nothing but merely allege that he did not receive notice of the confirmation proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, antisocial personality disorder, major depressive disorder, and substance dependence for alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and amphetamine. As a result of his schizophrenia, he experienced auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions. After appellant was convicted of offenses stemming from a series of homes invasions and the sexually assaults of female occupants, the State petitioned to have him committed as an SVP. On review, the court held appellant's commitment did not violate constitutional due process concerns. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.495.2 (Supp. 2009) did not obligate the State to provide treatment that would produce a particular outcome, as not all mental conditions were susceptible to treatment. Thus, the State did not need to successfully rehabilitate every SVP for Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.492 to be constitutional. Instead, the State served its purpose of treating rather than punishing SVPs by committing them to an institution expressly designed to provide psychiatric care and treatment.

One year later, the student-assailant attacked plaintiff student from behind with a boxcutter, slicing his neck open. The attack was unprovoked, as the two had never met.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was pregnant when she came to the United States.

The couple knew that the adoptive parents were seeking to adopt a child and arranged to introduce the child to the adoptive parents. The adoptive parents obtained custody of the child and thereafter instituted suit to terminate the mother's rights and to adopt her son.

As the trooper passed defendant's stopped vehicle, he saw defendant's bright headlights &quot;come on and stay on.&quot; The trooper turned around and drove back to defendant's vehicle &quot;to see if the driver needed assistance&quot; and to &quot;take enforcement action for failure to dim headlights.&quot; Defendant stepped out of the driver's seat and walked to the passenger side, looking at the tires. The trooper asked defendant what was wrong and defendant replied &quot;the car did not feel right,&quot; so he stopped to make sure there was not a problem. Defendant slurred his speech, his eyes were glassy and bloodshot, and he had problems maintaining his balance. Defendant sat down in the trooper's patrol car, and a computer check that showed that defendant's license had been revoked. In the patrol car, the trooper smelled alcohol on defendant's breath and defendant said he drank six beers. The trooper gave defendant a preliminary breath test, which came back positive for the presence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 565.020 (2000), which required a sentence of life without parole for a minor who committed first degree murder violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, U.S. Const. amend. VIII.  In Florida v. Graham, the United States Supreme Court considered whether the constitution permits a juvenile offender to be sentenced to life without parole for a nonhomicide offense. The Court determined that sentencing a minor to life without parole for a nonhomicide crime was cruel and unusual punishment because the lessened degree of culpability that minors have makes them less deserving of the most severe punishments. Juvenile argued that this reasoning should be extended to &sect; 565.020 because it resulted in minors receiving a mandatory, non-discretionary sentence of permanent incarceration for committing first degree murder. The supreme court disagreed. Juvenile's argument was flawed because Roper v. Simmons expressly and Graham implicitly recognized that life without parole was not cruel and unusual punishment for a minor who was convicted of a homicide.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the City of Sullivan, Missouri, sued appellant property owner, seeking an order compelling her to pay the necessary costs for a sewer connection.

The Circuit Court of Crawford County, Missouri, entered a judgment for the City. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City decided to charge higher sewer connection fees for properties in areas with new sewer access. A property owner argued that the City's sewer connection fee ordinance was a &quot;special law&quot; in violation of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30). The Supreme Court of Missouri disagreed. There was substantial justification for creating a class of new sewer connections that was required to pay higher connection fees before accessing new portions of the City's sewer system. The higher connection fees were imposed in a way that embraced all of the class to which the higher fees naturally related. The fees contributed to the City's ability to fund the sewer project as a whole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a school district and three individual taxpayers, challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, which rejected their claims that the Missouri Charter Schools Act, Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a decision was rendered against the district and the taxpayers on the constitutional issues, an appeal was filed. In affirming, the supreme court determined that the Missouri Charter Schools Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 160.400-160.420 (Supp. 2009), did not require a direct or indirect transfer of funds from the district to any of the local educational agency charter schools in the district. The money paid to the charter schools was state money, not locally levied funds. Even if the calculation used by the Missouri Legislature was an indirect transfer, Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 11(g) permitted use of the monies levied under it for all school purposes of the district. Charter schools within the district were public schools. Next, the Act did not authorize an unfunded mandate. The authorization of charter schools did not require new or increased activity on the part of the district. Finally, the district improperly included discretionary spending and federally mandated spending in its cost basis and failed factually to meet its burden of showing that the state decreased its proportion of funding state-mandated programs beyond that permitted by the Hancock Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court agreed. The defense strategy centered on proving that defendant did not leave &quot;the highway's right-of-way&quot; as charged in the original indictment. The defense was that the construction zone was part of the right-of-way. Defendant focused on the evidence that, if going over the white lines was considered &quot;leaving the right-of-way,&quot; every car was doing it and, therefore, his actions were reasonable and not criminally negligent. The amended charge shifted the focus of the evidence to the question of whether defendant's driving in the center lane was in a lane closed to traffic instead of a right-of-way. Therefore, defendant's evidence that the center lane was still part of the right-of-way was no longer applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state filed suit against appellant social worker alleging, among other things, Medicaid fraud. The Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, granted the state's motion for summary judgment and awarded the state actual damages in the amount of $ 45,385, civil penalties in the amount of $ 1,625,000, and, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 191.905.12 (Supp. 2009), treble damages in the amount of $ 136,155. The social worker sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The social worker argued that summary judgment was improper because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she &quot;knowingly&quot; submitted false claims, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 191.905.1(1). In addition, she argued that the civil penalties under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 191.905.12 violated the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions. She also argued that summary judgment was improper because &sect; 191.905.12 was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated due process and the prohibition on excessive fines, Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 191.905.12 was not vague, nor were the penalties excessive. In addition, summary judgment was appropriate because there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the social worker knowingly violated Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 191.905.1(1). The state submitted more than 300 copies of claims submitted by the social worker that were false, affidavits from the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit investigators in which they detailed her confession, as well as the social worker's own voluntary statement admitting what she had done; therefore, there was nothing left for a jury to decide.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of St. Charles County (Missouri) accepted the guilty pleas and found that appellant was a chronic offender under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.011 (2000), &sect; 560.011 (2000), and &sect; 577.023 (Supp. 2008). Appellant filed a motion for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found to have been a chronic offender by having pled guilty to or been found guilty of four intoxication-related traffic offenses. Appellant argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.023 (Supp. 2008) was void for vagueness. The court held that because appellant did not raise the claim of void for vagueness until his motion for post-conviction relief, it was waived. However, the court further found that even if appellant had preserved his constitutional challenge, his argument failed because &sect; 577.023 was not unconstitutionally vague. Under the facts at hand, the State used appellant's four prior convictions to enhance his penalty up to that of a class B felony, &sect; 577.023.5. Appellant was given ample notice by the clear language of &sect; 577.023 that having four or more intoxication-related offenses was proscribed conduct subjecting him to this enhanced penalty. Appellant did not plead any facts indicating that the State actually applied the statute in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner.</SPAN></P>

The inmates filed suit against respondents, the governor and others, and claimed that a legislative amendment removing conditional release eligibility violated the Missouri and federal constitutions. The Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) upheld the statute as constitutional and dismissed the claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates claimed that a legislative amendment to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.011 (1978), which removed conditional release eligibility for inmates convicted of certain violent felonies, violated the ex post facto clause, substantive due process, were retrospective in operation, and were unconstitutional. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.011 (Supp. 1990) was constitutional. First, the claims were time barred by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.110(3) (1986), which required a claim to have been brought within 10 years after the bill complained of had become effective. There was no constitutional or inherent right to early release from prison, and the inmates had no right of conditional release until the Missouri Board of Probation and Parole actually issued a date for conditional release, which had not occurred. The board always had plenary discretion as to whether to issue a conditional release date under both Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.011.5 (Supp. 1990) and &sect; 558.011.5 (1978). The board's consideration of granting conditional release to any of the inmates was a mere possibility, nothing more and was insufficient to support a claim for the creation of a disability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a patient and his wife, and cross-appellants, a doctor, a practice group, and a hospital (doctor), sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court Of St. Louis County (Missouri), which, following a jury trial in appellants' malpractice claim against the doctor, reduced the noneconomic damages awarded to the patient and eliminated the noneconomic damages awarded to the wife, based on Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 538.210 (Supp. 2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with appellants' argument that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 538.210, which applied new caps on noneconomic damages to causes of action that accrued before the effective date of the law, violated the constitutional prohibition of retrospective laws, Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Therefore, the new noneconomic damages cap could not have been applied to a cause of action that accrued prior to August 28, 2005. The doctor made numerous arguments on appeal, none of which were availing. The expert testimony was properly admitted because the doctor testifying was qualified and he was qualified to discuss the specific infection in this case, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 490.065. In addition, non-testifying doctors' statements were admissible both under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 490.680, and under the expert testimony statute. While it was correct that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 538.215 required the circuit court to express future damages at present value, appellants were not obligated to present evidence as to present value. The jury instructions given after the jury stated it was deadlocked were proper because they did not amount to coercion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded to the trial court to enter a judgment in accord with the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Missouri Prosecuting Attorneys and Circuit Attorneys Retirement System (PACARS) filed a petition for writ of mandamus to compel payment by respondents, a county and its commissioners, of the pension contributions required from it under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;  56.807 (Supp. 1995). The Circuit Court of Barton County (Missouri) found that &sect; 56.807 violated the Hancock Amendment to Mo. Const., art. X, &sect; 21. PACARS appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents quit paying pension contributions on behalf of its prosecutors beginning in 2002, when the Missouri Department of Social Services ceased reimbursing it for those contributions. The court held that the trial court erred in finding that the Hancock Amendment invalidated Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;  56.807 to the extent it required counties to pay pension contributions for its prosecutors. Pension contributions were encompassed within the phrase &quot;compensation of county officers&quot; as used in Mo. Const., art. VI, &sect; 11 and provided an exception to the Hancock Amendment for the payment of all such compensation; therefore, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 56.807 did not violate the Hancock Amendment. The word &quot;compensation&quot; could include pension benefits if those benefits were not excluded by the statute in question. The court concluded that Mo. Const., art. VI, &sect; 11 included within its scope contributions to pension funds on behalf of county prosecutors and circuit attorneys. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 56.807 unequivocally required counties to provide pension contributions to these county officers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in overruling his objections to evidence about the male victim's autopsy because the evidence was irrelevant to any issue at the retrial of the penalty phase for the murder of the female victim and the autopsy-related evidence was neither material nor legally relevant. The supreme court disagreed. The pathologist who examined the male victim's body described the injuries the male victim sustained, including the location and extent of the gunshot wound. That evidence was material to demonstrate the cause of the male victim's death and to corroborate testimony that he was found lying motionless on the ground. The precision of the wound and its location in the male victim's head supported the State's evidence that the female victim's murder was part of a plan. The testimony was a description of what the pathologist saw while performing an autopsy on the male victim. The jury heard evidence from several witnesses about events on the night of the murders, including the shooting of the male victim. Defendant himself testified about shooting the male victim and about his anger toward the victims that motivated the murders.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's attorney did not ask veniremember 1 any questions. The trial court sustained the State's motion to strike veniremember 1 for cause based on her statement that she was unable to state whether she could sign the verdict form. Veniremember 2 also claimed that he could consider both punishments, but said that he would not sign a verdict imposing a death sentence. Veniremember 2 maintained that position even though he had heard the prosecutor repeatedly tell others that the jury foreperson signed the verdict form not on behalf of himself or herself, but on behalf of the unanimous jury as a whole. Both veniremembers stated that they could not sign a death verdict. The veniremembers' responses revealed an inability to follow the trial court's instructions if that person were chosen as foreman of the jury.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Audrain County (Missouri) found in favor of respondent in his challenge to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 589.426 (Supp. 2008), which curtailed the activities of sex offenders on Halloween. The State appealed. The appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.147 prohibited sex offenders from residing within 1,000 feet of schools or child-care facilities. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 589.426 prohibited convicted sex offenders from going outdoors, turning on their outdoor lights, and handing out candy on Halloween, and required them to post a &quot;no candy or treats&quot; sign. Defendant and respondent did not challenge the validity of the statutes as applied to those convicted after the law's effective date, but challenged the law's application as to them, whose convictions occurred before the law's effective date. The court held that the 2004 law's residency restriction and the 2008 law's Halloween requirements, enacted years after defendant's and respondent's convictions, were laws that operated retrospectively as applied to them and imposed new obligations, duties, or disabilities. They made defendant and respondent take some action, not previously required of them, based on their previous conviction or face a new criminal charge, which violated their rights under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Therefore, as applied to them, they were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court quashed two of the writs because Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 10-2.010, which excluded an otherwise indigent person from representation on the sole basis that he previously retained private counsel, was contrary to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 600.086.1, which required consideration of a number of factors, including ability to make bond, income, and dependents, and was invalid. The second writ was quashed because the provision of Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 10-4.010, that allowed a public defender office to decline categories of cases, such as persons charged with probation violations, was contrary to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 600.042.3, which required the public defender's office to provide legal services to an eligible person facing a loss of liberty; as such, it was invalid. In making the third writ permanent, however, the court held that the trial court had no authority to appoint a full-time public defender to represent a defendant in the lawyer's &quot;private capacity.&quot; Because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 600.021 prohibited public defenders from otherwise engaging in the practice of law, a public defender had no private capacity as a lawyer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Mississippi County, Missouri, dismissed an information charging defendant with one felony count of possession of a loaded firearm while intoxicated, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.030.1(5) (Supp. 2008). The circuit court dismissed the charge on the grounds that &sect; 571.030.1(5) violated U.S. Const. amend. II and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.030.1(5) was overbroad and facially unconstitutional. The supreme court noted, however, that the overbreadth doctrine was limited to the context of the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I. Defendant's case did not involve a First Amendment issue. The overbreadth doctrine had no application, and there was no basis for holding that &sect; 571.030.1(5) was factually unconstitutional. Possession of a loaded firearm by an intoxicated individual posed a demonstrated threat to public safety. Consequently, &sect; 571.030.1(5) represented a reasonable exercise of the legislative prerogative to preserve public safety by regulating the possession of firearms by intoxicated individuals. The alleged facts constituted a violation of the statute and were within the power of legislative regulation under the police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, granted judgment in favor of defendants, Missouri state officials, on plaintiffs', school districts and others, claim that Missouri's school funding formula resulted in a public education system that was unconstitutionally disparate and inadequate. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that plaintiffs had standing to challenge the school funding formula under Mo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1(a). They lacked standing to assert that the alleged inadequacy of school funding violated their equal protection rights or the Hancock Amendment, Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 23. The individual taxpayer and student plaintiffs had standing. The trial court's error in permitting defendant-intervenors did not require reversal. Under Mo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1(a), where the legislature had provided the 25 percent of state revenue as required by &sect; 3(b), it had not failed in its duty under &sect; 1(a) to provide free public education. The school funding formula, Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 163 (Supp. 2008), did not violate equal protection, Mo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2. Because plaintiffs expressly disaffirmed that they sought to be released from any mandate, their Hancock Amendment challenge failed. Plaintiffs could not show that Mo. Const. art. X, &sect;&sect; 3, 4, and 14 restricted the legislature's discretion in shaping the school funding formula. The legislature had plenary power to act in crafting the school funding formula.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Missouri's dismissal, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.455.4 (Supp. 2007), of his motion to modify the custody and visitation provisions of a prior modification judgment.  The father challenged the constitutional validity of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.455.4 (Supp. 2007) and claimed that the statute violated his rights of due process, equal protection and access to the courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.455.4 (Supp. 2007) provided that, for a person who owes more than $ 10,000 in past due child support to seek to modify a child custody decree, the person first must post a bond in the full amount of past due child support owed as ascertained by the division of child support enforcement or reasonable legal fees of the custodial parent, whichever was greater. Considering the private interests affected, the risks of erroneous deprivation of the affected interests, and the government's administrative and fiscal burden, the court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.455.4 was constitutional. The statute constituted a reasonable balancing of the interests of a parent owing past due child support in excess of $ 10,000, the custodial parent who is owed the support, and the state's parens patriae interest in protecting their child's best interest. Therefore, the statute did not violate the father's due process or equal protection rights. The prerequisite in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.455.4 (Supp. 2007) of filing a bond before prosecuting a motion to modify custody is not an arbitrary and unreasonable barrier prohibited by the open courts provision of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>

The court found the evidence admissible pursuant to the inevitable discovery doctrine notwithstanding defendant's challenge to the validity of his wife's consent. The record showed that the detective would have discovered the evidence pursuant to a search warrant had he not relied on the consent. Further, the initial seizure did not affect the validity of the warrant that was obtained to search the items because the child abuse that was reported prior to the initial seizure established probable cause under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. The court also held that the State provided sufficient evidence for the jury to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. As to sexual exploitation, there was sufficient evidence that the photographs depicted sexual contact within the meaning of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.061(29) (Supp. 2004). As to child pornography, there was sufficient evidence that defendant intended to exhibit the photographs of the children as well as the internet images recovered from the hard drive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a jury of three counts of first-degree murder in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.020 (2000). The jury recommended three death sentences. The judgment on the verdict was upheld on appeal. Defendant filed a motion for post-conviction relief under Mo. R. Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murdering two victims then stealing a lockbox of methamphetamine. When police surrounded him at his home, he shot at the officers, killing one and wounding another. At trial, defendant defended on a diminished capacity and lack of deliberation defense, presenting experts who had diagnosed him with brain damage. He argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain a PET scan; a scan taken after his conviction confirmed the claimed brain damage. Trial counsel testified that she did not order the scan because she was concerned it might undermine the planned defense. Because the decision was trial strategy, the court could not consider it ineffective assistance. The results could not demonstrate any connection to defendant's behavior at the time of the crime. Further, the PET scan was cumulative evidence. Similarly, defendant's medical records were not introduced because it was not a crucial aspect of the case. An incident where defendant was struck on the head with a baseball bat was a part of a drug deal, and trial counsel did not feel it was mitigation- friendly evidence. These strategic decisions could not be challenged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, convicted defendant of attempted enticement of a child in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.151 (Supp. 2008), and sentenced him to six years imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.151 (Supp. 2008) was unconstitutional because it constituted cruel and unusual punishment, was vague, encroached on protected speech, and went into effect pursuant to an invalid emergency clause. The supreme court disagreed, holding that in light of the crime's seriousness, the minimum sentence of five years with no possibility of parole was not disproportionate. Nor was the statute vague; the only meaning Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.151.3 (Supp. 2008) possibly had was that a person found guilty of this offense was to receive a minimum sentence of five years with no possibility of parole, probation, conditional release, or a suspended imposition or execution of his sentence. Contrary to defendant's contention, the statute did not criminalize mere fantasy or other speech entitled to constitutional protection. Rather, the statue required an act of persuasion, solicitation, or enticement for the purpose of engaging in sexual conduct. Finally, the emergency clause was not invalid in that it expressed an immediate need for protection from sexual offenders for the public health, welfare, peace, and safety.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the trial court did not err in overruling a Batson challenge for a particular juror as the trial court did find one race-neutral reason to strike the juror at issue thus making it unnecessary to review defendant's argument that the juror's unwillingness to answer death qualification questions was pretextual. Furthermore, the trial court did not err in refusing to give jury instructions for second-degree murder without sudden passion and voluntary manslaughter. The failure to give instructions for the different lesser-included offenses was not erroneous or prejudicial as the jury was instructed as to a lesser-included offense and found defendant guilty of the greater offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father previously had been convicted of sex crimes involving his minor stepdaughter.

The court, in reversing, concluded that &sect; 452.375 did not violate the prohibition in Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 against retrospective laws merely because its prohibition on unsupervised visitation by child sex offenders was enacted after the parties' marriage was dissolved. At the time of the dissolution, the father was awarded only a right to supervised visitation, and the change in the law did not affect that right. Section 452.375 also did not interfere with the father's fundamental right to associate with his children under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV. The father still could maintain a relationship with his children by means of supervised visitation under Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Marion County (Missouri), which, in a jury trial, convicted defendant under Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's offense of sodomy with a child under the age of 14 years occurred prior to the effective date of &sect; 589.414. He pled guilty after &sect; 589.414 went into effect. After his release from custody, he registered as a sex offender. He signed registration forms advising him that he was required to register every 90 days and to notify the sheriff's department within 10 days of any change of address. The State's evidence included two registration forms, both of which stated that the victim was five years old. The prosecutor mentioned the victim's age on cross-examination. The court held that the application of &sect; 589.414 to defendant was not retrospective under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 because defendant's plea occurred after the effective date of the statute. The State did not violate Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 25.03(c) or its Brady disclosure obligations by not disclosing defendant's other registration forms because defendant knew he had completed those forms. The victim's age was relevant and not overly prejudicial in proving that the registration requirements applied to defendant's crime, and the State's inquiry was within the proper scope of cross-examination under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.050.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant City acquired property pursuant to a voluntary annexation that was located in the boundaries of appellee fire district. A dispute arose over whether fire protection services and receipt of related revenues for the annexed property remained with the district. The district filed suit for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. The Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, granted relief in favor of the district. The City appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In granting relief in favor of the district, the trial court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 72.418.2, 72.418.3 (2000) applied; on review, the City argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 321.320 (2000) applied, and that if Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 72.418.2 (2000) applied, it was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that applying the rules of statutory construction to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 72.418, 321.320 (2000) did not conclusively resolve their conflicting application. The provision in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 321.322 (Supp. 2007) and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 72.418 (2000)'s placement in the boundary commission act indicated that the application of each statute turned on whether the county had a boundary commission. To harmonize and give both sections meaning, the conflict between the two sections was resolved by applying Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 72.418 (2000) to counties with a boundary commission and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 321.320 (2000) to counties with no boundary commission. As such, the appellate court held that because the City was not located in a county with a boundary commission, &sect; 321.320 applied to exclude the annexed property from the district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant labor organizations attempted to strike down amendments to the state workers' compensation law. The parties filed cross-motions for a judgment on the pleadings. Respondent Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, Division of Worker's Compensation also filed for summary judgment. The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, granted the division's motions. The labor organizations appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature made significant changes to the workers' compensation system. Six of the labor organizations' claims argued that specific provisions of the workers' compensation act were unconstitutional because the application of those particular provisions deprived workers of due process, violated the open courts provision of the Missouri constitution or violated several other constitutional rights of the workers. The supreme court noted, however, that no individual injured person or group of persons joined in the action, and the claims were completely hypothetical. Therefore, it was premature to address whether there might be constitutional problems with application of the provisions to particular individuals. Nevertheless, the labor organization did present a ripe and justiciable issue in their request for a declaratory judgment as to the scope of the exclusivity clause in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.120 (2008) after the amendments. Workers who were placed outside of the workers' compensation system by the amendments could recover under the common law because the workers no longer fell within the exclusivity provision of the act, as set out in &sect; 287.120.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment on the pleading with respect to two of the counts was reversed. The trial court summary judgment was reversed with respect to one count. The supreme court entered declaratory judgment, declaring that the excluded workers had a right to bring suit under common law. In all other respects, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for rubbing his foot on the six-year-old victim's vagina. On appeal, the court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.075 was constitutional on its face and as applied in the case of a child witness who testifies and is available for cross-examination. The Confrontation Clause was not implicated in such circumstances. The court further held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because there was evidence from the victim, both at trial and in her pretrial statements to her mother, her stepfather, and a forensic interviewer that defendant had engaged in sexual contact by rubbing her vagina with his foot. The jury reasonably could have found that defendant's attempted explanation, that he was awoken from sleep by the victim moving up and down on his foot, false and that the false story showed consciousness of guilt. The court further held that even though the prosecutor erred by arguing during closing arguments that defendant was a sexual predator, it could not say that the trial court committed plain error by failing to sua sponte interrupt and draw attention to the statement by striking it and admonishing the jury to disregard it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, determined that appellant, St. Louis County Boundary Commission's (Commission) action in rejecting respondent city's amended proposal to annex property was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the key to the classification of a case as contested or noncontested was the requirement of a hearing. Consistent with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 72.403 (2000), a public hearing was held. However, the city was limited and witnesses did not give testimony upon oath or affirmation. There was no cross-examination of witnesses. There was no formal adherence to procedural rules of evidence. Because &sect; 72.403 did not provide for an adjudicatory hearing where the city was permitted to try its case before the Commission and develop the necessary evidentiary record, the case was not a contested case. The circuit court did not err in finding that the annexation proposal was in the best interests of the affected parties and that the Commission's decision in denying the proposal was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. The circuit court's finding that the proposed boundary line did not create pockets of unincorporated areas and, therefore, created an area that was compact was supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for the state board, and the city board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state board re-established a transitional school district (TSD), pursuant to Mo. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 162.621 (2000) and &sect; 162.1100. The city board argued that &sect; 162.1100 was unconstitutional because it violated the voting rights of city voters by removing duly elected board members. The court rejected this contention because both &sect;&sect; 162.1100 and 162.621 defined the powers of the city board, including the potential for transfer of their powers to a TSD, prior to the city board members' election. Because there was no infringement of the board members' constitutionally protected property interests, if any existed, the court did not consider the sufficiency of the process given them. The state board made its decision based on guidelines and criteria in a promulgated rule, and it did not conduct an irrational review or make a decision based on guesswork by considering other information relevant to the St. Louis public school district's stability and viability, including the school district's leadership and its finances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, defendants challenged the judgments of the Circuit Court of Webster County, Missouri, that found that each defendant met the definition of a sexually violent predator pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.480 et seq. (2000), arguing that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.495 (2000) was unconstitutional because due process required the State to prove that each was subject to commitment beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were committed as sexually violent predators under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.480 et seq. (2000). One defendant had a history of sexually violent behavior, usually involving children, and had previously sodomized a nine-year-old male cousin and sexually abused his son. The second defendant had a history of sexual misconduct involving his 16-year-old niece, five-year-old daughter, an four-year-old son. In the case of the first defendant, the trial court found that he met the definition of a sexually violent predator by clear and convincing evidence, while a jury made the finding as to the second defendant. On review, the court rejected defendants' constitutional challenge to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.495. The U.S. Supreme Court previously determined that whether to utilize a beyond or reasonable doubt or clear and convincing burden of proof to commit sexually violent predators was a matter of legislative prerogative and that the clear and convincing burden of proof did not violate due process. As such, Missouri's civil commitment law could constitutionally utilize the clear and convincing evidence burden of proof, and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.495 (2000) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, granted judgment in favor of Respondent, the Franklin County Commission (Commission), by finding that Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.073 (2000) violated the Hancock Amendment, to the extend it permitted the Commission to receive an increase in revenue based on an increase in assessed valuation without a vote of the residents of the county. The supreme court noted that, in order to determine the gross revenue of the county, the Commission simply applied the tax levy rate to the assessed valuation of existing property according to the formula (Tax Levy Rate) x (Assessed Value of Property) = Gross Revenue. The first sentence of Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 22(1) was not implicated. There was no increase in the levy. The taxpayers conceded that the increase in assessed valuation was only 0.7117 percent, while the consumer price index rose 3.5 percent. The final clause of &sect; 22(a) did not mandate a rollback of the tax levy. Section 137.073 was not inconsistent with &sect; 22(a). Section 22(a) did not prohibit counties and other political subdivisions from increasing revenues to keep up with the general increase in prices, so long as the increase was a result of the increased assessed valuation rather than increase in the tax levy rate and did not exceed the rate of inflation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which convicted defendant of first-degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stabbed and raped the victim. The court held that the trial court's imposition of the death sentence after the jury had found the facts necessary for a death sentence under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.030.4 did not violate defendant's right to jury trial. The instructions on determining whether death was justified comported with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.032.1(2). The jury was properly instructed that under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.030.4(2), it had to unanimously decide that the mitigating evidence outweighed the aggravating evidence in order to be required to return a life sentence. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.030(1) did not require the State to prove that the rape was completed while the victim was alive. Because the jury convicted on first-degree murder after having been instructed on second-degree murder pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.046 (2000), defendant was not prejudiced by a refusal to submit second-degree felony murder as a lesser included offense under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.025.2(1)(a). The victim's hearsay statements were admissible under the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception to the Confrontation Clause. Victim impact evidence and a soldier analogy did not render the trial unfair.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a juvenile and his parents, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Marion County (Missouri), which found that the juvenile's conduct violated Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents and juvenile argued that &sect; 574.010 was overbroad and unconstitutionally vague, and that there was insufficient evidence to find that the juvenile's conduct rose to the level of a true threat. The juvenile also argued that the adjudication of the delinquency proceedings without counsel violated his constitutional right to counsel. The only counsel at the juvenile proceeding insisted that he was only representing the parents. The court only considered the juvenile's right to counsel argument. The court determined that pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.211 (2000) the trial court had a duty to appoint counsel for the juvenile to assure a full and fair hearing. In addition, there was noting in the record supporting a waiver by the juvenile of his right to counsel. Finally, it was not established that the presence of the parents' attorney adequately protected the juvenile's statutory rights in the proceedings, especially considering the attorney's statement that he did not undertake join representation and the trial court's acknowledgement that there could be a potential conflict of interest between the juvenile and his parents that would preclude joint representation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Missouri Prosecuting Attorneys and Circuit Attorneys Retirement System (PACARS) petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel appellants, the County and its county commissioners (County), to pay additional monies into the PACARS retirement fund allegedly owed under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 56.807 (Supp. 2005). The Circuit Court of Pemiscot County, Missouri, rendered a summary judgment in favor of the PACARS. The County appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the County challenged the trial court's ruling that the statutory scheme set out in Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 56  for the compensation of prosecuting attorneys violated equal protection. The supreme court held that a rational basis for the disparity was evident in view of the several amendments to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 56.807 (Supp. 2005). Inclusion of the August 28, 2001, cutoff reflected the legislative intent to impose upon the counties no greater obligation than that which the voters approved, and that was a rational basis for the disparity. Whatever the changes to come in statutory retirement compensation for full-time prosecutors in third class counties, the fact remained that the voters in those counties that approved the prosecutors' full-time status before August 28, 2001, did so at a time when the retirement compensation was a fixed amount and without knowledge of the subsequent changes in the compensation amounts. Because there was a rational basis for the disparity in compensation for third-class prosecutors who became full-time before August 28, 2001, and those who became full-time after August 28, 2001, there was no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) invalidated the statute on the grounds that the bill in which the statute was passed violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 21 and 23. The State and defendant intervenors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The associations had no standing to bring the suit because they could not predicate standing on the perceived risk that their physician members would be subject to discipline.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether Missouri recognized a cause of action for pre-condemnation damages when the condemning authority was alleged to have caused undue delay and committed untoward acts in implementing condemnation proceedings. Although Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 523.259 (Supp. 2007) allowed landowners to recover damages if the condemnor abandoned the condemnation proceedings, it provided no remedy here because there had been no abandonment. Considering the constitutional prohibition against takings without just compensation, actions for condemnation blight were inverse condemnation claims that property owners were allowed to advance in order to recover consequential pre-condemnation damages, such as the claims brought by the property owners in this case for increased operating costs and for lost rental and lease income. The claims survived summary judgment because there were issues of fact as to whether the city's actions with respect to the time requirements of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 99.810.1(3) (2000) and inspections showed aggravated delay or untoward activity that could have merited recovery of pre-condemnation damages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From 2002 through 2004, the inmate had a position in the correctional center's hobby craft room and would sell his completed woodcraft projects to his family and to other inmates and their families.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the State. On appeal, the court found that the definition of &quot;assets&quot; in Mo. Rev.

The only funds that qualified as a wage or bonus were the monthly deposits from the state payroll, which the Attorney General properly excluded from his assessment of the inmate's assets. Further, the procedures in the MIRA afforded the inmate sufficient due process under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. However, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Attorney General had good cause under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.831.3 to believe that he would recover the statutory amount.

The title fully apprised the public and the legislature of the subject matter within the statute. &quot;Conduct&quot; as used in both Mo. Rev.

The denial of defendant's request for continuance was proper as he did not meet the first requirement under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.10. The secretary was an employee under the workers' compensation laws.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the ALJ's employment was terminated in 1989, Mo. Rev.

Consequently, the trial court was correct to hold that application of the amended version would constitute a grant of extra compensation in violation of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 38(a) and 39(3). The Missouri legislature could not waive such an express limitation on its power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgage company charged the borrowers a document preparation fee during loan transactions. The borrowers filed a class action suit, which alleged that the mortgage company was practicing law without a license under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.010.2 and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.020.1. Treble damages and prejudgment interest were awarded to the borrowers after such a violation was found, and this appeal followed. In partially affirming, the supreme court determined that the constitutional argument was not waived because it was raised prior to trial, the borrowers had a full opportunity to respond, and the trial court was able to address the issue. Next, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.020.2 (2000), which provided for treble damages, was not unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment or Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Further, there was no error in awarding damages to the borrowers who had paid the fee more than two years before filing suit because &sect; 484.020.2 did not extinguish any common law remedies available. The voluntary payment doctrine was not a defense, and the supreme court refused to read an additional recovery of prejudgment interest into &sect; 484.020.2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizen filed suit against respondent State challenging the constitutionality of Missouri's Concealed-Carry Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 50.535, 571.030, 571.090 -.094, which authorized the issuance of permits for persons to carry concealed firearms. The Ste. Genevieve County Circuit Court, Missouri, entered summary judgment for the State. The citizen appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the citizen argued that because the supreme court had declared in a prior case that the funding scheme of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 571.090, 50.535 (Supp. 2004) was unconstitutional, the concealed-carry permits issued under this section should have been declared &quot;null and void.&quot; The supreme court found that because the citizen did not allege that he, himself, was assessed an unlawful fee or tax, he was confined to the relief offered by Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 23 of the Hancock Amendment, which authorized declaratory relief but did not mention other forms of relief, such as injunction or damages. Because there was no allegation that the State had refused to comply with the supreme court's prior decision regarding the funding scheme, there was no need for the supreme court to take further action than the declaration of the law made in the prior decision. The funding mechanism of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.090 had already been declared unconstitutional, which was the relief the citizen was seeking. And his request to declare any permits issued in the County before that prior decision as null and void would not have been appropriate because it would not have remedied an unfunded mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A patient contended that the physician and other health care providers failed to diagnose and treat her for meningitis. The trial judge refused to dismiss the physician from the case due to his relocation; the trial judge determined that this tolled the statute of limitations under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.105 (2000). The physician then filed this prohibition proceeding. In granting relief, the supreme court determined that, under the principals set forth in Bendix Autolite Corp., the differential treatment of the physician under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.200 (2000), who lived outside Missouri but was otherwise subject to the state's long-arm jurisdiction under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 506.500 (2000), imposed an impermissible burden on interstate commerce, in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. To the extent that Poling v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to one count of tampering in the first degree and one count of attempt to commit a prohibited act on a gambling boat, under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 313.830.4(9) (2000). Defendant timely filed a Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.035 motion to set aside his plea of guilty to violating Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 313.830.4(9). The Circuit Court of St. Charles County, Missouri, overruled defendant's motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 313.830.4(9) (2000) plainly required proof that a person took money or something of value &quot;in&quot; or &quot;from&quot; &quot;gambling games.&quot; The term &quot;gambling games&quot; referred to games of skill or chance in a casino, not the casino itself. It was undisputed that defendant never participated in any manner in any gambling games. Instead, defendant lawfully purchased something of value--casino chips--and, with the assistance of a cashier, exchanged those chips for an excess amount of money at the cashier's window. The court found that defendant did not take money or anything of value that he had acquired either &quot;in&quot; or &quot;from&quot; any gambling game in violation of &sect; 313.830.4(9). The chips that defendant exchanged did not reflect an &quot;amount won,&quot; but instead reflected an amount that he lawfully purchased from the casino. The phrase &quot;in or from the gambling games&quot; did not include exchanging lawfully purchased casino chips for an amount in excess of the face value of the chips. The circuit court clearly erred in overruling defendant's motion to set aside his plea of guilty to violating &sect; 313.830.4(9) because he did not commit the crime.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, defendant confessed to the crime. Although defendant presented evidence of mental retardation through expert testimony, the State presented evidence of subaverage intellectual functioning.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prison inmate filed a legal malpractice action against respondents, a lawyer and his law firm. The lawyer filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the inmate failed to comply with the requirements of Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 460. The Circuit Court of Stoddard County, Missouri, agreed and dismissed the inmate's petition without prejudice. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In dismissing the inmate's petition, the trial court agreed with the lawyer that the inmate did not request the appointment of a trustee so that his malpractice suit could be brought in the trustee's name. On review, the inmate argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 460 was unconstitutionally applied to him because it violated his rights to access the courts. The supreme court determined that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 460.100, 460.250 (2000) set forth the powers of a trustee and the compensation for a trustee when appointed, but there was no language requiring the appointment of a trustee. As such, there was no need to address the inmate's constitutional claims. Because the plain language in the current version of Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 460 did not mandate that the trial court appoint a trustee, the trial court erred in dismissing the inmate's petition. The appointment of a trustee in an action filed against or by an inmate was permitted, but it was not mandatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly had sexual intercourse with a child that he was babysitting. At trial, the State sought to introduce evidence of defendant's prior conviction for a sexual offense involving a child. The trial court overruled defendant's objection and admitted the prior conviction under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.025 (2000). His objection to jury instructions was overruled, and he was convicted. This appeal followed. In reversing, the supreme court determined that defendant had the right to be tried only for the offense charged, pursuant to Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 18(a). Based on these sections, the supreme court had maintained a general prohibition against the admission of evidence of prior crimes. There were certain exceptions for admission of prior criminal acts, but admitting evidence to demonstrate defendant's propensity was not allowed, even if there was a finding of legal and logical relevance. As such, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.025 (2000) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party hurt his leg while playing football at a county park. The park had no admission fee, but there were fees assessed for use of certain areas of the park. The injured party filed suit, and summary judgment was granted for the county. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court held that liability was precluded under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.346 (2000) unless one of the conditions in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.348 (2000) applied. The injured party's argument based on the noncovered land exception was rejected; it was unnecessary to determine whether the fees charged by the county constituted a commercial purpose. The focus of the commercial purpose analysis was on the portion of the land where the injury occurred. Here, there was no admission for the area of the park where the injury occurred. Next, there was no equal protection violation under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. There was a rational basis for the immunity provided to owners in unincorporated areas, while not extending the immunity to landowners in incorporated areas. Finally, it was also rational to find that immunity was only granted for those permitting free access to their property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for criminal nonsupport. The conviction was premised upon a finding that defendant failed to provide adequate support for his chid. The circuit court held that a default administrative order issued by the Division of Child Support Enforcement and docketed with the circuit court constituted legitimization by legal process. The supreme court reversed and remanded however, concluding that the default administrative order did not constitute legitimatization by legal process. The State bore the burden of establishing that defendant owed a duty of support to his &quot;child,&quot; as that term was used in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 568.040. There was no final judgment and, thus, no &quot;legal process&quot; that judicially determined defendant's parentage. In the absence of a circuit court judgment, defendant was not prevented from collaterally attacking the administrative order used to establish his obligation of support that, in turn, served as the basis for this criminal prosecution. Because the State failed to prove that the child had been legitimated by &quot;legal process,&quot; the judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The case was transferred to Cole County, and the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) dismissed the suit. The chiropractor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court erred in sustaining the Board members' motion to dismiss because Mo. Rev.

However, the chiropractor failed to state a claim for malicious prosecution against the Board employee. The chiropractor failed to allege in his petition that the Board employee initiated or conducted her investigation with malicious intent. Thus, the case had to be remanded with instructions to dismiss those claims without prejudice. Finally, venue was proper in Cole County under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 508.010 (2000), the general venue statute, because defendants were members of a state board vested with discretionary decision making power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed suit, challenging the constitutionality of respondent State of Missouri's campaign finance reform bill. In an opinion dated July 19, 2007, the instant court found the removal of campaign limits could not be severed from a blackout provision that the trial court found was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Interested parties were invited to submit letter briefs as to the appropriate remedy, particularly whether the instant court's decision of July 19, 2007, should be applied prospectively only. A balancing test was used to determine the scope of any hardship or injustice that would justify making an exception to the general rule of retroactive application. Application of this balancing test to appellant was simple. Appellant did not suggest that he would experience injustice if the decision was applied retroactively to him. Appellant had refused to raise funds in excess of the limits the legislature previously imposed in his candidacy for elected office. Therefore, as to appellant, the July 19 decision was fully retroactive. The injustice of applying the July 19 decision retroactively to those candidates whose campaigns were concluded prior to that date was evident. However, a bright-line rule could not be drawn as to other candidates who were not parties to this action because the question whether retroactive application would work an injustice as to them was dependent on the degree of notice, reliance, and hardship shown by that particular candidate or class of candidates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court concluded that its July 19, 2007 opinion was fully retroactive as to appellant and was fully prospective as to those whose campaigns were concluded prior to July 19, 2007. As to other candidates, not parties to the action, it would be up to the Missouri Ethics Commission to determine whether to take enforcement action against other candidates or committees for campaign contributions they received prior to July 19, 2007.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff petitioner sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief asserting that a house bill had to be struck down in its entirety. The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, invalidated two statutes within the bill, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115.342 (Supp. 2006) and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115.350 (Supp. 2006). The petitioner challenged the judgment to the extent that it did not invalidate the entire bill. The State cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court invalidated two statutes within a campaign finance reform bill. In addition, the trial court invalidated and severed Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 130.032.2 (2006), which banned statewide candidates from accepting contributions during the legislative session, on separate First Amendment grounds. The State challenged the court's invalidation and severance of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;115.342 and 115.350, but the State did not appeal the invalidation and severance of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 130.032.2. The supreme court concluded that this was clear that the subject of H.B.1900 (Mo. 2006) is the general, core subject of ethics, rather than the narrow subject of campaign finance as determined by the trial court. Furthermore, candidate disqualification amendments of &sect; 115.342 and &sect; 115.350 fit well within the core subject of ethics. There was no single subject violation. That the two provisions were inseparably connected and dependent upon each other was conclusively proven. Moreover, subsection 130.032.2 could not be severed from the repeal of the campaign contribution limits in the other provisions of &sect; 130.032.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed to the extent that it invalidated and severed two sections of the legislation, and it failed to invalidate the repeal and reenactment of a statute in its entirety. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the grant of a new penalty phase.

The court affirmed the denial of guilt phase relief, holding that the motion court did not clearly err in finding that counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to the admission of a medical examiner's hearsay testimony explaining the conclusions of a deceased examiner who conducted the victim's autopsy, to object to closing argument that 30 seconds was a sufficient period of time to deliberate about killing a person, or request an instruction on a statutory mitigator of age.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator mother petitioned the court to prohibit respondent department of social services, family support division, from proceeding with its motion under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 454.496 (2000), to administratively modify the mother's existing court-ordered child support. The court issued a preliminary writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority placed in the family support division to initiate a process to modify judicial child support orders by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 454.496 (2000) did not offend the constitution, as such an administrative order was not effective until it was filed with and approved by the court that entered the order. Also, because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 511.350.4 (2006) merely codified the constitutional principle that an administrative agency could not unilaterally modify a court decree without encroaching upon the judicial function, and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 454.496 (2000) did not permit administrative modification of a court order, the two statutes did not conflict. Additionally, the mother's challenges to Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 1, &sect; 30-5.010 were without merit. Even assuming a regulation could have been a special law, Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 1, &sect; 30-5.010 was not one. To the extent that the mother sought to have the court declare the regulation invalid as a general matter, and not as applied to her, she was seeking declaratory relief.

The developer submitted the plan approved by the City, which included condemnation authority. When the developer failed to reach agreement with all the property owners to acquire the properties, it filed a condemnation action. The appellate court ruled that the finding of blight was not supported by substantial evidence. Based on the definition of &quot;social liability,&quot; the evidence was insufficient. In particular, the evidence before the City concerning fire, police and emergency services reports did not support a conclusion of social liability. While under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 353.020(1) (2000), an &quot;area&quot; could include buildings that were not themselves blighted, but which were deemed necessary for the redevelopment, there was a lack of evidence of social liability as to any portion of the area sought to be condemned. The area, therefore, failed to meet the statutory definition of &quot;blighted area.&quot; The City's ultimate goals for the area could not serve as probative evidence of social liability in light of the lack of evidence concerning the public health, safety, and welfare in the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two-part hearing procedure in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.498 did not violate due process. When considering the important underlying interest of protecting society from sexually violent offenders, and the ability of the sexually violent predator to obtain frequent review, it was not unduly burdensome to provide a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; to ensure that only those who made a legitimate claim could obtain a jury trial. Further, because the requirement that a sexually violent predator demonstrate his initial right to release by a preponderance of the evidence was narrowly tailored to the state's interest in keeping people committed if it was more likely than not that they would commit sexually violent crimes if released, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.498 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. However, appellant's petition, which alleged that his physical condition had deteriorated to the point where he would not be able to abuse anyone in the future, was not frivolous.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee associations filed suit challenging the district's refusal to bargain with them, and the district's rescission of agreements that already had been established. The reviewing court held that the right to organize and to bargain collectively applied to public employees as well as private-sector employees. While the law did not require the district as a public employer to reach agreements with the employee associations, if the district negotiated an agreement with its employee groups, it could not unilaterally impose a new employment agreement that contradicted the terms of the agreements then in effect. The guarantee under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 29 that employees had &quot;the right to bargain collectively&quot; was clear. Agreements that the district made with employee groups was to be afforded the same legal respect as contracts made between the district and individuals. As long as the duration and terms of such agreements complied with the limits provided by law for the districts to bind themselves, and were consistent with other statutes, the agreements were enforceable as any other contractual obligations undertaken by the district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant abortion providers challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which determined that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 188.250 (2005) was constitutional. The statute provided civil cause of action against any person who intentionally assisted a minor in obtaining an abortion without parental consent or an appropriate court order. Respondents included prosecuting attorneys and a state medical agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The abortion providers made several constitutional challenges to the statute. On appeal, the court found that the providers had standing to challenge &sect; 188.250, and that the claims were ripe because they were directly and adversely affected if they could not continue providing information and counseling to minors about abortion without risking liability under &sect; 188.250. The phrase &quot;aid or assist&quot; in &sect; 188.250.1 was narrowly construed to exclude the provision of information or counseling, but did include conduct that was not considered speech. Under this construction, &sect; 188.250 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I or free speech under the Missouri Constitution. Under this construction, the providers' argument that the judgment was vague was moot. Section 188.250 did not violate the Commerce Clause or the due process rights of non-Missouri health care providers because it did not apply to wholly out-of-state conduct and did not prohibit a minor from travelling out of state to obtain an abortion without parental consent. Thus, &sect; 188.250 did not create an undue burden or violate the right to travel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment by not employing the phrase &quot;regarding the reproductive rights and options of minors,&quot; which was used by the trial court, and as modified, affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) first entered judgment on June 18, 2003 in a medical malpractice case in which the jury returned a verdict for appellee patient and his wife (patient) against appellant medical group. However, the court set aside that judgment in October 2003 and ordered a new trial. The court of appeals (Missouri) ordered the circuit court to hold a new trial on the issue of past economic damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was to otherwise &quot;reinstate the original jury verdicts.&quot; The court of appeals ordered the circuit court to reinstate the jury verdicts and also to hold a new trial on the issue of past economic damages. The claims of all parties were not finally adjudicated until the circuit court entered its February 21, 2006, judgment. The group appealed and the patient cross-appealed. Inter alia, the patient argued that under the principles of joint and several liability set forth in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;538.230, the group was also liable for the 5% assessed against another medical group prior to the judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) in the other group's favor. The Supreme Court of Missouri held that, inter alia, the group was jointly liable with all those defendants whose apportioned fault was 40% or less. The other medical group was apportioned 5% fault. Under the plain language of &sect; 538.230.2, therefore, the group was jointly liable with the other medical group for the judgment in favor of the patient. The circuit court also erred in requiring the group to pay post-judgment interest from the original but subsequently vacated judgment of June 18, 2003.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court's judgment was reversed insofar as it required the group to pay post-judgment interest from June 18, 2003. The judgment was also reversed to the extent that the group was not required to pay to the patient the amount of damages apportioned to the other medical group. The judgment was affirmed in all other respects and was remanded for entry of judgment consistent with the instant opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant buyer sued respondent bank for common law fraud and a violation of the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act (MPA). The Circuit Court of Platte County (Missouri) dismissed the MPA claim pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 407.020 (2000); the buyer appealed. The jury found in the buyer's favor on the fraud claim and awarded him actual, but not punitive, damages. The bank cross-appealed the submission of the fraud claim to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the sale of property by the bank to the buyer, the bank was aware that the property was being investigated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in connection with illegal hazardous waste dumping thereon by its prior owner, on whose mortgage the bank had foreclosed. The bank did not disclose the EPA's investigation to the buyer. The state supreme court affirmed in part. Because the buyer's claim was one for fraudulent inducement to contract, it was not precluded by the inclusion of disclaimers in the contract itself, and the buyer presented evidence that the EPA investigation should have been disclosed despite the disclaimers. Further, the trial court erred in dismissing the buyer's MPA claim. The MPA had long barred the kind of real estate representations that he alleged, and the fact that it was not amended until 2000 to permit a private right of action for such misrepresentations, in addition to suit by the Missouri Attorney General, was no bar to the buyer's suit for actual damages and attorneys' fees. The MPA did not, however, allow recovery of punitive damages at the time of the bank's misrepresentations; therefore, the buyer could not recover them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the trial court's judgment dismissing the MPA claim. In all other respects, it affirmed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent university sued appellant association and others, seeking a declaratory judgment upholding the constitutionality of three city tax increment ordinances. The association counterclaimed, alleging that the ordinances were unconstitutional under, inter alia, Mo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 8, and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) granted the university summary judgment. The association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the university's bylaws showed that it was committed to the intellectual and spiritual ideals of the Jesuits, it was not a religious institution simply because it was affiliated with the Jesuits or the Roman Catholic Church. Although the university's president was a Jesuit, he served as the pleasure of an independent, lay board of trustees and was bound by the trustees' decisions. Moreover, the university's bylaws did not demonstrate that it was under the control of a religious creed; rather, the bylaws merely showed an aspiration to ideals. The university's mission statement demonstrated that it was committed to education, not indoctrination, and that its focus was on development of students, not on the propagation of the Jesuits' faith. Since the university was not controlled by a religious creed or sectarian denomination, Missouri's establishment clause did not render the ordinances that allowed the university to partner in the city's redevelopment unconstitutional. Since the ordinances did not violate Missouri's more restrictive establishment clause, they did not violate the federal Establishment Clause.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found there was no relief available in this case because the offender received a suspended imposition of sentence; the offender pled guilty under a statute that was later found to be unconstitutional; the conduct that constituted the basis for his guilty plea was not criminal. The trial court, however, lacked authority since his case was ended, to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea. The supreme court agreed with the offender that there was no reason that his plea should have any current effect, and he should no longer be required to register as a sex offender. However, the supreme court could not order the removal of the offender's name from the sex offender registry as the party who maintained the registry was not a party to the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alternative writ was quashed, and the offender's petition for an order that the judge remove his name from the sex offender registry was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, found that the Missouri Child Abuse Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.110 et seq. (2000), was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clauses of the U.S. and Missouri Constitutions, and granted summary judgment for respondent alleged perpetrators, the founder and an employee of a licensed child care center and residential child care agency. Appellant, the Division of Family Services, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Division investigator found probable cause to believe the alleged perpetrators neglected children under their care, and their names were entered in the Central Registry where they remained for 25 months. In finding that the Act was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, the supreme court held that the alleged perpetrators had a constitutionally protected liberty interest because dissemination of their names from the Central Registry created a stigma damaging to their reputation and effectively precluded their employability in the profession of their choosing. Thus, before they could be included in the Central Registry they were entitled to notice and a pre-deprivation hearing, at which a preponderance of the evidence standard applied. To the extent that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 210.110 and 210.152 (2000), permitted listing prior to a pre-deprivation finding of abuse or neglect, they violated due process and were invalid. De novo judicial review required application of a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof, and the Act prohibited either party from subpoenaing the reporter or alleged victim. The remainder of the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court's judgment was affirmed, except with respect to findings regarding the necessity of certain additional due process safeguards, including the alleged perpetrators' right to subpoena and to cross-examine sworn witnesses. Thus, the judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, Missouri, determined that appellant city was required to pay the entire amount certified by the city's Police Retirement System (PRS) and its Firemen's Retirement System (FRS) in past fiscal years. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the trial court erred in entering judgment in favor of the PRS and the FRS because requiring the city to pay the entire amounts certified violated Missouri's Hancock Amendment, Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 21. The supreme court found that despite the fact that the dollar amounts certified for the city to contribute to the PRS and FRS were greater than the dollar amounts certified for the 1980-1981 fiscal year, the city's requirements to pay were unchanged. There was no new or increased activity. The city did not show that it lacked sufficient income in the years at issue with which to pay the amounts certified to the PRS and the FRS. The city could not evade its responsibilities to the PRS and the FRS by refusing to pay them the amounts required and then arguing it spent the monies elsewhere. The statutes and ordinances relating to the PRS and the FRS, when taken as a whole, supported the view that actuarial soundness was the principle at the heart of the PRS and the FRS funding provisions. Actuarial soundness required the city to make its annual contribution of the actuarially-determined amounts certified by respondents, the PRS and the FRS boards of trustees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury unanimously found appellant to be a sexually violent predator (SVP) pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;632.480-632.513 (Supp. 2001). The Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, entered judgment on the verdict and ordered appellant to be placed in the custody of the Missouri Department of Mental Health. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that &sect;&sect;&nbsp;632.480-632.513 violated his right to due process, that the evidence was insufficient to prove he was an SVP, and that the trial court erred in admitting evidence (1) that he suffered from antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and (2) of actuarial instruments as applied to him. The statute complied with federal and state constitutional due process protections because it required the jury to find appellant presently posed a danger to society if released, and the statutory scheme provided for an annual examination of appellant's mental health condition, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.498.1(2) (2000). Evidence of appellant's ASPD satisfied the definition of &quot;mental abnormality,&quot; Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.480(2) (2000), given the link between ASPD and his sexually violent behavior. Appellant had impulsively committed sex crimes involving multiple acts of assault, one with multiple victims, and he exhibited no remorse or regret. Thus, there was sufficient evidence of the link between ASPD and sexually violent behavior for the jury to find appellant was a SVP. There was no abuse of discretion in admitting evidence of the actuarial instruments, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.065 (2000).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the State of Missouri, filed a petition to determine that appellant was a sexually violent predator pursuant to Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the trial court erred (1) when it denied his motion to dismiss the petition because Mo. Rev.

First, Missouri's Sexual Violent Predator statute complied with the due process protections of the U.S. and Missouri constitutions. Second, expert testimony on the issue of &quot;serious difficulty controlling behavior&quot; was admissible because the State's witness was qualified and the information she studied in making her evaluation of appellant and forming her opinion constituted facts or data of a type of reasonably relied upon by experts in the field, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 490.065.1, .3 (2000). Third, expert testimony, including evidence of actuarial instruments, was admissible under &sect; 490.065 because the actuarial instruments utilized constituted facts or data of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the field that were otherwise reasonably reliable and their utilization was linked with an independent clinical evaluation of appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee adult nightclub industry trade association sought a declaratory judgment asserting that Mo. H.B. 972 violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 21, 23. The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, ruled in the association's favor, declaring that the three provisions in question were invalid, unenforceable, and severed from the remainder of the bill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State challenged the trial court's declaration that the three provisions in question were invalid and unenforceable. The supreme court found that Mo. H.B. 972's original purpose was to repeal and replace certain statutes involving alcohol-related traffic offenses. Subsequent revisions in the title and content were to include certain non-traffic related alcohol offenses, such as the sale of alcohol to minors, added in the third version of the bill, could have been viewed as logically connected and germane to the original purpose of the bill. However, the three provisions regulating adult entertainment that were added to the fourth version of the bill during the next-to-last day of the session were not remotely within the original purpose of the bill, but rather constituted a textbook example of the legislative log-rolling that Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 21 was intended to prevent. The supreme court also found that the severance of the challenged sections from the remainder of the bill would not impact its other provisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Missouri Board of Pharmacy issued a cease and desist letter to appellant corporation. The letter ordered the corporation to stop selling animal legend drugs to consumers without a pharmacy license. In response, the corporation filed a declaratory judgment action. The Cole County Circuit Court, Missouri, denied the corporation's motion for summary judgment. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was a retail store that sold animal feeds and products. The pharmacy board investigated the corporation for selling animal legend drugs without a pharmacy license, alleging the corporation was in violation of the Missouri Pharmacy Practices Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 338 (2000). The corporation presented two arguments on appeal: first, that the circuit court erred in holding that the retail sale of veterinary prescription drugs used for treating animals constituted the practice of pharmacy; second, that the act, as construed by the circuit court, violated due process because it was unconstitutionally vague and it failed to inform persons of ordinary intelligence that the retail sale of veterinary prescriptions drugs to consumers for use in animals was the practice of pharmacy. Under the rule of lenity, the supreme court concluded that the statute had to be construed so that the sale of veterinary drugs was not considered the &quot;practice of pharmacy&quot; and subject to the criminal sanctions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 338.195 (2000). The &quot;practice of pharmacy&quot; statute could not be read to cover the retail sale of veterinary prescription drugs used for treating animals.</SPAN></P>
