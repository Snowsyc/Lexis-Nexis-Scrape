The case was heard by Alexander H. Sands, III, J., on motions for summary judgment. The Supreme Judicial Court on its own initiative transferred the case from the Appeals Court.<BR>ZUCKERMAN v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fifteen years earlier the town had adopted its rate of development (ROD) amendment with the stated aim of enabling it better to protect its interest in retaining its agricultural character. The landowner's 66-acre tract was zoned for subdivision, but because of the ROD amendment, she could develop only a few home sites each year. She challenged the ROD amendment as unconstitutionally interfering with her ownership rights, and both the trial court and the state supreme court agreed. The state supreme court had previously held that it was permissible to enact such ordinances for a limited period, to allow a town time to develop a land use policy that recognized the rights of landowners while also promoting other values identified by the town. After 15 years, however, the town had failed to implement many of the suggestions made in studies it had commissioned, which might have enabled it to protect its agricultural character without aggressively excluding newcomers. The continued enforcement of the ROD amendment, with no end date in sight, unconstitutionally limited the landowner's right to make profitable use of her property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, indigent criminal defendants represented by a public service agency, commenced an action against respondents, district court justices, alleging that the indigent defendants were detained because there were no available attorneys to represent them due to the Commonwealth's inadequately low compensation rates for such attorneys. Petitioners sought the court's intervention and relief under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to the low compensation rate paid to attorneys representing indigent criminal defendants, there was a shortage, which resulted in petitioners not having counsel available for assignment to them. Petitioners were thereafter held in lieu of bail or under preventive detention. They sought the court's use of its powers of superintendence to allow compensation to assigned attorneys at a higher rate than that provided by the legislature. The court found that petitioners were deprived of their right to counsel under Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 12, and that such deprivation resulted in severe restrictions on their liberty and other constitutional interests. The court noted that failure to provide counsel at early stages created concerns about whether petitioners would ultimately receive the effective assistance of trial counsel. The court reviewed the adequate remedies asserted by the Attorney General, and found that none provided the necessary &quot;relief&quot; for petitioners. Accordingly, the court found that petitioners established a case for relief under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211, &sect; 3. The court fashioned a remedy, which it indicated was to be modified by the justice assigned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court exercised its powers of superintendence and held that upon a showing that no counsel was available to represent a particular indigent petitioner, despite good faith efforts, such petitioner could not be held more than seven days and the criminal case against such a petitioner could not continue beyond 45 days. The matter was remanded to a single justice for adjustment of the implementation mechanism.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth sought further appellate review after the Massachusetts Appeals Court reversed convictions on three of four poisoning indictments against defendant. Defendant had been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, assault with intent to rape, drugging for purposes of sexual intercourse, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (four indictments), and mingling poison with drink with intent to kill or injure (four indictments).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant invited women to his apartment and served them drinks mixed with a prescription sleeping medication. The drinks rendered the women unconscious. At least one of the women was sexually assaulted while unconscious, and another died as a result of the combination of the drug and alcohol. Defendant was convicted of all charges but rape, and the appeals court affirmed eight of the convictions but reversed the convictions on three of four poisoning indictments. The court granted the Commonwealth's application for further appellate review and concluded that there was sufficient evidence for a rational jury to find defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and that the definition of &quot;poison&quot; as used in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 28, encompassed the medication. The court noted that a person of ordinary intelligence would be aware that there were risks associated with prescription drugs and that the jury was entitled to conclude that defendant's act of mixing his drugs with alcohol and serving the drink to victims showed an indifference to the risk of harm. Lastly, the court found that guilty verdicts of poisoning and involuntary manslaughter were not legally inconsistent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff personal representatives appealed the judgment of the Superior Court Department, Suffolk (Massachusetts), which dismissed their suit. The personal representatives sought to enjoin the Commonwealth from recovering the cost of Medicaid care from their decedents' estates or, where the money had already been recovered, to require the Commonwealth to return the funds, from funds recovered in a national tobacco litigation settlement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The personal representatives represented deceased residents who had received free medical care during their lives under the Commonwealth's Medicaid program, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118E, &sect; 15 et seq. The personal representatives based their claim on the premise that their decedents received such care for tobacco-related illnesses, and the Commonwealth already had recovered the cost of that care from settlement of its litigation against various manufacturers of tobacco products. They argued that the recovery from the decedents' estates amounted to double recovery and unjust enrichment, as well as violation of various state and federal statutory and constitutional provisions. The trial court dismissed the suit as barred by sovereign immunity. The court agreed that sovereign immunity barred the suit, because the legislature had never granted permission to have such relief as sought by the personal representatives. Additionally, the court held that the plain language of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii) precluded any claim against amounts recovered by the Commonwealth from a national tobacco litigation settlement, including a claim of setoff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 18C, the home invasion statute that formed the basis for the most serious charge defendant faced, was interpreted in a decision of an intermediate appellate court shortly before defendant was charged as requiring a showing that the initial entry was unlawful. Since defendant entered the home involved by permission given without knowledge of his violent purpose, his trial counsel believed it unlikely that he could be convicted and, after consulting with her, defendant rejected a plea bargain. At trial, the court actually instructed the jury that the entry was unlawful if he entered the home for the purpose of committing a crime therein. While the high court agreed with defendant that counsel's ineffectiveness in advising at the plea stage could be the basis for post-conviction relief even if a defendant's conviction after rejecting the plea occurred in a fair trial, it found no inadequacy in the representation provided to defendant. It was not unreasonable for counsel to have thought, after studying the statute and case law, that her proposed instruction regarding consensual entry would be accepted.

Const. amend. art. XLVI, &sect; 1, the Commonwealth had a compelling interest in obtaining the documents; (3) enforcement of the subpoena did not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because the alleged inhibition on religion was not a &quot;principal or primary&quot; effect of the subpoena, nor did its enforcement result in any excessive government entanglement; (4) the right to freedom of association was not implicated because there was no issue of &quot;privacy&quot; with respect to the persons with whom defendant had associated; and (5) enforcement did not violate Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Leave was granted to plaintiff owner to review the judgment of the Appeals Court (Massachusetts), which denied the owner's motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 60(a) and (b)(6). The owner had commenced an action for compensation pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 79, &sect; 14 upon dissatisfaction with the payment for the taking of his real property by defendant transportation authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A verdict in favor of the owner was returned. A judgment was entered in an amount reflecting a prior payment made by the transportation authority to the owner, with interest thereon from the date of judgment in a specific sum. The clerk had erred in calculating the amount of judgment interest by calculating it from the date of the judgment as opposed to the date of the taking and using the rate of 12 percent per year rather than the rate set by ch. 79, &sect; 37, which was 3.61 percent a year. The owner filed his motion seeking to have the interest recalculated at the rate of seven percent. The lower court held that the statutory interest rate did not necessarily equate to constitutionally adequate compensation in all eminent domain cases, but that the owner had waived his claim for additional interest by failing to raise the issue in a timely manner. The court agreed and held that the owner's Mass. R. Civ. P. 60(a) motion was inappropriate to raise a constitutional challenge to the statutory interest rate used and that his Rule 60(b) motion articulated no extraordinary circumstances justifying relief. The court noted that the owner should have raised the issue at trial.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 79, &sect; 37 to calculate the interest to be awarded as part of an eminent domain damages case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city effected a taking of two parcels of land, and the landowner filed an action for its damages. The landowner did not introduce any evidence on the interest issue at trial, but instead sought leave to produce affidavits or testimony after trial. Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court first held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in agreeing to entertain the landowner's request, particularly where the city voiced no procedural objection at the time. Moreover, because the landowner's later &quot;amended&quot; motions were untimely, the court considered only whether the trial judge, in denying the original motion as filed, committed error. Concluding that he did not, the court noted that, on the landowner's own calculation, a rate as low as 6.5 percent would satisfy constitutional requirements and the rate set by &sect; 37 was 5.88 percent for this particular taking. Because the landowner cited no precedent showing that this discrepancy was below constitutional requirements, it did not meet its burden of demonstrating that the statutory rate was so unreasonably low as to deprive it of just compensation for the delay in payment of its damages.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 30A, which did not include a jury trial on the employee's claims; (2) case law which allowed the MCAD to award damages for emotional distress was still valid; but (3) a finding of discrimination or retaliation was no longer sufficient, by itself, to permit an inference or presumption of emotional distress, and trial courts were required to ensure that a decision by the MCAD which awarded damages for emotional distress was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, they challenged &sect; 32 of the Act, alleging that it violated the uniformity requirement of Mass.

The court first determined that long-term capital gain income was in fact income derived from property within the meaning of art. 44. Accordingly, it was subject to the uniformity requirement. The court concluded that the result of the effective date of May 1st for changing the long-term capital gains tax rate resulted in two separate tax rates on long-term capital gains realized in calendar year 2002, which violated Mass.

Laws ch. 123A required that he be confined in a secure facility until the conclusion of trial. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect;&sect; 13, 14 required confinement at a secure facility after a finding of probable cause. The requirement that he be confined in a secure facility until the conclusion of trial did not violate due process. Given the procedural safeguards that protected him under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 14, confinement was narrowly tailored to further a legitimate and compelling governmental interest, which was protection of the public from harm by persons likely to be sexually dangerous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Department of Telecommunications and Energy, determined that plaintiff utility company overcharged its gas customers, and ordered it to refund the amount to ratepayers. The utility appealed under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 25, &sect; 5. A single justice reserved and reported the matter, without decision, to the full court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department found that the utility company improperly overcharged its ratepayers $ 675,052 by including inventory finance charges (IFCs) in both its base rate and its supplemental cost of gas adjustment clause (CGAC). On appeal from the refund order, the utility company claimed that, in the absence of evidence that a specific amount in its 1984 base rate was attributable to IFCs, the Department lacked substantial evidence that the company double charged consumers. The court disagreed. That the exact amount of IFCs collected through the base rate was unknown did not detract from the substantial weight of the evidence demonstrating that such charges were included in the base rate. The utility company also maintained that, in any event, any overcharges were not illegal as a matter of law, but the court determined that it failed to carry its heavy burden of proving that its overcharges were either permitted or endorsed by the Department. Next, the court determined that an order retroactively adjusting a CGAC was well within the Department's general supervisory authority over utility costs. The court also rejected the argument that the order constituted a confiscation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to county court where a judgment was to be entered affirming the Department's findings that the utility company illegally overcharged its customers $ 675,052, and its order requiring the utility company to reimburse its ratepayers for the overcharges in the manner specified by the Department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth appealed the Massachusetts Superior Court's dismissal of the indictments charging defendant with rape of a child under 16. The trial dismissed the case based on the &quot;interests of public justice.&quot; The issue was whether Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 30 permitted a judge, prior to verdict, finding, or plea, to dismiss a legally adequate criminal indictment in the &quot;interests of public justice&quot; over the Commonwealth's objection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled not guilty to all four indictments and moved for disposition under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 87, asking the court to place him on pretrial probation and to continue the case without a change of plea or an admission to sufficient facts. The Commonwealth objected to the use of pretrial probation as a disposition, requested that the indictments proceed to trial, and, in the alternative, demanded that the judge hold a hearing pursuant to Brandano before dismissing the indictments. The trial court placed defendant on pretrial probation for six months and indicated her intent to dismiss the case. The trial court denied the Commonwealth's motion to reconsider. The appellate court held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 23, explicitly forbid a prosecution of rape of a child from being placed on file or continued without a finding. The conclusion that judicial power did not extend to authorize a judge to dismiss an otherwise legally adequate indictment, prior to verdict, finding, or plea, in the &quot;interests of public justice&quot; was inescapable, as it would be a violation of the separation of powers as set out in Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 30.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants could not obtain marriage licenses because same-sex marriages were not recognized. The state supreme court held Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 207, the marriage licensing statute, did not permit same-sex couples to marry. Denials of the applicants' attempts to marry involved individual liberty and equality safeguards of the Massachusetts Constitution, protecting freedom from unwarranted government intrusion into protected areas of life and freedom to partake in state benefits. Under the equality and liberty guarantees, regulatory authority had to be rationally related to a permissible legislative purpose. Chapter 207 was not rationally related to the Commonwealth's asserted rationales for prohibiting same-sex marriage: (1) providing a favorable setting for procreation; (2) ensuring a two-parent family with one parent of each sex for child rearing; and (3) preserving state and private financial resources. Procreation was not a necessary component of civil marriage, forbidding same-sex marriage would not increase opposite-sex marriages in which children were raised, and a ban on same-sex marriage was not justified by the alleged financial independence of same-sex couples.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parent corporation, a Minnesota food producer, owned two upscale mail order retailers, one in Washington and one in Massachusetts. The parent did not interfere in the subsidiaries' management, and ultimately sold both of them. When it sold the Massachusetts subsidiary, in a two-step transaction involving sales of tangible and intangible assets, the parent elected to treat the sale of stock as a sale of assets pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 338(h)(10). The court upheld as supported by substantial evidence all the administrative determinations. First, since the three entities did not operate as a unitary business, the sale of the Washington subsidiary had nothing to do with Massachusetts at all. Computing Massachusetts gross income just as federal gross income was computed, the income realized by the Massachusetts subsidiary from the deemed sale of assets was gross income in Massachusetts. Finally, since a sale of trademarks and other intangibles in a separate transfer through a specially established Delaware entity was undertaken solely to avoid taxation in Massachusetts, the sales of tangibles and intangibles were treated as a single source of gain taxable to the parent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates had been improperly housed in near solitary confinement for nondisciplinary reasons, and were entitled to procedural protections. The commissioner argued that the trial court erred by fashioning an equitable remedy that awarded good time credits that were not earned, in disregard of the requirements of &sect; 129D. The high court held that the trial court did not have the power to grant equitable relief to the inmates in the form of good-time credits. The commissioner's decision to limit the opportunities for inmates in the East Wing to earn good time credits was based on a rational determination to allocate resources where they could be utilized most effectively. That decision was within the commissioner's discretion. The inmates were not illegally denied the opportunity to earn good-time credits. The administrative decision that resulted in the wrongful confinement of the inmates was unrelated to the decision to offer fewer opportunities to earn good-time credits, and, therefore, the order necessitated by the former should not have implicated the latter.</SPAN></P>

The highest appellate court found that the relief sought was neither compelled by the language of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268A, &sect; 25, nor consistent with the statute's purpose. The employee was under indictment during the entire period. He was never eligible to perform any public duties during that time and was most assuredly not entitled to reinstatement. The highest appellate court found that the criminal proceedings against him did not terminate until he pleaded guilty to the federal indictments. Those proceedings were considered to have terminated in a finding or verdict of guilty, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268A, &sect; 25. The employee could not benefit from his criminal conduct at the expense of the taxpayers merely because the federal and state prosecutors cooperated to bring him to justice, and dismissed the state charges.</SPAN></P>

Complaint received and sworn to in the West Roxbury Division of the District Court Department on April 6, 2001. A motion to dismiss was heard by Robert C. Rufo, J., and questions of law were reported by him to the Appeals Court. The Supreme Judicial Court on its own initiative transferred the matter from the Appeals Court.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Our answers to the reported questions are: 1. Exposure or attempted exposure of genitalia is not an essential element of an open and gross lewdness offense prosecuted under G. L. c. 272, &sect; 16. 2. The defendant did not have fair notice that exposure of &quot;thong&quot; clad buttocks could be prosecuted as an open and gross lewdness offense under G. L. c. 272, &sect; 16.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with open and gross lewdness, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 16, after pulling his pants down in front of four 13-year-old girls, exposing his buttocks, along with a pair of red &quot;thong&quot; underwear. After denying his motion to dismiss, the judge reported two questions to the Appeals Court (Massachusetts): was exposure of genitalia an essential element of the charge, and was there fair notice? The report was then transferred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court reported the instant questions to the lower appellate court, pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 34. The highest appellate court then transferred the report to itself. Defendant argued that showing his &quot;thong&quot; underwear was not a crime, and pointed to the number of people who were seen wearing &quot;thongs&quot; on public beaches. The highest appellate court found that it could be a crime. A conviction of open and gross lewdness required the Commonwealth to prove, among other elements, intention, manner, and impact. The gross lewdness had to be done in such a way as to produce alarm or shock, and it had to, in fact, cause alarm or shock to the victim. Therefore, exposing buttocks, with &quot;thong&quot; underwear, such as defendant did to the 13-year-old girls, in a school area where it was totally unexpected, could constitute gross lewdness, while wearing the same &quot;thongs&quot; on a beach might not. There was no requirement for the exposure of genitalia. However, the highest appellate court found that defendant in the instant case was not provided fair notice that deliberately exposing his thong-clad buttocks might be illegal. The statute was therefore unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Exposure or attempted exposure of genitalia was not an essential element of an open and gross lewdness offense prosecuted under the instant statute. Defendant did not have fair notice that exposure of &quot;thong&quot; clad buttocks could be prosecuted as an open and gross lewdness offense under the statute.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 6, &sect; 167 et seq., prohibited them from releasing the information. The newspaper sued the district attorneys who refused to release the information and obtained a judgment declaring that certain docket numbers were subject to disclosure. On appeal, the state supreme court held that docket numbers of criminal cases prosecuted in public judicial proceedings, correlated with information that was also available from a court or other public records, but not correlated with defendant-specific information, were public records that were subject to mandatory disclosure under Mass.

Gen. Laws ch. 61A, &sect; 14, alleging that defendant corporation's sale to the trustee was for nonagricultural purposes. The Land Court Department (Massachusetts) granted summary judgment for the trustee. The town appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The locus was assessed as agricultural land and thus was taxed at a lower rate than other land. Defendant former locus owners transferred the locus to defendant corporation, which they formed, and the corporation sold the locus to the trustee for the benefit of defendant trust. The trustee warranted by recorded affidavit that he would use the locus for agricultural purposes. He later contracted to sell the locus to defendant developer, which planned to build residences thereon. Under &sect; 14, if agricultural land was sold for or converted to non-agricultural uses, the town had, for 120 days, a first refusal option to buy the land. The land court found that the town's evidence did not show that, when the trustee acquired the locus, he intended to use it entirely for nonagricultural purposes. The appellate court vacated the judgment. The town presented evidence indicating that the trustee never intended to use the locus for agricultural purposes. The land court's finding that the trustee intended to retain a large portion of the locus in agricultural use was inappropriate in the summary judgment context, as in so doing the trial court posed and then decided a question of fact.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 111, &sect; 70, had been purely an accident, and, in any case, the harm suffered by the child and his family as a result of the destruction of the evidence was in itself catastrophic, as it deprived them of a cause of action against persons whose liability was not limited by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 85K. Since the $ 20,000 statutory cap on damages awardable against charities admitted of no exceptions, however, even though it was presented as an affirmative defense for pleading purposes, it was not a defense that the trial court had the power to strike.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the default judgment as to liability, but vacated the assessment of damages and directed that damages be assessed in the amount of the statutory cap, plus interest and costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs,18 parking lot operators and owners, sued defendant Massachusetts Secretary of Administration and Finance, seeking a declaratory judgment that 1999 Mass. Acts ch. 16, as amended by 2000 Mass. Acts ch. 72, &sect;&sect; 4-6, dealing with an excise tax, was unconstitutional. The Superior Court, Norfolk (Massachusetts), entered judgment, granting the Secretary's motion for summary judgment. The owners' application for direct review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The law created a parking and traffic management zone, which was defined as the area within the Towns of Foxborough, Sharon, Walpole, and Wrentham, Massachusetts, within a three mile radius of the center of a football stadium. It provided that an annual aggregate amount of $ 400,000 would be collected from those who were licensed to operate open-air parking lots within the parking and traffic management zone for stadium events, under Mass. Acts ch. 16, &sect; 7(b)(2), as amended by 2000 Mass. Acts ch. 72, &sect; 4. The owners argued that the law at issue was unconstitutional under numerous provisions of the state and federal constitutions. The secretary conceded, for purposes of the instant litigation, that this was an excise tax. The appellate court found that the power of the state to impose excises on business corporations was very broad, subject only to reasonableness. The instant tax did not constitute an improper taking. It was undertaken with a valid public purpose and the taxes were to be deposited into the general fund. The promotion of public safety was an important public purpose, and any private benefits were merely incidental. The law was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 278, &sect; 33E, the court granted direct review of a judgment on jury verdict of the Superior Court Department, Essex (Massachusetts), which convicted him of first-degree murder, kidnapping, and aggravated rape. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court conducted the jury charge in a manner that deprived him of a public trial by jury and that his counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted as a principal in a brutal rape-murder, although he claimed to have been too drunk to form an intent to assist his friend in the actual violence. The high court, as it was required to do in capital cases, reviewed the proceedings in detail, and found no error. The trial court acted within its discretion in allowing jurors to take notes during the complicated part of the charge dealing with liability as a principal, but forbidding them to take notes during the general instructions, because such principles as reasonable doubt were constantly reiterated throughout the charge. There was also nothing unreasonable about forbidding people to enter or leave the courtroom during the charge. As these actions were proper, counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to them, nor should counsel have objected to jury instructions that were correct statements of law, or, in one case, at worst harmless error. Counsel's frank admission that defendant was present during the crime did not preclude the presentation of the best defense possible for a client who offered very few bases for a defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer approached defendant after observing him with an open container. When defendant gave what the officer concluded to be a false name and age, the officer arrested defendant for drinking in public and frisked him, recovering a key chain, which he placed on the police car's roof. The officer, along with another, used the keys to unlock a nearby car, in hopes of ascertaining defendant's identity, at which time one of the officers noticed cocaine in the car through the front windshield. Defendant was charged and sought to suppress the keys and cocaine. The district court denied the motion to suppress, but the appeals court determined that suppression was required, and reversed the district court's denial of the motion to suppress. The supreme court held that the search and seizure of the keys was permissible under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 1 as a search incident to arrest where the hard object could have been used as a weapon. However, the use of the keys as an investigatory tool was improper and the impropriety tainted the discovery of the cocaine because the police were entitled to remove the keys only for safety reasons and not for investigative purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the district court's order denying the motion to suppress and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A single justice reported to the full court an action commenced in Suffolk County (Massachusetts) in which plaintiff judges challenged the constitutionality of statutory amendments contained in 2001 Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendments challenged by the judges inserted new language into many statutes dealing with court administration, defining the responsibilities of court clerks, probation commissioners, and others, for running their offices and filling vacancies.

The high court held that the amendments did not violate separation of powers principles, nor did they usurp the judges' inherent powers to run their courtrooms. Construed narrowly, the amendments simply clarified administrative powers that the clerks and commissioners had exercised all along. The high court saw no reason to interfere in the legislative decision to enact the amendments as part of an appropriations bill, deferring to the legislature's power to determine its own internal processes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no constitutional problems with the amendments and remanded the matter to the single justice for entry of a suitable judgment, in the county court, in accordance with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy and the Smart Buildings Policy Project appealed a Suffolk Superior Court (Massachusetts) ruling that Mass.

Mass. Regs. Code tit. 220, &sect; 45.03(1) (2000) was similarly invalid. The Department's expansion of the definition of &quot;utility&quot; to include a recipient of services was a radical change in the historical use of the word by the legislature. The regulations at issue were designed to regulate private property owners who did not fall within the class of persons that the legislature authorized the Department to regulate and were ultra vires of the enabling legislation,&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 166, &sect; 25A. Because Mass. Regs. Code tit. 220, &sect; 45.03(1) no longer applied to buildings or to private landowners, the basis for challenging its validity was eliminated.

The mother filed an application for direct appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was living apart from the adjudicated father of the child. The maternal grandfather sought visitation rights to the child. The trial court agreed with the mother's claim that the grandparent visitation rights statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that the statute survived a facial challenge on due process grounds and also did not violate equal protection insofar as the mother's statutory classification was concerned. The statute satisfied strict scrutiny because the appellate court's construction of the statute narrowly tailored it to further the compelling state interest in protecting the welfare of a child who had experienced a disruption in the family unit from harm. Because the classification narrowed the impact of the statute, while furthering a compelling State interest, it survived the equal protection challenge. Therefore, the action should not have been dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment dismissing the complaint was vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim telephoned her mother and said her car would not start but that the man who lent her the cell phone was giving her a ride. When the victim did not show up, her mother called police, who traced the cell phone to defendant. He went to the police, admitted giving the victim a ride, and said he smoked marijuana with her. He did not consent to a search of his car, since, he said, it contained a &quot;pot pipe.&quot; Police seized his truck and clothes. The victim's body was later found, and defendant's semen was found mingled with her blood. The appellate court held that the warrantless seizure of the truck and clothes to prevent destruction of evidence was proper, as police had probable cause to believe they might provide evidence that defendant harmed the victim. Defendant's admission of drug use provided further justification to seize the truck. Though the prosecutor's statements that the victim &quot;didn't deserve to die this way,&quot; and that a defense tactic was &quot;despicable&quot; were improper, they did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, as the evidence of guilt was very strong. The victim's diaries were properly excluded under the rape-shield statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was considerable evidence that the juvenile's arrest for disorderly conduct was a mistake resulting from his presence near the scene of a fight. The charges were eventually dismissed on his motion, and he also moved for expungement of his police and probation records. The high court held that while the trial court had the authority to order expungement of a juvenile's police record, since otherwise he would have had no remedy, it lacked authority to order expungement of the probation department records because Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276 contained a very detailed statutory scheme that protected juveniles' records.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 100A severely restricted access to the information in the records, and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 100B provided the method for having the records sealed altogether. The plain language of the statutes indicated that these were the remedies to which juveniles were to look.</SPAN></P>

In the interim, he was tried, convicted, and sentenced in the underlying criminal case. Thus, the primary relief sought by defendant in his Mass. Gen.

However, defendant argued that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 58, was unconstitutional, as it failed to include procedural safeguards similar to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 58A, and that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 58A, was unconstitutional in failing to require a bail hearing immediately on expiration of a 90-day detention period.

Chapter 123A met the requirements of Hendricks as it required a finding that the offender suffered from a mental condition that created a likelihood that he would engage in sexually dangerous conduct in the future, and that the prohibited behavior was the result of a mental condition that caused a serious difficulty in controlling behavior. Further, ch. 123A was remedial, not punitive; thus the prohibitions of ex post facto and double jeopardy did not apply.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 71, &sect;&sect; 38, 38G objectives to reform Massachusetts' public education by establishing and achieving specific educational performance goals for every child and by holding educators accountable for their achievement. The regulations, on their face, did not violate plaintiffs' due process or equal protection rights, did not conflict with collective bargaining laws, were not arbitrary and capricious, and were otherwise constitutionally sound. A focus was on under-performing schools and particularly low-performing mathematics programs. That socieconomic factors may have played a significant role in student achievement of educational goals did not satisfy plaintiffs' burden to challenge the regulations' validity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters argued (1) &sect; 1 was unconstitutional under Mass. Const. amend. art. 101, amended by Mass.

The 2000 United States census showed that, as a result of population growth and shifts, the representative districts no longer met federal population equality standards and had to be significantly altered. The new ideal representative district population was 39,682 persons. All recommended districts were within the federal constitutional purposes presumptively permissible plus or minus five percent range standard. Article 101's emphasis was on population, not territorial, equality. There was no best plan. The voters did not demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt the legislature's exercise of its discretion was unreasonable or was purposeful political gerrymandering leading to a disproportionately low representation of Republicans in the house as a whole.</SPAN></P>

The mayor's alternative plans to the redistricting statute, which met the territorial integrity requirement without sacrificing the competing goal of population equality, were not presented to the legislature. The supreme judicial court, in considering the alternative plans as evidence that a plan with fewer divisions of the city was possible, held that as long as the legislature had a reasonable justification for drawing the districts as it did, the supreme judicial court would not question the legislature's determination by comparing its selected plan to alternative plans that were not before it. The redistricting process which required the legislature to avoid the division of cities, towns, and counties &quot;as nearly as may be&quot; could not be interpreted to require that the legislature adopt the plan with the absolute minimum number of districts that crossed county, town, or city lines.</SPAN></P>

The company further alleged the amendment to the statute improperly delegated legislative power to an administrative body because it did not provide sufficient guidance to a municipality accepting the option and it did not provide for judicial review. The supreme court concluded the statute was constitutional and properly delegated taxing authority to municipalities. Specifically, the supreme court found the local option, contained in the statute, did not result in disproportionate taxation of property owners within the same municipality.

The supreme court concluded the trial judge did not err in denying defendant's motion for required findings of not guilty with respect to the three counts of larceny. The supreme court reasoned a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of larceny by false pretenses beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the supreme court determined defendant's larceny convictions could not stand because the jury was only given instructions as to traditional larceny. In light of that conclusion, the supreme court found defendant could not be adjudicated a common and notorious thief pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &sect; 40. Finally, the supreme court agreed with the appellate court that the judge's personal feelings interfered with his sentencing decision.

The court held that the proposed legislation violated freedom of expression guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. I and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A single justice sitting in the instant court for the County of Suffolk (Massachusetts) referred to the full court an action by plaintiff voters and candidates seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against defendant state officials to effectuate the Massachusetts Clean Elections Law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 55a, &sect; 1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Massachusetts voters passed an initiative that became the Massachusetts Clean Elections Law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 55A, &sect; 1 et seq. It provided a mechanism whereunder candidates who satisfied a complicated certification process could receive public campaign funding. To assure its inclusion on the ballot as not violative of Mass. Const. amend. art. 48, cl. II, &sect; 2, framers of the initiative included language indicating that disbursements to certified candidates would be subject to appropriation. The court held that since the measure had not been repealed by the legislature, and since the legislature lacked unfettered discretion to ignore the clear statutory mandate, the money had to be paid to those who qualified, and sovereign immunity would not bar efforts to collect it. In the instant case, only one of the candidates and voters seeking to compel public officials to release funds was actually certified, so only he was entitled to disbursement. Granting the injunctive relief sought, conditioning 2002 elections on compliance with the law, would have violated separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered relief for the one candidate who qualified for it under the statute, denied the voters the broader relief sought, remanded the matter to the single justice with instruction to dismiss without prejudice, directing that she retain jurisdiction to order relief against the officials as required in the future.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 93A by showing that it had violated the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. The trial court had not erred in admitting evidence of the agency's principal's use of similarly deceptive techniques at other times and in other states to obtain private information, because it was probative to show modus operandi. Finally, the evidence clearly showed that the violation was knowing, so the assessment of a large civil penalty was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The state's highest court concluded that the shop owners failed to produce sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that the theatre was a place of public accommodation on the night in question. Further, the mosque's men's class was engaging in its religious meeting for men only, expressing concern for the community, and discussing the moral ideology and roles of men in addressing crime and violence in the community. The expression of religious viewpoints specific to men of the faith would have been impaired by the inclusion of women in the meeting. The admittance of male members of the public to an otherwise non-public mosque meeting did not bring the event within the scope of the Massachusetts public accommodation law. Holding otherwise would have impermissibly burdened defendants' freedom of association under the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 55, &sect; 14 to reach conduct on government-owned premises primarily used to accommodate private parties and that prisons were occupied by private parties. The supreme judicial court noted that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 55, &sect; 14 was not implicated by mere government-ownership of the building, but depended on the purpose for which the building was occupied. The court held, however, that the occupancy by the inmates and staff was in furtherance of and exclusively for an entirely public purpose. As to the constitutional claims, the court held that the regulation was rationally related to the facilities' goal of maintaining security within the prison. As to the disciplinary sanctions against the individual, the supreme judicial court found substantial evidence to support the sanctions imposed.</SPAN></P>

The photographs appeared to have an artistic quality independent of their specific subject matter. An analysis of the photographs in the context of the Dost factors did not lead to the conclusion that the photographs themselves were lascivious or sufficient evidence of lascivious intent. The photographs (1) did not show sexual behavior or depict a sexually oriented display, (2) were not in a setting generally associated with sexual activity, and (3) did not evince sexual suggestiveness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity. Thus, neither the photographs alone, nor the other evidence on which the Commonwealth relied, demonstrated any lascivious intent by defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations claimed that the Massachusetts tax laws unconstitutionally burdened interstate commerce by treating foreign and domestic corporations, and tangible and intangible property corporations, differently. The commissioner, however, had issued the directive, Mass. Dep't Revenue DD 99-1 (Jan. 4, 1999), stating that taxpayers could choose the formulas they preferred to determine whether the corporation was a tangible or intangible property corporation under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 63, &sect; 30(10), (11), and could calculate the net worth of an intangible property corporation under either Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 63, &sect; 30(8), (9), regardless of their status as a domestic or foreign corporation. The trial court found that the corporations lacked standing to constitutionally challenge the provisions at issue, because the corporations were not harmed by the application of the tax laws. Nonetheless, the trial court considered the corporations' claims, finding that the commissioner's directive erased the effect of any constitutional infirmities that existed in the statutory provisions at issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the medical malpractice action filed by plaintiffs, minor and parents, the Superior Court Department, Suffolk (Massachusetts) entered a judgment granting defendant physician's motion for summary judgment, upholding the constitutionality of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 60D, and rejecting the continuing duty theory.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the minor and the parents argued that: (1) the statute of repose in Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 60D violated the due process and equal protection guarantees of the federal and Massachusetts Constitutions; and (2) the physician was under a continuing duty to treat the minor, such that the action alleging a breach of that duty was still timely, notwithstanding the passage of more than seven years since the minor was actually treated by the physician. The state supreme court held, first, that &sect; 60D bore a reasonable relationship to a legitimate legislative purpose (i.e., to curb the cost of medical malpractice insurance), and that it, therefore, survived the due process challenge. Second, &sect; 60D's distinction between claims based on the leaving of a foreign object in a patient's body and all other claims involved no suspect classification, and &sect; 60D itself did not affect any fundamental right. Thus, &sect; 60D did not deny the minor equal protection. Finally, the physician's promise that he would continue to monitor the minor's rehabilitation and therapy did not mean that he was still continuing to treat the minor after his last visit and final physical therapy session.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the inmate filed an action challenging the constitutionality of Mass.  Gen.

On appeal, the inmate argued the amendments to Mass.  Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court upheld the appellate court's affirmation of conviction, for the reasons stated by the appellate court. However, the highest court addressed defendant's assertion of a violation of her due process rights. Due to the increased sentencing range triggered by a finding that the value of the destroyed property exceeded $ 250, the value of the property had to be treated as an element of the felony of malicious destruction of property, and a value in excess of $ 250 had to be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. There was nothing amiss in the procedure by which defendant's conviction was obtained. The criminal complaint clearly alleged that the value of the property destroyed was over $ 250, and the judge instructed the jury that they had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the property exceeded $ 250. There was no possibility that defendant lacked notice of the charge, or was convicted of anything less than a jury's finding of each element beyond a reasonable doubt.

Although it admitted that such provisions could prove unconstitutional as applied, the high court found no facial invalidity in the scheme. The board could not do its job without gathering preliminary information in as unintrusive a manner as possible, and police always had access to criminal records.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1989 an insurance company was decreed insolvent and a receiver was appointed. At the time there were two conflicting statutes in place which dictated the order in which creditors should be reimbursed. By 2000 the statutes had been reconciled and the receiver relied upon the reconciliation in setting the class priority for payment of claims. Most of the claims were being handled by guaranty funds. There were not sufficient funds to pay all the claims. The appellate court held the statutory revisions made the statutes retroactive regarding the particular case. The claimants could not argue reliance because the insurance industry was regulated. Thus, changes in legislation should have been anticipated. In addition, there was no evidence the claimants relied upon the former liquidation statutes in purchasing insurance from the insolvent insurer. Even if they had, there was no contractual right to a particular distribution where the recovery was statutorily set. Also, any contractual right to recovery was impaired by the insurer's insolvency, not the 2000 amendments.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff did not refute the allegations or demonstrate any justification. The board suspended plaintiff's entertainment license for one day. The board was not a state agency, but, the supreme judicial court determined that the superior court applied the correct standard of review of the board's decision, the substantial evidence test, because of the strong similarity between the nature of the claim in such cases and the revocation of an alcoholic beverage license by the state control commission, to which a substantial evidence test had previously been held by the supreme judicial court to apply under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 30A, &sect; 14(7)(e) of the State Administrative Procedure Act. Section 183A provided authority to modify, suspend, or revoke a license for any violation of the licensing authorities' rules and regulations or for any violation of law, such as an assault.</SPAN></P>

Injuries that fell under &sect; 13J included not only external trauma, but also internal trauma, such as the infant's asphyxiation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant produced several &quot;missing person&quot; flyers identifying and describing a young woman he had dated for three weeks. The young woman had broken up with defendant. Determined to &quot;get back&quot; at her, defendant sneaked into her high school one night and hung the flyers at various locations. The word &quot;missing&quot; was printed in large type across the top of the flyers beneath which was the victim's name and a large photograph of her. Numerous references were made in the flyers about the victim's alleged sexual behaviors. Defendant was convicted under the accosting or annoying provision of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 53. On appeal, defendant argued that neither his acts nor his language was disorderly under &sect; 53. Conviction was affirmed. Though there was no fighting, or violent or tumultuous behavior in the flyer's unaltered photograph and sexualized description of the victim, nor in defendant's conduct in creating or hanging the flyer at the school, the content of the flyer was threatening and therefore constituted disorderly language under the accosting or annoying provision of &sect; 53. Because defendant's language was a true threat, it was not constitutionally protected speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed; the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that defendant's language was threatening and therefore amounted to disorderly language under the applicable criminal statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant retained private counsel in the underlying drug offense prosecution. After suppression of drugs seized from him, the Commonwealth brought an unsuccessful interlocutory appeal as permitted by Mass.  Gen.

The Administrative Office of the Trial Court had exhausted the funds that would normally have been used for defendant's expenses, so the trial court ordered the prosecutor's office to pay them. The court held that this procedure was not unconstitutional. A prosecutor's office was not a subject of Massachusetts for purposes of due process and equal protection principles. The rule as applied also did not violate separation of powers rules by fettering prosecutorial discretion. Costs of interlocutory appeals were simply one more budgetary factor that prosecutors would have had to weigh in requesting funds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the rule as applied did not violate constitutional principles of equal protection or separation of powers; therefore it was appropriate for the district attorney's office that sought the appeal in the underlying action to bear defendant's costs if they were not otherwise covered.</SPAN></P>

The court held that in the specific circumstances of this case the public had a right of access to all of the relevant judicial records. Pursuant to Mass. Sup. Jud. Ct. R. 1:15, Unif. Impoundment &sect; 7, the court balanced the public's right of access to the judicial records at issue against defendant's U.S. Const. amend. VI right to a fair trial and respondent's privacy rights. There was a rigorous presumption of openness as to the judicial records at issue. In contrast, the disclosure of the records would increase only marginally any prejudice already existing against respondent.

The trial court found that disregard of defendants' separate corporate forms was warranted, and ordered the sale of the real estate as well as the home itself. The court affirmed in part, holding that the scope of a court's authority to sell a &quot;facility&quot; under the act was essentially fact specific, depending on the particular ownership interests in the real and personal property possessed by the licensed entity, and the viability of the facility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, 10 registered voters and the state chiefs of police association and state district attorneys, challenged the state attorney general's certification of a voters' initiative petition. The initiative proposed an amendment to the state constitution to tighten the standards under which assets could be forfeited, and to expand the class of individuals permitted to request drug treatment in lieu of prosecution. The court held that the petition was not unconstitutional in any respect. The petition did not authorize any specific appropriation of money from the state treasury, and there was nothing in the petition that would allow &quot;reversal of a judicial decision.&quot; The provisions were sufficiently related to a single, common purpose, to expand the state's drug treatment program. Plaintiffs' concerns about the petition's definition of &quot;drug dependent person&quot; were not reviewable before the legislation was enacted. Finally, the attorney general's summary did not need to provide a comprehensive legal analysis of the measure.</SPAN></P>

A motion to dismiss filed by the defendant Bruno was heard by Charles J. Hely, J. The Supreme Judicial Court granted an application for direct appellate review. Petition filed in the Superior Court Department on October 8, 1999.

The matters were heard by Ireland, J., and the appeals pending in the Appeals Court were ordered consolidated and transferred to this court by him. Petition filed in the Superior Court Department on October 20, 1999. A motion to dismiss filed by the defendant Davila and a motion to stay the defendant's release from commitment were heard by Margot Botsford, J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appeals that were consolidated and ordered transferred by the Massachusetts Appeals Court, plaintiff, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, appealed the trial court order that granted defendant sex offenders' motion to dismiss petitions that sought to commit the defendants civilly as sexually dangerous persons pursuant to Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were separately convicted for sexual offense crimes. During defendants' imprisonment, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts amended Mass. Gen. Law ch. 123A to provide for the civil commitment of a sexually dangerous person. Plaintiff, Commonwealth, filed petitions prior to defendants' scheduled release requesting each be committed as a sexually dangerous person. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the statute could not be applied retroactively. The trial court granted defendants' motion and the Commonwealth filed an appeal. The petitions were consolidated on appeal. Vacating and remanding the orders, which dismissed the petitions, the court held the conduct that triggered the application of ch. 123A was not the defendants' prior conviction of a sexual offense, but the current mental condition of each of the defendants. Further, ch. 123A did not violate the ex post facto law, as the statute was not criminal or penal in nature. The court further vacated the orders that required one of the defendants be held separately and that he receive treatment while under observation, but the court affirmed his commitment for 60 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Orders dismissing defendants' petitions regarding status as a sexually dangerous person were vacated and remanded. Defendants were not determined to be sexually dangerous persons based upon their conviction for sexual crimes but rather on the current mental condition of each of the defendants. Court vacated the orders that one of the defendants was to be held separately and that he receive treatment while under observations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Nonmember public school teachers required to pay agency fees to teachers' association were entitled to limit the use of those fees to activities germane to duties as the collective bargaining representative. They filed charges in 1989 with the Labor Relations Commission alleging the union's use of agency fees for nonchargeable activities. Both the teachers and the union appealed the commission's 1997 decision. The decision was reasonably prompt, under the circumstances. The formula used to calculate the teachers' agency fee properly did not violate their free speech rights by requiring contribution to nonchargeable union activities. Costs to maintain union's existence were chargeable, except where the union specifically identified them as attributable to nonchargeable activity. Expenses for advocating public education funding were political speech, and not chargeable. Informational support services, including an article about communication points during a strike, were chargeable because they were intended to benefit all members of the bargaining unit. Expenses related to withholding services related to a prohibited strike and were, therefore, not chargeable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiff pleaded guilty to two violations of the conflict of interest law, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 268A, &sect; 7, and was ordered to disgorge his profits as restitution, in return for release of all other claims and charges, defendant state Board of Retirement ordered his pension forfeited under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect; 15 (4). The district court affirmed. Plaintiff challenged the ruling, arguing that his settlement agreement with the Attorney General precluded forfeiture and his guilty plea was not a &quot;final conviction&quot; to trigger the pension forfeiture statute. He contended the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him, violated the contract clause, was an excessive fine, and constituted double jeopardy. The appellate court affirmed, rejecting the statutory and constitutional challenges, and remanded to county court for entry of judgment. Plaintiff had a history of public service and was on notice that certain criminal convictions would result in mandatory pension forfeiture under statute. Forfeiture was not disproportionate or excessive but was roughly equivalent to plaintiff's minimum improper gains. &quot;Final conviction&quot; issue was waived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Settlement agreement did not preclude revoking plaintiff's retirement benefits, which was mandatory under pension forfeiture statute, which was not unconstitutional, even assuming forfeiture was punitive &quot;fine,&quot; amount was not excessive, as it approximated value of improper gain. Revocation was not criminal punishment for double jeopardy purposes.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed and raised as error the lack of an actual malice jury instruction. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The court opined that pre-instruction objection was sufficient to preserve claim of improper failure to instruct on actual malice. The court also found that police officers were public officials, given the need for robust debate on police actions, and that as a result, plaintiff was required to prove actual malice (defined as knowledge that an accusation was false or reckless disregard of its falsity). Finally, the court noted that actual malice was also required for emotional distress claim. Accordingly, the verdict was vacated and the case remanded for a retrial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant taxpayer, an out-of-state corporation engaged in retail merchandising, mailed three catalogs each year to Massachusetts residents.

The Commonwealth appealed arguing that the judge relied on the doctrine of collateral estoppel as an incident of due process protection, and the court declines to apply collateral estoppel as a corollary of due process against the Commonwealth through U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved for a new trial, arguing that subsequent court decisions regarding burden-shifting presumptions in jury instructions rendered the trial court's malice instruction erroneous and prejudicial. The trial court denied the motion. The malice instruction shifted the burden of disproving malice to defendant because it required the presumption of malice if the jury found particular facts and the jury would have understood the instruction to limit their consideration to evidence that bore on the circumstances of the killing and to preclude their consideration of any further evidence of defendant's malice. In light of the evidence regarding the nature of the assault on the victim and her resulting injuries, the jury's finding the predicate fact of an unlawful killing was the functional equivalent of their finding the ultimate fact to be presumed, malice. Defendant was not prejudiced because the evidence did not raise a reasonable doubt as to the killer's malice.</SPAN></P>

Further, the contractor's predecessor-in-interest did not clearly establish that it was in &quot;good standing&quot; with relevant state and federal taxing authorities.

He moved to amend his post-appeal motion, renewing his double jeopardy claims and raising new issues. This motion was denied and the new issues deemed waived. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that for crimes of violence against multiple victims the appropriate &quot;unit of prosecution&quot; is the person assaulted or killed, not the underlying criminal act, and that the judicial decision to extend criminal common-law protections to viable fetuses did not offend double jeopardy. Regarding the &quot;new&quot; issues of the amended motion, vagueness of the term viability, viability jury instruction, and defendant's knowledge of viability, the court held these issues were sufficiently developed at the time of the defendant's trial to alert him that viability was a live issue, and trial court properly deemed them waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Senate submitted a question to the court (Massachusetts) requesting the court's opinion on whether a newly proposed bill that restricted access to buffer zones outside reproductive health care facilities violated the constitutional right of freedom of speech or the constitutional right of the people peaceably to assemble.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Senate was concerned about the constitutionality of a proposed bill that created fixed buffer zones of 25 feet from any portion of an entrance, exit, or driveway of a reproductive health care facility, as well as a fixed corridor zone from a clinic entrance to the street. With limited exceptions, the proposed bill prohibited anyone from knowingly entering into or remaining within the buffer zones. The court found a &quot;solemn occasion&quot; existed, which made it proper for it to answer the question regarding constitutionality. The court concluded the proposed bill was a content-neutral statute that was narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. The bill left open ample alternative means of communication. Demonstrators could still protest as they previously had done, but were simply constrained to do so outside the buffer zone. Further, the bill would not violate the right to assemble peaceably under U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was one of 58 vehicles stopped at a drug interdiction roadblock set up in a high crime area of the city. Defendant was the only person arrested for a narcotics offense although there were three arrests and two citations issued. Defendant filed a successful pretrial motion to suppress evidence seized during the roadblock and the Commonwealth filed an interlocutory appeal. At issue was whether the same policy concerns that made sobriety checkpoints reasonable and therefore constitutional also existed with respect to drug interdiction roadblocks. District court held that the roadblock was unconstitutional under the U.S. Const. amend. IV and the Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. XIV. The appellate court agreed, holding that roadblocks set up to search for evidence of contraband, unlike sobriety checkpoints, violated the Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. XIV and were prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order suppressing evidence was affirmed because roadblocks set up to search for evidence of drugs or other contraband violated state law and were prohibited.</SPAN></P>

His statements had been made voluntarily and he had made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights; [3]-There was no Bruton violation because the codefendant's redacted statement did not name expressly, implicate, or obviously refer to the codefendants so as to be &quot;facially&quot; incriminating.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Bristol Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) that civil confined him as a sexually dangerous person pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A; defendant claimed that he did not satisfy the statutory requirements, or, if he did, the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1996, defendant repeatedly targeted a 17-year old for his sexual attentions and subsequent intimidation. In 1999, he used force against a police officer in conjunction with his exhibitionistic act. In the governing offense, defendant entered the victim's apartment and approached her in her bathroom while she was showering, thereby putting her in fear. The trial judge concluded that defendant suffered from a mental abnormality that manifested itself, among other ways, in voyeuristic and exhibitionistic behavior. The judge also found that defendant was likely to reoffend. The appellate court found, inter alia, that as defendant was likely to act on his voyeuristic impulses and exhibitionistic compulsions in the future, he was a menace to the health and safety of others. The significant procedural and substantive requirements in ch. 123A rendered the civil commitment of a menacing sexual offender consistent with the concept of ordered liberty. Accordingly, as defendant's predicted sexual offenses and associated conduct would instill in the victim apprehension of being subjected to a contact sex crime, he was properly committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A friend of the victim observed defendant in a group of three or four youths kicking the victim as he lay on the ground and rising above the victim's body to strike him with a fist. The friend was sufficiently alarmed to tackle defendant, wrestle him to the ground, and hold him until the police arrived notwithstanding punches and kicks directed at him by others in defendant's group. Thus, the evidence sufficed to establish that defendant was one of two or more persons fighting together in a public place, to the terror of persons lawfully there. Also, defendant, the youth in the white sweatshirt, the tall youth with dark skin, and 10 or more others formed together to attack the victim and two of his friends who were lawfully present in a public park. Further, nothing in the legislative definition of affray required the fighting together of two or more person be by agreement or design of all the participants. Thus, because the victim and his two friends were lawfully in the public park, and the attack on them by defendant and his group satisfied the &quot;fighting together of two or more persons&quot; element, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of the offense of affray.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the denial of defendant's suppression motion by the Brockton Division of the Plymouth District Court Department, Massachusetts, defendant appealed his conviction of carrying a firearm without a license under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(a) and possession of a firearm without a firearm identification card (FID card) under &sect; 10(h)(1). He was also convicted of drinking alcohol in public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police stopped defendant with a reasonable suspicion of public consumption of alcohol, but had no subjective intent to arrest him and did not fear for their own safety. The appellate court held that once defendant admitted that he was carrying an object potentially harmful to the inquiring officer, there was an objective basis for a patfrisk under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. XIV. Further, the encounter occurred in an area with a history of firearms violations and defendant was unfamiliar to the officers and was intoxicated. Gomes was distinguished due to the question and answer as to whether defendant was carrying any harmful objects. Defendant's Second Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. II, rights were not violated by the firearm license or FID card requirements as legislation reasonably regulating possession and use of firearms as an exercise of the police power to serve the public health, safety, and welfare was permitted. Defendant lacked standing to challenge the licensure statute as he had not applied for a license or an FID card. The lack of a license or an FID card was an affirmative defense to be proved by defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction by the Hampden Superior Court Department, Massachusetts, of reckless endangerment of a child in violation of Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction. The six-month-old child, his 15-year-old mother, and his father lived with defendant, the child's grandmother. The father dropped the child from above the father's head to a tile floor, and the child struck his head and suffered a complex skull fracture. A doctor testified that left untreated, the child's injuries created a substantial risk of death. Defendant refused to take the mother and the child to the hospital, and confiscated the mother's cell phone to prevent her from summoning an ambulance. Defendant had a duty to act. Delaying or obstructing medical care for the child created a substantial and unjustifiable risk of serious bodily injury. The jury instruction on defendant's duty to act was erroneous, but did not require reversal. The jury was properly instructed that the mother's custody of the child did not absolve defendant of liability. The Commonwealth did not have to prove that medical care would have alleviated a risk. A Ciampa instruction was not required. The notations as to the Department of Social Services's prior involvement in the medical records were not unduly prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the denial of his motion to suppress, defendant was convicted by the Norfolk Superior Court Department, Massachusetts, of possession of an infernal machine (explosive device) under Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the motion to suppress was properly denied. The initial encounter with the police was proper under the community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement.

There had been a previous incident in which defendant had had a physical altercation with police. The TRO judge implicitly found that defendant's presence in the apartment with a gas source presented a clear and immediate danger. The TRO safeguarded defendant's privacy and security against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials for Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. XIV purposes. Defendant's actions created a reasonable suspicion that he was armed, and he was reasonably seized. The firearms and the explosive device were in plain view. The convictions were supported. Section 131L's control requirement as applied did not infringe on defendant's Second Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. II, rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of a firearm without a license (count 1), receiving a firearm with knowledge of its defaced serial number (count 2), assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (count 3), and assault while armed with a firearm and with intent to murder (count 4). Defendant was sentenced to 19-20 year on count 4, 9-10 years on count 3, four years and 11 months to five years on count 1, and one to two years on count 2 to run concurrently with the sentence in count 1. Thereafter, the trial court reduced the period of incarceration in count 4 and substituted a post-release probationary term for the concurrent terms of imprisonment in counts 2 and 3. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the resentencing violated neither a constitutional nor a common-law standard of fairness. Defendant, and not the Commonwealth, proposed the nullification of the existing construct and the creation of the clean slate under Rule 30. The outcome was free of any sign of retaliatory vindictiveness. Consequently, the resentencing did not violate Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 263, &sect; 7 or a common-law standard of fairness.</SPAN></P>

Where a photo of a nude girl on the cusp of puberty showed the direction and curve of her hand toward her exposed pubic area, the over-all design of the visual depiction was to direct the viewer to the girl's developing breasts and pubic area, and the pose could be seen as sexually suggestive, it was determined to be designed to elicit a sexual response and there were no signs that the photograph was other than a lewd exhibition of the girl's breasts and pubic area as the photograph appeared to serve no educational purpose, displayed no obvious artistic sensibilities, and there was no indication that it was commenting in some fashion on other artistic works, the photograph was lewd and its possession was outlawed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a 10-year-old boy (the minor), appealed from a Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) judgment affirming his classification as a level two sex offender which required him to, inter alia, register annually with the Sex Offender Registry Board (SORB) and with the police department pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, &sect; 178K(2)(b). The minor argued, inter alia, that evidence of his history was unreliable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The SORB hearing examiner's decision relied heavily on the contents of the evaluation prepared by the Juvenile Court clinic which contained an extensive factual history regarding the minor and his family, much of it based on layered hearsay. The minor contended that his history should not have been used as a basis for his classification. Whatever basis existed for the SORB's determination that 803 Mass. Code Regs. &sect; 1.40(9)(c)(2) generally enhanced the risk of reoffending, there was no explanation. Each of the five factors used sprung from a conclusion that an offender's choice of a victim's age, sex, or location indicated a greater risk of deviancy and increased the likelihood of reoffense. But a sound application of those factors to derive a true and accurate assessment of an offender's potential for reoffending had to take into account the offender's age. There was no question that the minor was a troubled youngster deeply in need of the services he was receiving. But the classification decision rested on unreliable hearsay and the application without explanation of predictive criteria that did not on their face take account of sexual activity between prepubescent children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. The case was remanded for entry of a judgment vacating the SORB's classification order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Suffolk Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) convicted defendant of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, carrying a firearm without a license, and possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card. In a second trial, another jury convicted defendant of being an armed career criminal based on three predicate offenses, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10G(c) as a sentence enhancement. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that a certified record of conviction was not sufficient evidence that he was convicted of a predicate &quot;violent crime&quot; under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 121, for purposes of the armed career criminal sentencing enhancements of &sect; 10G(a)-(c). The appellate court held that a certified record was sufficient for purposes when the predicate offense was assault and battery on a police officer (ABPO), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 13D, but not when the predicate offense was assault and battery, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 13A(a). The Commonwealth presented no extrinsic evidence to indicate whether the convictions were based on harmful, reckless, or offensive battery. Nor did the Commonwealth present evidence of the underlying facts of defendant's convictions. There was insufficient proof of a harmful or reckless battery conviction, but sufficient proof on the lesser included offense of armed career criminal status based on the two ABPO convictions as predicate offenses. Defendant, having never challenged that his 2003 assault and battery conviction on direct appeal or pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), was not allowed to collaterally attack it here.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment on the armed career criminal enhancement on three predicate violent crimes was reversed, the verdict was set aside insofar as it found that defendant had committed three prior violent crimes, and the matter was remanded for resentencing on the lesser included offense of an armed career criminal enhancement based on two predicate violent crimes. The remaining judgments were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The board claimed that the owner violated the master deed, by-laws, and rules of the condominium, which entitled it to collect expenses from him under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183A, &sect; 6(a)(ii). The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the owner's conduct with regard to the fans, the dog feces, and the fire doors violated the condominium by-laws, rules, and regulations, and that the signs were entitled to First Amendment protection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a civil trial, the Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) found defendant prisoner to be a sexually dangerous person (SDP) as defined in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 1, and committed him to a treatment center for one day to life pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 14(d).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner had previously pled guilty to indecent assault and battery on a child under age fourteen in Massachusetts and second degree child molestation in Rhode Island. The prisoner was later found by a Rhode Island judge to be in violation of probation. His original Rhode Island sentence was imposed. Upon parole, his Massachusetts sentence was imposed. The appellate court held that it could not assume the Department of Correction (DOC) would mechanically adopt the determination by a separate government of the quality of rehabilitation or the quantity of credit attributable to those programs. In the proper exercise of the police power, DOC retained separate sovereign authority and nondelegable responsibility to assess the entitlement and the timing of the release of a recidivist offender into its own population. As of the date of the Commonwealth's submission of a petition under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 12(b), DOC had not exercised its discretionary judgment of his entitlement to sentence credit. That determination was necessary for an entitlement to release before the petition date. He therefore remained a lawful prisoner subject to the process of the SDP statutory scheme.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant watershed district took plaintiff owner's land by eminent domain; plaintiff filed suit under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 79, &sect; 14, for an assessment of damages. After a jury assessed damages, defendant sought a determination that the statutory interest rate should be applied to the award. The Worcester Superior Court (Massachusetts) applied that rate and denied plaintiff's request for compound interest. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury entered its award over 12 years after the taking occurred. Plaintiff argued that the rate and method of calculating interest set by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 79, &sect; 37, did not provided it with just and reasonable compensation as mandated by U.S. Const. amend. V and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. X. The appellate court held that as plaintiff failed to establish that the rate of interest set by ch. 79, &sect; 37, fell substantially below the standard of constitutional reasonableness, it failed to rebut the presumption that the statutory rate met constitutional requirements. By offering only a single comparator, rather than a range or composite of interest rates based on different types of low-risk securities, plaintiff failed to adequately identify what constituted a constitutionally reasonable interest rate. However, given the extended delay between the time of the taking and the time of payment, the compounding of interest was necessary to place plaintiff in as good a position pecuniarily as it would have occupied if the payment had coincided with the appropriation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed suit in the Suffolk Land Court Department (Massachusetts) to quiet title to property on which defendant held a mortgage. Plaintiff alleged the mortgage had been discharged under the &quot;Obsolete Mortgages&quot; statute,&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 260, &sect; 33, because defendant failed to record an extension with the Registry of Deeds as statutorily required. The land court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 33 was ambiguous. However, under the plain language of &sect; 33, the mortgage had been discharged. Section 33 clearly discharged, as matter of law, all mortgages five years after the date on which they became due. The mortgage at issue, clearly within the purview of the statute, expired on August 31, 2001, and was therefore discharged by operation of law on August 31, 2006. The extension agreement did not, contrary to defendant's assertion, extend the maturity date of the mortgage for purposes of &sect; 33 because the extension agreement was never recorded and was therefore not a valid extension under the clear requirements of &sect; 33. Even if the agreement had been recorded, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 260, &sect; 34. Despite defendant's argument that plaintiff lacked good title because the execution which plaintiff acquired the property was dissolved pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 223, &sect; 75, the statute was not applicable because &sect; 75 and Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 223, &sect; 74 concerned attachment of personal property and plaintiff acquired title to the real property following a sheriff's sale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, because his activity was neither offensive nor disorderly, and the evidence only reveled a single act but, given the statutory prohibition of &quot;acts&quot; that accost or annoy, conviction required proof of at least two. The appellate court disagreed, concluding that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's conduct was offensive and disorderly. Within reaching distance of the victim, defendant drew attention to himself, grabbed the genital area of his pants, and moved his hand up and down to mimic masturbation, activity a fact finder could conclude was repugnant to the prevailing sent of what is decent or moral. The appellate court also concluded that, contrary to defendant's claim, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 272, &sect; 53, was not restricted to coverage of situations where a defendant engaged in more than one act, a limitation that would lead to absurd results.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 131L(a) violated the Second Amendment. The appellate court disagreed. The statute did not, on its face, unconstitutionally interfere with an individual's ability to rely on a gun for self-defense, and nothing suggested that its requirements interfered with defendant's right to self-defense. The Commonwealth met its burden of proving that the gun was not under defendant's control. The gun was stored in the pocket of a jacket hanging in an upstairs closet. Defendant was downstairs. The gun was out of its holster, which was lying on the kitchen floor. Children were present, including a boy who at times was closer to the gun than was defendant. The jury had sufficient evidence to find that the gun was not within defendant's control. Defendant argued that the admission of a child's statement violated his right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment. However, nothing suggested that the statement was made for any purpose other than to secure aid, let alone that the child had in mind that the statement would or could be used to prove some fact at a future criminal trial. The statement, thus, was not testimonial for Sixth Amendment purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said insufficient evidence supported his ammunition possession conviction, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(h). The appellate court disagreed because (1) it showed constructive possession, (2) it showed the ammunition was designed for use in any firearm, and (3) he showed no valid firearms identification card. Evidence of his unlicensed gun possession was sufficient because (1) it showed constructive possession, (2) he showed no license, (3) it showed the gun met the definition in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 121, and (4) it showed he and the gun were not found at his home or business. Cocaine possession evidence was insufficient because nothing showed he knew it was present. Admitting a ballistics certificate without live testimony was not harmless as to the gun but was harmless as to the ammunition, because (1) nothing else showed the gun was operable, but (2) the ammunition was identifiable without scientific testing. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(h) did not violate the Second Amendment because (1) defendant did not live where he and the gun were found, and (2) his criminal history barred compliance with valid licensing rules in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 131(d)(i).</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that stopping defendant solely for violating &sect; 2.23(3) was illegal because that regulation exceeded the scope of the enabling statute. The appellate court disagreed with this rationale, because evidence obtained after a stop based on an illegal regulation would be admissible. However, &sect; 2.23(3) only related to license plate frames, not &quot;stripes,&quot; and thus could not form a basis for the stop.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nieces and nephews of a decedent brought an action against defendant daughter, seeking a declaration that the daughter was not the decedent's child and, thus, that she was not an heir and may not have inherited from his estate. The Suffolk Division of the Probate and Family Court Department (Massachusetts) found that the daughter was the decedent's child and granted her summary judgment motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter was born before the decedent's marriage. The appellate court found that, although record included evidence indicating that the daughter was not the decedent's child, the father had completed an affidavit in 1944, and based on this affidavit, the daughter's record of birth was filed. The daughter's certified birth certificate stated that her father was the decedent. Once the decedent acknowledged the daughter as his child, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 190, &sect; 7, she was his child and heir, just as if she had been born in wedlock. That the decedent later did not consistently assert that the daughter was his child did not draw the sufficiency of his acknowledgment itself into question. None of the evidence in the record raised a genuine issue about whether the decedent's signature on the affidavit was knowing and voluntary. The text of &sect; 7 provided no basis for allowing other relatives greater authority to challenge the biological relationship to his or her intestate father of a child born out of wedlock and acknowledged under the statute than would be permitted with respect to a child born during the marriage of that father.</SPAN></P>

The court resolved petitioner's appeal on the basis of statutory construction rather than the constitutional questions. In a prior decision, the court found that a &quot;report&quot; by a non-QE psychiatrist offered in evidence by the Commonwealth was a psychiatric or psychological record within the meaning of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 123A, &sect; 14(c), and was therefore admissible just as QE reports were. The provision of &sect; 14(c) was essentially identical to the provision of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 123A, &sect; 9. Therefore, &sect; 9 required the admission of petitioner's experts' reports on the same basis as those of the QEs. The error in excluding the written reports of petitioner's experts was prejudicial because only the reports by the QEs were sent with the jury into the jury room, giving them a weight and accessibility during deliberations that petitioner's evidence did not have.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While testifying, defendant suggested that at the time of the search, he did not know what a shell casing was. In response to this testimony, the Commonwealth was permitted to question defendant about whether he had previously been on probation as a juvenile for possession of ammunition. Defendant argued that this was improper because there was no certified record of the conviction as required by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 21. However, the appellate court held that this was not a case where the Commonwealth was trying to impeach defendant by proof of his commission or conviction of a crime and thus Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 21 did not apply. The method of impeachment by contradiction was proper. The &quot;shell casings&quot; found in defendant's room were &quot;cartridge cases&quot; within the meaning of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(h). There was no ambiguity which would have invalidated Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(h) under the void-for-vagueness doctrine. Further, the statute bore a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective and did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant responded affirmatively when he was asked, during a well-being check based on defendant's suicide threat, that he had a gun in a cooler located outside. Inside the cooler, the officers found a locked box in which there was a firearm. The box was composed of a plastic-type material and measured approximately 10-by-6 inches. The box was designed with a small hole, which lined up with the firearm's trigger guard. The box was found with a cable lock threaded through the hole, thereby securing the firearm in the box as well as locking the box itself. The appellate court held that defendant did not violate &sect; 131L(a) because the statute permitted the storage of a firearm in any place as long as it was secured in a locked container. The word &quot;secured&quot; indicated that the container had to not merely be locked, but securely locked in a way that would deter all but the most persistent from gaining access. The fact that defendant placed the securely locked box in a cooler was of no consequence. Neither the statute nor Massachusetts case law required a gun owner who kept a firearm secured in a locked container to also store that container in a secure location.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff fishermen filed an action against defendant director of the division of marine fisheries, challenging 322 Mass. Code Regs. 7.01(4)(a) (2006), as unconstitutional, and as illegal, arbitrary, and capricious under Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 30A. The Plymouth Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) ordered that summary judgment enter for the director. The fishermen appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the challenged regulation, the fishermen were allowed to fish in state waters, but only in accordance with their federal permits, unless they surrendered their federal permits and fished in accordance with their state permits. Prior to the adoption of the regulation, the fishermen avoided federal restrictions by postponing the annual renewal of the federal permits and, in the interim, fishing in state waters under their state permits. Contrary to the fishermen's claims, the state regulation was not preempted by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1801 et seq., which expressly provided for the state's regulatory authority over Massachusetts coastal waters. The appeals court also found no dormant commerce clause violation, concluding that limiting the fishermen to either the state or federal programs as a remedy for over fishing was a legitimate use of state police power to conserve resources. There was no equal protection violation either, as the regulation was enacted to address overfishing in Massachusetts coastal waters and the adverse effect of fishers taking advantage of the loophole between the federal and state permitting schemes.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the Commonwealth argued that the motion judge erred in granting the motion to suppress, because the officer reasonably believed that defendant was a Massachusetts residence driving without a license and thus, had probable cause to arrest him. The court concluded that because the police officer reasonably believed that defendant was a resident of Massachusetts and needed a Massachusetts driver's license to drive there, probable cause to arrest for a violation of operating a motor vehicle without a license existed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Cambridge Division of the District Court Department (Massachusetts) convicted defendant of malicious destruction of property with a value less than $ 250, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &sect; 127, and intimidation of a witness, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268, &sect; 13B(1). After the verdict was returned, the trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss and motion for mistrial. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that, the day before trial, the uncle of a Commonwealth witness, a police detective, had made threats to him which made him afraid to testify. The detective did not deny that the encounter took place, but contradicted defendant's version of it. The trial judge stated that she did not credit defendant's testimony that his interaction with the detective made him too fearful to testify. The appellate court found that the incident amounted to the sort of egregious misconduct that had provided a basis for remedial action in prior cases. Mere disbelief of defendant did not satisfy the Commonwealth's burden of showing that no interference actually occurred. However, the evidence supported a finding that the incident did not cause defendant to forgo his right to testify. Although defendant moved for a mistrial, no trial activity goaded him into doing so. Further, the Commonwealth showed that a fair trial was still possible. However, defendant's version of events showed misconduct so grossly improper that dismissal might have been appropriate even in the absence of prejudice. Further findings were essential to a proper disposition of defendant's motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders denying defendant's motion for a mistrial and his motion to dismiss were vacated. The case was remanded for reconsideration, first, of the motion for a mistrial. If the mistrial motion was allowed, then the trial court was to reconsider the motion to dismiss. In either case, and without limitation, express findings on the content of the conversation between defendant and the detective during their encounter were essential.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a pretrial motion in limine, the Commonwealth contended that even though the complainant's neighbor was the first individual to whom she reported that she had been raped, another witness, the investigating officer who responded when the neighbor called the police, should have been substituted as the Commonwealth's designated first complaint witness. Over defendant's objection, the trial court allowed the officer to testify as the designated first complaint witness, on the ground that the officer had spoken with the complainant only a short time after she spoke with her neighbor, and had heard more details of the incident. The Commonwealth was not entitled to substitute a more detailed subsequent complaint merely because it strengthened the Commonwealth's case. The testimony of the complainant's neighbor was that the complainant reported having been sexually assaulted. The testimony plainly qualified as first complaint, and there was no evidence to suggest the neighbor was incompetent or biased. Indeed, her testimony closely matched what the complainant remembered telling her. The officer's more detailed testimony could have influenced the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first challenged the denial of his motion to dismiss the school zone charge on the basis that there was insufficient evidence presented to the grand jury to prove that his possession of cocaine with intent to distribute occurred within 1,000 feet of a school. The Commonwealth concluded that the evidence was sufficient for the purposes of grand jury proceedings, as the references to 1381 Main Street in the exchange between the prosecutor and the detective should have been understood to refer to 1380 Main Street, the location where defendant was arrested. Defendant also claimed that statements he made to a detective while in custody should have been suppressed because they were the result of an interrogation or the functional equivalent thereof. The appellate court disagreed, finding that whether defendant had any money for his children was not a an interrogation question or one that was likely to elicit an incriminating response. The appellate court also concluded, inter alia, that the admission of five certificates of analysis without testimony from the analyst violated defendant's right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Suffolk Superior Court (Massachusetts) convicted defendant of armed home invasion under Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 265, &sect; 18C, armed assault with intent to murder under Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 265, &sect; 18(b), and unlawful possession of a firearm under Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 269, &sect; 10(a). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that there was insufficient evidence of his guilt for home invasion because the indictment only charged one of the two alternate ways of proving the crime, specifically, that he entered the dwelling without knowledge of anyone inside. Therefore, he argued the Commonwealth could only prove home invasion by showing he had no knowledge of occupants in the dwelling. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the statute contained an element with alternative scienter clauses, not two separate offenses. The indictment merged the two scienter elements into one without affecting what the Commonwealth had to prove; namely, that prior to assaulting the occupant defendant knew or should have known of the occupant's presence. The appellate court also found that the Commonwealth provided sufficient evidence defendant entered the dwelling when his foot crossed the threshold of the door and when the gun was inserted into the apartment. The appellate court found that the victim's description of the gun as 11 or 12 inches in length was sufficient for the judge to deny defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty on the firearm charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of rape of a child, indecent assault and battery on a person who has attained the age of 14, and unnatural and lascivious acts with a child under the age of 16. Defendant was sentenced to 20 years for rape. Defendant's convictions were affirmed on direct appeal. Thirteen years later, defendant filed a motion for a new trial. The Dukes County Superior Court (Massachusetts) denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court first concluded that because defendant had a direct appeal in which he raised none of the claims he asserted, his substantive claims, except for that involving the right to a public trial, were waived for appellate review. The appellate court also noted that a fresh complaint instruction was not mandatory, that the jury instructions adequately and clearly defied the limited use the jurors could make of the fresh complaint testimony, and the victim did not self-corroborate. Because there was nothing, save multiple layers of speculation, to support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, no hearing was required on those claims. Finally, the appellate court found that, on the face of it, the order the close the courtroom was improper. The judge was not required to close the courtroom simply because the victim was under 18. The interests to be protected by the closure were not addressed and did not obviously emerge from the record. The appellate court concluded that a hearing was required to consider, inter alia, whether the courtroom was closed, whether counsel had a sound reason for declining to object, and whether defendant agreed to the closure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the motion for a new trial was vacated and the case was remanded for a hearing on defendant's public trial claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Bristol Superior Court (Massachusetts) entered a judgment for plaintiff building owner on jury verdicts of negligence and civil rights violations after he sued defendant city pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258, &sect; 2 and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claiming that the city unlawfully demolished two buildings he owned. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building owner obtained two buildings from the previous owner. Thereafter, the city targeted them for demolition. It notified the previous owner by certified mail of its intentions. The letter was returned undelivered. At the time, the buildings were uninhabitable. A representative for the building owner sent a letter to the city's building commissioner describing the building owner's intent to rehabilitate and requesting that the buildings not be demolished. She then submitted a structural report the city requested. The buildings were soon demolished anyway. The building owner then sued alleging negligence and the violation of his civil rights. A jury found for him under both theories. The appellate court found that sufficient evidence supported a finding of negligence by the city in demolishing the two buildings, but also determined that since the buildings were uninhabitable, the correct measure of negligence damages was diminution in value, not loss of use. It also found that the building owner could not prove its 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims because he did not show that the city's building commissioner was a policy maker whose single decision could bind the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the judgment as to liability on the negligence claims, vacated that judgment as to damages, and remanded the case to the trial court for a reassessment of damages on those claims. The appellate court also reversed the judgment, as to both liability and damages, on the civil rights claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Commonwealth Employment Relations Board filed a complaint for contempt against defendant teachers union. The union challenged a judgment of the Superior Court, Suffolk (Massachusetts), which imposed a prospective coercive fine against the union after ruling that it was in contempt of a previous order that enjoined it from engaging in, threatening, or encouraging a strike or work stoppage in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 150E, &sect; 9A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A school committee anticipated that union members would authorize a strike. It petitioned the Board to initiate an investigation pursuant to &sect; 9A(b). The Board found that the union's actions were reasonably construed as constituting inducement or encouragement of a strike or work stoppage in violation of &sect; 9A(a) and that a strike was about to occur. It issued an order requiring the union to rescind and disavow its motion for a strike veto. The union failed to comply with the Board's order. The Board filed a complaint in the superior court, seeking enforcement of its order. The superior court found that the union had engaged in prohibited &sect; 9A(a) activities. The union argued that the Board improperly concluded that a strike was about to occur. The appeals court held that the evidence amply supported the Board's conclusion that the union violated &sect; 9A(a) by encouraging and inducing a strike. A reasonable inference that the union was involved in encouraging a strike was warranted, if not compelled, by all of the evidence. The Board had a substantial interest in preventing a strike by the union members, and any incidental limitation of First Amendment freedoms was justified.</SPAN></P>

The charges were continued without a finding for six months, and were then dismissed on recommendation of the probation department. Defendant's motion for a new trial was denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the case was not moot as the continuance without a finding was counted as a sentence for purposes of calculating criminal history points in federal sentencing. If defendant's appeal was successful, he could petition for resentencing within one year of his sentencing. Defendant had a continuing personal stake in the outcome of the litigation. The colloquy did not explain to defendant the elements of the crime, nor did counsel represent that the elements of the crime had been explained to defendant. The facts as recited by the prosecutor did not allege that defendant himself sprayed or applied paint or placed a sticker upon anything. He could only have been liable as a joint venturer. The facts did not convey that defendant shared a  principal's intent to commit the crime or that defendant had reached agreement with the principal to aid in its commission. Therefore the recitation of facts did not adequately inform defendant that intent and agreement were essential elements of joint venture liability for the crime. Nothing in the colloquy explained the requisite intent or the agreement essential for defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the motion for a new trial seeking to withdraw defendant's admission to sufficient facts was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that &sect; 29B did not contain two separate crimes. Both types of content were depicted in the more than 900 images defendant possessed, and there was no violation of Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. XII or the federal constitution. No double jeopardy violation arose from the choice to group the images according to the media upon which they were stored. The improper admission of prior bad act evidence was not prejudicial. Trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to file a suppression motion that was likely futile. Defendant claimed that he had a low IQ, but said that he understood the Miranda warnings, and showed computer literacy and proficiency sufficient to permit him to navigate the Internet, download photographs, use software to erase incriminating materials, communicate by email, trade materials with other Internet users, purchase and return computer equipment, and display a level of sophistication about the capabilities of his computer equipment, software, and printers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Suffolk County Superior Court (Massachusetts), which denied defendant's motion for a new trial as to his convictions for armed assault in a dwelling under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 18A; assault by means of a dangerous weapon under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 15B(b); and unlawful possession of a firearm under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the Commonwealth had not established the essential elements of armed assault in a dwelling and that his pretrial motion to suppress evidence was improperly denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. While defendant waived the issues as he did not pursue them on direct appeal, the court reviewed them to determine whether any error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. An entry occurred within the meaning of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 18A because while defendant was outside the apartment, the gun he used to threaten the victim crossed the plane of the doorway, which was missing its top screen, into the dwelling. About an hour after the victim spoke to the police, the police received a call that a man in a local bar had a firearm. The police arrived in a marked cruiser with its blue lights flashing. The police did not stop defendant in the bar without reasonable suspicion before he reached for his waist after being asked if he possessed a firearm because the use of the blue lights on the cruiser was prior to the police's arrival at the bar and did not convert the officers' exploratory questioning of defendant into a stop.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of the motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 14, defendant moved to suppress evidence seized from his home. The Suffolk Superior Court (Massachusetts) denied the motion, and defendant was convicted on 14 indictments related to the illegal and unlicensed possession of firearms. He appealed his convictions and the sentence imposed under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(m), for possession of large capacity feeding devices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A 911 caller reported that an elderly woman was trembling and asking for help. An officer was directed to the woman's home. The front door was locked; firefighters forced it open. While searching for the woman, officers entered a bedroom where they saw in plain view two handguns, one with a silencer. Other guns and ammunition were in plain view in the home. Defendant returned home with his elderly mother, who was shaking and disoriented. There were large capacity feeding devices for which defendant had no license; one of the guns had a defaced serial number and another was listed as stolen. The appellate court held the officers' entry into the home and bedroom was permissible under the &quot;emergency exception&quot; to the warrant requirement, as the purpose of the search was to protect life and not to gather evidence of criminal activity. That the prosecution failed to turn over a police report for a year, and that a witness whose address was in the report had moved and could not be located, did not entitle defendant to relief, as he did not show the witness's testimony would have helped him. Section &sect; 10(m) required the trial court to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 2 1/2 years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensed funeral director contended that the burial permit charges levied by the cities were improper taxes. The charges were imposed to obtain burial permits to meet the Commonwealth's Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 114, &sect; 43M requirement of disposing of dead bodies. The trial court determined from the evidence that the cities incurred significant costs in issuing burial permits. It then found that the licensed funeral director had not shown the charges were taxes. The appellate court determined that distinguishing between a tax and a fee involved application of the three-part Emerson College test. It noted that a legitimate fee was (1) charged for a  government service to benefit a particular party, (2) paid voluntarily, and (3) collected to compensate the government entity. It then found that the burial permit charge was collected to compensate the cities, but that there was no question that the issuance of the permits had shared public benefits and that the services were provided involuntarily. It concluded that the third factor weighing in favor of the cities imposing a valid fee was not enough to overcome the weight of the first two factors indicating that the charges were taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supervisor was in charge of the office where the employee worked. The appellate court held enough evidence showed he sexually harassed the employee, based on his sexually suggestive comments and actions, which were objectively offensive and severe and pervasive enough to support a finding of harassment and ensuing emotional distress damages. The employer was vicariously liable for his sexual harassment and for compensatory damages. Judgment notwithstanding the verdict was proper as to the employee's lost income award because she resigned and did not show constructive discharge, as she was transferred to another office, and no adverse action was taken against her. The investigation of her complaint did not show intolerable working conditions, especially since she did not participate after making her complaint. The supervisor's conduct supported a punitive damages award against him, and their amount was not excessive. The evidence did not show the employer inadequately or inappropriately investigated the matter, so its direct liability was not shown, and there was no factual predicate for awarding punitive damages against it directly.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 6, &sect;&sect; 178C - 178P, and that he was not required to register as a sex offender. On appeal, the court found that the jury could have rationally concluded that (1) defendant's conviction in New York constituted a sex offense under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, &sect; 178C; (2) the New York statute under which defendant was convicted was sufficiently like the prohibition in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 13H for indecent assault and battery on a person over 14; (3) defendant was a resident of Massachusetts; and (4) defendant knowingly failed to register. In addition, the trial judge properly instructed the jury. Finally, the Sex Offender Registration Statute was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant as his constitutional right to travel under the Privileges and Immunities Clause was not violated and his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment was not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, after a jury-waived trial in the Peabody Division of the Essex District Court Department (Massachusetts), of negligently operating a motor vehicle in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24(2)(a). The charge resulted from an incident involving defendant's operation of a motor vehicle in a shopping center parking lot. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. Specifically, defendant challenged the element of negligent operation so as to endanger the lives and safety of the public. The appellate court found that the incident occurred in the middle of the day, in a busy shopping center parking lot with &quot;moderate to heavy&quot; vehicle and pedestrian traffic, and on a surface that had recently been subject to large amounts of snow. The evidence of defendant's behavior, when viewed in relation to the attendant circumstances, was sufficient to prove that his conduct might have endangered the lives of the public. The lack of evidence of continuing excessive speed was only one factor to be considered when determining whether the lives of the public could have been endangered. The evidence was sufficient to withstand a motion for a required finding of not guilty. Defendant's argument that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24(2)(a) was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to give fair warning of the proscribed conduct and was subject to arbitrary application was not entitled to consideration because it was raised for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lead paint victim filed suit against defendant, an attorney's secretary, individually and as trustee and against defendant co-trustees, individually and as trustees, alleging violations of the lead poisoning prevention act, warranty of habitability, and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, &sect; 14. The secretary filed a third-party complaint for indemnification against the estate of the attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Northeast Division of the Housing Court Department, Essex (Massachusetts), granted the secretary's summary judgment motion. The victim appealed. The appellate court held that the adoption of a statutory definition of &quot;owner&quot; after the cause of action accrued was not necessarily retroactive. Further, the secretary was not an owner under the new definition. The attorney and the co-trustees intended for title to the building to be held in a nominee trust. The secretary did not exercise authority with respect to the trust property, and did not receive any benefits as a result of her position. However, the trust instrument used was not normally used to create a nominee trust. The instrument was enforced to reflect the parties' intentions. Thus, the secretary was a nominee trustee and was not exposed to liability under the lead poisoning statute. The victim's claim that the secretary was an &quot;owner&quot; who had control of the premises under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, &sect;&nbsp;189A(ii) was also rejected. The purported authorization to allow the trustees to act as if the property was theirs was of little consequence as the co-trustees had to agree to any expenditure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the trial court (Massachusetts) that convicted him of indecent assault and battery on a mentally retarded person under Mass. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant drove the victim, a mentally retarded person, to a motel. Once in the room, he repeatedly told her to take off her clothes; she eventually complied because she was scared. Defendant picked her up and put her on the bed, and, inter alia, told her to &quot;play with herself,&quot; and she complied because she was scared. The appellate court found that &sect; 13F did not proscribe only forced offensive touchings in which the perpetrator directly engaged in &quot;sexual contact&quot; that caused the offensive touching. In addition, the statute as applied was not unconstitutionally vague. Consent was the focus of the defense, and was an issue referred to in the opening statements and closing arguments of both counsel. Therefore, even though defendant did not object, the trial judge's failure to give a lack of consent instruction for the assault and battery counts was erroneous. Defendant was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners one and two filed suits seeking the reversal of a conditional exclusion from a designated port area (DPA) of two other properties.

The Suffolk Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) denied property owner one's and two's motions for summary judgment and the trustee's motion for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court allowed the cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment of defendants, including the Director of the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (OCZM). Property owners one and two, the trustee, and intervenor legal foundation appealed. The appellate court held that the Director did not have discretion to exclude otherwise includable property from the regulatory framework. Further, the Director's decision was not supported by substantial evidence. There was no evidence that the industrial roadway deemed important enough by the Director to exclude otherwise suitable properties from the DPA would ever be constructed, for want of financing, in the reasonably near, or even in the remote, future. There was, however, substantial evidence supporting the decision to continue property three's inclusion in the DPA. The trustee's claim that his due process rights were violated by the OCZM's failure to include him in the negotiations that led to the exclusion of the two other properties was correctly rejected. Finally, the continued inclusion of property three within the DPA did not constitute an unconstitutional regulatory taking.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court agreed with defendant, finding that defendant was not shown that have gained knowledge of that duty until the day after the date of the offense listed on the complaint. Since the complaint alleged that defendant's failure was a continuing offense, the time period specified in the complaint was an integral part of the crime, to be proven by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth further failed to prove that the newspaper notices were seen by defendant. Defendant also argued that the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence to prove that his conduct was disorderly, as required for a conviction for accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 53. The appellate court agreed, finding that it was not reasonable to infer that defendant intended the victim to fear that harm would befall her and that there was no aggressive or invasive move by defendant toward the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed for the first time on appeal that the statutory scheme was inapplicable to him as a sexually dangerous person who, he asserted, was indigent, and, in any event, unconstitutionally denied him due process and equal protection. The appellate court found that the inmate's appeal was not properly before it. Even granting the inmate the three days' grace afforded by Mass. R.Civ.P. 6(d), his notice of appeal was untimely. There was, thus, no pending appeal, much less any outstanding ruling, to which the inmate's motion for reconsideration could relate or attach. The arguments in the inmate's motion for reconsideration were predicated on his asserted &quot;indigency,&quot; which status he never actually established and which appeared to be contrary to the definitions of &quot;indigent&quot; and &quot;inmate&quot; in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. &sect;&sect; 27A, 29. Therefore, the single justice properly denied both the inmate's Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 261, &sect; 27B motion for waiver of the Mass. Gen.

The Superior Court, Norfolk (Massachusetts) then allowed the board's motion for judgment on the pleadings in the employee's action in the nature or certiorari. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, who was employed as a city inspector, entered pleas of guilty on indictments charging him with violations of Mass.

Laws ch. 266, &sect; 20 (stealing personnel records). The board held that the convictions involved violations of laws applicable to the employee's position thereby resulting in forfeiture of the employee's retirement allowance pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect;&nbsp;15(4). The court agreed that there were multiple, direct links between the criminal offenses and the employee's position because the employee removed documents from his personnel file that criticized his job performance in order to improve his chances of being reappointed. However, even though the employee did not raise his Eighth Amendment &quot;excessive fine&quot; challenge before the board, the issue was not waived because the board clearly had no jurisdiction to decide the constitutionality of the forfeiture provision as applied to the employee and the fact finding required to resolve the Eighth Amendment issue did not involve specialized expertise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the superior court's judgment and remanded the case to the district court for consideration of the employee's Eighth Amendment claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, over a two-year period, occasionally was a babysitter for the two complainants, two girls under the age of 14, because he knew their parents.

The director contacted the mother, who confirmed defendant's conduct by talking to each complainant separately. Following a trial, defendant was convicted by a jury of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of 14 in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 13B. On appeal, he asserted that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a finding that he touched the complainants in an &quot;indecent&quot; way, or that he touched them during the relevant time period. In a related argument, he contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. The appellate court found that the evidence sufficiently supported a finding of &quot;indecency,&quot; that alleging the exact time he indecently touched them was not an element of the offense, and that the statute sufficiently informed him of the kind of conduct that was improper.</SPAN></P>

The inmate also sought statutory good time in connection with the sentence regarding the crimes committed while in jail, which was denied him on the basis of his having committed the crimes during a term of imprisonment. The court agreed that a prisoner should not be penalized or burdened by denial of credit when the prisoner has served time under a sentence that was reversed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Northampton Division of the District Court Department (Massachusetts) convicted defendant under Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that on its face the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague unless the offense of unlawful assembly was qualified by the additional statutory terms &quot;riotous or tumultuous.&quot; The appellate court initially found that defendant based his argument on decisional law interpreting a related but separate offense which was not determinative of the offense in question. Defendant also improperly assumed that only the crime of riot was encompassed within Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2. Although riot was among the offenses included, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 2, referred to &quot;rioters or persons unlawfully assembled.&quot; The use of the disjunctive &quot;or&quot; supported the conclusion that unlawful assembly was a separate offense. The appellate court held that the statute was not unconstitutional on its face because an essential element of the terms &quot;riot&quot; and &quot;unlawful assembly&quot; was the intent to commit an act of violence. Only peaceful assemblies were protected by the First Amendment. Because the statute was constitutional, and no transcript of the trial was submitted to determine the basis on which defendant was convicted, the judgment had to be affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a Medicaid reimbursements dispute, the Superior Court Department, Massachusetts, granted plaintiff hospital's motion for judgment on the pleadings to vacate a decision of the Commissioner of the Division of Medical Assistance, Massachusetts. The Division, which had initially denied reimbursement, appealed from the superior court's judgment. At issue was whether the services were medically necessary under 130 Mass. Code Regs. &sect; 450.204 (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital sought reimbursement for inpatient services provided to three Medicaid patients. The Division denied the request, even though the services were medically appropriate under &sect; 450.204, because they should have been provided in an outpatient setting. Thus, the services were ruled not &quot;medically necessary.&quot; In disputing the denial, the hospital had argued that the Division's regulations violated due process because they did not give the hospital sufficient guidance for determining when a patient admission was proper. Reversing, the appeals court ruled that &sect; 450.204 and the other regulations were not vague under the Fourteenth Amendment; the hospital did not have to guess at their meaning, and they did not set a standard that could not be ascertained. The court identified several other regulations and guidelines that gave definition to the meaning of &quot;medically necessary,&quot; including 130 Mass. Code Regs. &sect; 415.414(C), which gave factors and specific examples. The court also ruled that the regulations did not violate the federal mandate in 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396a(a)(30)(A) with regard to economy of care. The regulatory scheme was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the superior court for a determination of whether there was substantial evidence to support the Division's decision in the three cases.</SPAN></P>

The Suffolk Superior Court (Massachusetts) permanently enjoined defendants from enforcing adult entertainment ordinances against the corporation and ordered that defendants pay attorney's fees and costs of $915,027. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the ordinances violated the First Amendment and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 16. It found that because they effectively removed all possibility that the corporation could operate within the city, they could not be justified as a permissible time, place, and manner restriction. Furthermore, it found that, because the ordinances effectively banned protected speech, they operated as an impermissible prior restraint. The court held that in finding that the ordinances left no reasonable alternative sites for the corporation to operate its business on, the trial court properly credited the testimony of the corporation's land use experts. Next, the fee award under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &sect; 11I, which included a request for fees of $500,000 for a trial that lasted less than four days and which did not separate the rate awarded to lead counsel from the rates awarded to others, was excessive. Furthermore, expert witness fees were improperly awarded under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act because the evidence did not warrant a finding in the corporation's favor under the Act. There was no evidence of threats, intimidation, or coercion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the permanent injunction. It vacated the award of attorney's fees and costs and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after midnight, police officers in an unmarked automobile in a high crime area observed defendant walking along a sidewalk with his right arm rigid, not moving, and pressed to his side as if he were holding something. The officers approached defendant and asked him some questions. Defendant continued to shield his right side from their view. Believing that defendant's jacket contained a firearm, one of the officers told him that he intended to conduct a pat frisk. When defendant moved back to avoid being frisked, the officer grabbed defendant's right jacket pocket and felt the handle of a handgun. He reached into defendant's pocket and seized the gun. The appellate court found that the manner of defendant's walk, even in conjunction with the other factors, did not provide an objective factual basis for a reasonable suspicion that he was engaged in criminal activity. Consequently, the search violated U.S. Const. ament. IV and Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution&nbsp;Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 14.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had lived with his girlfriend in the apartment for some time. When the couple broke up, defendant moved out. The parties continued to see each other sporadically, and defendant spent some nights at the apartment. On the night in question, defendant broke into a back door and came into the residence without the girlfriend's permission. When defendant found the victim, another man, in the residence, he shot and killed the victim. Defendant argued on appeal that the prosecution failed to prove the first element of the crime of home invasion, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 18C, that defendant knowingly entered the dwelling place of another. Defendant argued that the apartment partially belonged to him, and thus remained his dwelling place. The appellate court held that the term &quot;dwelling place of another&quot; referred to occupancy, not ownership interests. Defendant did not occupy the apartment at the time of the crime, as he had moved out. His visits with the girlfriend did not constitute continued occupancy. Thus, the conviction was proper. However, the court found that the sentence imposed was illegal and had to be vacated.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court concluded that defendant's hospital records were generally admissible under Mass. Gen.

However, in light of qualifying language in a preliminary toxicology report, it was not sufficiently reliable to be admitted under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 79. But, the erroneous admission of that report did not require reversal because the evidence of alcohol intoxication was overwhelming. In addition, the statements in the hospital records were not testimonial in fact and did not violate the Confrontation Clause because the challenged notations appear to have been made within hours or a day after his admission and were related to evaluating his condition at the time of his admission in order to determine appropriate treatment. The notations were not made in anticipation of their use in the investigation and prosecution of a crime. Crawford did not render Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 79&nbsp;unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town appealed a judgment by the Suffolk Land Court Department (Massachusetts) that reversed a decision by defendant zoning board of appeals, and ruled that the application of a provision in the zoning by-laws was unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff owner; the town claimed that the owner was not injured by application of the by-laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner obtained approval in 1997 to subdivide a tract containing approximately 22 acres into four separate lots, including the 8.1-acre locus. The local zoning by-laws provided that the minimum street frontage was 250 feet. The locus had frontage of only 100 feet, but the owner was able to build a single family home on the locus by taking advantage of a &quot;frontage exception for larger lots&quot; in the zoning by-laws. Thereafter, the owner sought to convey a two-acre portion of the locus to become part of an adjoining lot, which was owned by the trustee, its president. The owner sought a variance under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &sect; 10 from the frontage exception provision in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 240, &sect; 14A. The appellate court held that the owner failed to show significant injury to its interest in the locus, i.e., that the prohibition against conveying out the two-acre parcel was arbitrary, unreasonable, and oppressive. The relief allowed by the Land Court undermined the uniform application of otherwise valid local zoning. The owner's goal could be accomplished without such invalidation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated insofar as it declared the by-law invalid as applied, and a new judgment was entered declaring that the provision was valid as applied; the remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hit a victim's jaw. The blow broke the jaw and required the victim to be fed through a tube for six weeks pending his recovery. Defendant contended that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 13A required that any impairment of bodily function be permanent in order to constitute a serious bodily injury. The court rejected defendant's argument and determined that loss or impairment of a bodily function did not need to be permanent to meet the definition of &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; under the statute. A construction that applied &quot;permanent&quot; to modify only &quot;disfigurement&quot; was the most natural and sensible reading of the sentence structure in the statutory definition. The overall statutory scheme, defining increasingly aggravated forms of assault and battery, with concomitantly increasing penalties, also supported the court's interpretation. Also, it would have been anomalous if a greater injury were required to prove assault and battery causing serious bodily injury than to prove mayhem, a crime which carried a more severe penalty, but which did not require infliction of permanent injury.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that this evidence was sufficient to raise the affirmative defense provided by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 131(m), and thereby to shift to the Commonwealth the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense did not exist. The Commonwealth presented no evidence to establish that, had defendant applied, &sect; 131(d) would have mandated denial of his application under one of the seven disqualifying criteria. The trial court reversibly erred by not instructing the jury as to the prosecution's burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this defense did not exist. Defendant was not entitled to an instruction that &sect; 131(e) required the police department to notify him in writing of the reason for denying him an application for renewal of his license, as &sect; 131 did not state that a denial was ineffective if not in writing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the university was granted authority to build a campus in Boston, it was granted authority to take land, with the exception of land owned by the utility and used for sewer pumping stations and other uses. Eventually, the utility decided to move its sewer operation, and the utility and the university engaged in negotiations concerning the university's taking of the land. In addition, the legislature enacted special legislation which allowed for the taking of the disputed property. At issue was the Spence doctrine, which held that state agencies could not challenge the constitutionality of the acts of another state agency. The utility and the university were both acting in their public capacities, and there was predominantly a public aspect to their dealings. The court held that it was clear from the language of the amendment in question that the legislature intended for title in the property to vest upon the passage of the act. The court further held that the utility could not circumvent the Spence doctrine, and thus it could not challenge the constitutionality of the amendment. Therefore, the trial court properly dismissed the case.</SPAN></P>

At common law, murder was a crime committed with premeditation and malice aforethought. The punishment was death. As murder was codified, initially under 1858 Mass. Acts ch. 154, Massachusetts adopted the common law definition but set murder out in two degrees. Premeditated murder constituted murder in the first degree, while murder committed with malice aforethought but not with premeditation, was considered murder in the second degree, punishable by life in prison. The crime of murder in the second degree existed under Massachusetts statutory law and tracked the common-law definition of murder, incorporating that portion of the common law definition of murder that was not incorporated into the statutory definition of murder in the first degree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town rejected the club's applications for a license nine times because the club was located outside of the town's adult entertainment zone. The federal courts upheld the constitutionality of the adult entertainment zone. The appellate court held that Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. XVI provided no greater protection from compliance with zoning than did the First Amendment. Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. XVI only required the town to show that its stated concerns about the secondary effects of adult entertainment had some basis in fact and were actually a motivating factor in the decision to create the zone. These factual matters were conclusively determined against the club in the federal cases, and principles of issue preclusion prevented those issues from being re-litigated. The trial court correctly found that the remainder of the club's state law claims were moot. Because the club could not have been &quot;grandfathered&quot; for purposes of zoning, the constitutionality of the earlier zones became moot issues with the enactment of the current zone. Even if the denial of the licenses in prior years were somehow improper, the club's claims still did not present a live issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While engaged in consensual sexual intercourse, plaintiff was lying on his back while defendant was on top of him. Defendant unilaterally decided to unlock her legs and place her feet on either side of plaintiff's abdomen. When defendant changed her position, she did not think about the possibility of injury to plaintiff. Shortly after taking this new position, defendant landed awkwardly on plaintiff, thereby causing him to suffer a penile fracture. The appellate court held that there were no comprehensive legal rules to regulate consensual sexual behavior and there were no commonly accepted customs or values that determined parameters for the intensely private and widely diverse forms of such behavior. In the absence of a consensus of community values or customs defining normal consensual sexual conduct, a jury or judge could not be expected to resolve a claim that certain consensual sexual conduct was undertaken without reasonable care. Therefore, no duty of reasonable care was owed by defendant. The appellate court further held that the record did not depict conduct that could be categorized as wanton or reckless. Thus, the action was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Greenfield Division of the District Court Department (Massachusetts), which, after a bench trial, convicted defendant of unlawfully resisting arrest by certain town police officers in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268, &sect; 32B. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in its handling of the issue, tendered by defendant, of self defense against excessive force used by the police officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers went to defendant's house for the purpose of arresting him for violating a restraining order. The officer testified at trial that, when defendant was informed that he was under arrest, defendant pulled the officer aside and attacked him, repeatedly striking him and another officer. He was eventually arrested and was charged with violating &sect; 32B. In contrast to the officer's testimony, defendant testified that the officers never told him of their purpose to arrest him and that, as defendant opened the front door, the officer rushed at him. Defendant testified that the officer attacked him, repeatedly punching him. The trial court refused to accept for his own guidance a general instruction on self-defense, and defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court held that, since there was no indication that the trial judge weighed the evidence on the self-defense proposition, the trial court committed prejudicial error calling for a new trial. According to the court, defendant was entitled to the judge's consideration of an implicit self-defense instruction because the evidence presented allowed the finding that the elements of a self-defense claim existed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 13B, and was sentenced to prison and five years of probation with a special condition that defendant should have no contact with children under 16 years of age. Later, the Clinton Division of the District Court Department, Worcester (Massachusetts), found that defendant had violated the restriction and revoked probation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he had an absolute affirmative defense to the no-contact probation violation in that he did not speak to, communicate with, touch, or have physical interaction with any member of the protected class. The court held that the record established that defendant violated the probationary term of no contact with children under 16 years of age and that revocation of probation was warranted. The evidence established that defendant intentionally positioned himself with his dog and antique car at a car show held in the parking lot of a candy store, a place where it was objectively reasonable to believe that children under the age of 16 would likely be in attendance. It was reasonable to find that the encounter at the car show had been contrived by defendant to place himself near the protected class. Further, the modus operandi of displaying his antique car and dog to entice children (a pattern and course of conduct exhibited in defendant's underlying sexual offenses) also supported the probation revocation. Finally, when defendant became aware that children under the age of 16 were present at the car show, he could have and should have left.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who pled guilty to making annoying telephone calls and accosting, appealed the revocation of his probation by the Wrentham Division of the District Court Department (Massachusetts). Defendant argued, inter alia, that it was not proved by the evidence proffered at the revocation hearing that he violated the condition requiring him not to have unsupervised contact with anyone under the age of 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant followed three young girls, drove his car close to one 14 year old girl as she walked home from school, stared at that girl and two other young girls from within a small grocery store, followed them back to the home of one, and repeatedly drove around the block. The appellate court held that a violation of a probationary no contact condition was proved by defendant's acts, in which defendant, by deliberate design, intentionally and inconsistently with the probationary restriction, positioned and interposed himself in a place wherein he knew or reasonably should have known that a protected person would be present, but nonetheless proceeded intentionally to position himself in that critical space in close proximity to a protected class and maintained a looming presence, posing a real and present risk. The Mass. Dist. Ct. R. Prob. Violation Proc. 6(b) requirement of written findings did not apply because the revocation of probation was not based solely on hearsay evidence as, among other evidence, defendant made inculpatory statements. Defendant cited no authority for the proposition that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 99, applied to recordings made outside of Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a Superior Court Department, Bristol (Massachusetts) judgment on a jury verdict, which convicted him of indecent assault and battery on a child under Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court held, first, that the evidence was sufficient and the law was not unconstitutionally vague. Massachusetts case law and common understanding provided a strong context for what constituted indecent behavior with a child, and defendant's own statements indicated that he well understood that he committed such behavior when he sought to entice the victim into participating with him in an act of pseudo-fellatio. Testimony regarding the victim's subjective understanding of what defendant meant by his references to sucking was probative on the issue of the indecency of the behavior, and given the other evidence, would not have led to a miscarriage of justice in any event. Finally, defendant's statements to the victim and to the police when they arrived, were highly probative of his intent to engage in indecent conduct. It was not error to instruct jurors that they might take those statements into account in their deliberations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before returning to their housing units from the recreation yard, the inmate and numerous other male inmates were strip-searched in groups of about three in an outside alcove walled on three sides with the fourth bounded by a chain link fence. A few women and children, leaving the prison, allegedly saw the inmates. The inmate conceded that the search was justified by suspicion of contraband. However, he claimed it was unduly invasive. The appellate court held that his claim for damages under the State Civil Rights Act failed as he showed no threats, intimidation, or coercion associated with the search. Also, it was not conducted for an illegitimate or vindictive purpose. While there were certain factual disputes regarding the search, the Department was entitled to immunity as it was not on fair notice that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. In addition, the trial court did not err in allowing summary judgment on the inmate's claims related to his transfer to a less desirable cell. The trial court correctly allowed the Department's motion for summary judgment as the record raised no inference of retaliatory motive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grantees filed suit against the grantor, seeking a declaration that they were the owners of the fee underlying a way.

The grantor then filed suit for a declaration that retroactive application of &sect; 58 was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the suit pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(9) on the ground that a prior action was pending. The grantor subsequently obtained a verdict in its favor in the first action. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed the grantor's action because the grantor had an opportunity to litigate its constitutional claim in the first action and did not do so. The court further held that the grantees were entitled to judgment in the first action because the grantor failed to establish its adverse possession claim. The court found that the case was tried by both parties on the theory that the grantor had permissive rights in the way and, thus, the grantor's use of the way was not &quot;irreconcilable&quot; with use of the property as a way.</SPAN></P>

The owners' lot did not comply. The land court found that there was no taking because, inter alia, the lot could be combined with the owner's contiguous lots for cluster development, so he was not deprived of all use of the lot. The appellate court agreed. Further, the owner could have built on the lot before &sect; 6.2.1 was enacted but did not; it was unreasonable for him to assume that the zoning by-laws would never change. The ordinance, as applied to the owner's lot, did not constitute a &quot;taking&quot; because (1) his property was not deprived of all economically beneficial use; (2) the ordinance was valid as applied to his property because it advanced legitimate state interests; (3) his investment-backed expectations were not unreasonably frustrated; (4) the economic impact of the ordinance on the property was not severe; and (5) there was no physical invasion of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an enforcement action under the former Massachusetts Watershed Protection Act, 1992 Mass. Acts ch. 36, codified in part at former Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 92, &sect;&sect; 104 and 107A, replaced by the Watershed Management Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 92A 1/2, defendant landowners appealed from a summary judgment of the Superior Court Department, Suffolk (Massachusetts), in favor of plaintiff Commonwealth and finding the Act did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act forbade certain types of building and other alterations in the landscape surrounding bodies of water that fed into the watersheds that provided water to major cities in the Commonwealth. The Act included a process, however, under which landowners could seek exemptions from certain prohibitions. The landowners did not seek a variance, but simply proceeded to expand their beach and make other changes. The trial court found the Act did not violate their due process property rights, but the appeals court held that the trial court should not even have reached the issue of federal and state constitutionality. The landowners' claims were not ripe for decision, because they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by seeking relief from the regulations. An additional constitutional argument, that Mass. Const. amend. art. XLIX, which empowered the Commonwealth to acquire property for conservation purposes, required such acquisition in every case in which use of property was limited for environmental reasons, had no basis in the constitutional language or in cases interpreting it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment to dismiss the landowners' constitutional counterclaims as unripe and affirmed it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two young children were killed in a fire while locked in a second-floor bedroom of an apartment which defendant shared with the children's mother. There was evidence that defendant had assisted in modifying the children's bedroom door to lock them in when defendant and the mother found it inconvenient to take care of them. Defendant was not the children's biological father, was not married to the mother, and was not the children's legal guardian, but had assumed the role of their father and provided for their supervision and care. As a result of the fire, defendant was convicted of two counts of &sect;13J(b). The sole issue on appeal was whether Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 13J was impermissibly vague for failure to adequately define those persons subject to its prohibitions. The court concluded that it was not. The words used in &sect; 13J, in their statutory context, did not require persons of ordinary intelligence to speculate as to their meaning. Persons having &quot;care and custody&quot; were understood to include not only biological parents, but any persons, regardless of formal familial relationship, who had assumed either permanent or temporary responsibility for a child's care.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Superior Court Department at Norfolk (Massachusetts) of manslaughter, assault with intent to rape, drugging a person for sexual intercourse, four counts of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and four counts of mingling poison with food, drink, or medicine. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, on three occasions, brought a total of four women to his home, drugged them with a drink containing a prescribed sleeping medication, and then engaged in conduct that could be construed as a sexual assault or an attempted sexual assault. One of the victims died from the drink that she was given. On appeal, the court found that defendant's act in surreptitiously mixing his prescription sleeping medication with alcohol and serving the mixture to the woman who died showed an indifference to and disregard of the high degree of likelihood that substantial harm would result to her. This was enough to prove that the death resulted from defendant's wanton and reckless disregard of her health when he gave her the mixture of sleeping pills and alcohol. Thus, the involuntary manslaughter conviction was warranted. Further, a doctor's testimony was a sufficient basis from which the jury could infer that the dosage of temazepam administered to her was a poison under Ms. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 28. However, there was no evidence that the drugs given the other women were a poison under ch. 265, &sect; 28. Finally, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in trying the cases together.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments were affirmed with the exception of three of the four indictments for mingling poison with drink. As to the three mingling poison with a drink indictments, the judgments were reversed, the verdicts set aside, and judgments were to be entered for defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed a petition to commit defendant as a sexually dangerous person prior to his completion of sentences for several convictions of sexually assaulting young children. At defendant's trial, a police report was admitted containing an allegation, which had not led to an indictment, that defendant had assaulted an unidentified child. The court held the admission of that evidence constituted prejudicial error and required a new trial. The record clearly showed that the police report was admitted for the truth of the matter stated therein, namely, that he had sexually assaulted the six-year-old boy on the same occasion he assaulted another young girl; the latter assault had resulted in prosecution and conviction. The assault on the boy was inadmissible under ch. 123A, &sect; 14; it did not constitute a report relating to defendant's prior sexual offenses, and it was not admissible as &quot;any other evidence&quot; tending to show that defendant was sexually dangerous. The error was prejudicial because it supported an inference that defendant was seeking victims beyond those who were known to him and enhanced a picture of him as a predator who was out of control.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 127, &sect; 129 (repealed), in effect when the sentence was imposed, and, therefore, applicable, precluded good time deductions for a prisoner committing a new offense while confined. A halfway house was a confining place of rehabilitation, within the definition of a correctional facility, in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 125, &sect; 1. The inmate's resentencing on the conviction for which he was serving this sentence, resulting in a shorter sentence that expired before he committed the new crime, gave him no relief, as his confinement when he committed the new crime was lawful until the conviction causing it was reversed. Apprendi did not apply, as a loss of statutory good time was no sentence enhancement.

The appellate court agreed and vacated that conviction. However, defendant was adequately notified that his behavior was prohibited under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 53. Defendant used sexually explicit language toward the girls, stepped out of his car, and pulled down his pants. Regardless of what the girls saw, the conduct sent them fleeing to the safety of the house. The girls testified that defendant's comments scared and confused them and made them uncomfortable due to the sexual nature of the comments, and that the girls were frightened, scared, and afraid of defendant coming out of the car and hurting them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a youthful offender, appealed the judgment of the Lawrence Division of the District Court Department (Massachusetts) which denied defendant's motion for postconviction relief. Defendant challenged the legality of the combination sentence he received pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, &sect; 58(b), arguing that the statute was ambiguous and unconstitutionally vague, and that the sentence imposed on him was unlawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was 16 he was indicted as a youthful offender, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, &sect; 54, on charges of assault with intent to murder, &quot;carjacking,&quot; and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. After turning 17 he tendered a guilty plea to all three offenses and submitted a proposed disposition: commitment to the department of youth services (DYS) until the age of 21 and a two-year sentence to a house of correction, on and after, to be suspended for two years. The plea was accepted by the court. Defendant violated his probation within two years. The judge, who was the plea and sentencing judge in the earlier proceedings, imposed the original sentence; that is, he committed defendant to the DYS until age 21 and ordered that defendant thereafter serve two years in a house of correction. The appellate court held the legislature's intent was to preserve the sentencing judge's well-established discretion to fashion either a concurrent or consecutive sentence, depending upon the circumstances. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, &sect; 58 was readily decipherable.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 30A, &sect; 14, plaintiff dissident policyholders appealed from a judgment on the pleadings of the Superior Court Department, Suffolk (Massachusetts), that upheld a decision of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance approving defendant insurance company's demutualization plan, submitted pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &sect; 19E.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &sect; 19E provided a method by which mutual insurance companies could convert to publicly held companies. The statute required such companies to submit plans to the commissioner that demonstrated that policyholders, the former owners of the company, would be properly compensated for their interests. Although policyholders overwhelmingly approved the insurance company's plan, and the commissioner had also approved it, two dissident policyholders challenged the plan as not providing sufficient compensation for the loss of certain rights, such as the right to vote for directors. The appellate court approved the deferential review by the trial court of the commissioner's decision, noting that her opinion made clear that she had properly considered all the factors she was required to consider in making her fairness determination and that where she had not made specific findings, she had incorporated by reference voluminous findings made in her approval of a very similar plan submitted by another insurance company, a perfectly permissible approach. The policyholders' other claims were so intertwined with the &sect; 19E claims as to preclude separate consideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of four counts of rape of a child under 16, in violation of Mass. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raped his wife's child repeatedly. He would ejaculate on her stomach and then wipe it off with either a towel or undershirt. After the rapes were reported, the mother consented to a search of the house. Defendant's genetic material was found on his undershirt. On appeal, defendant admitted that his wife had the authority to consent to the search, and did not challenge the authority of the police to test his undershirt for seminal fluid. However, he contended that his wife's consent could not be extended to authorize the testing of his undershirt for genetic material, as a person could not consent to the testing of someone else's genetic material. The appellate court found that where the police lawfully obtained evidence, it could be subjected to scientific testing. There was no prejudice shown in the admission of the victim's hospital records. Defense counsel's attempt to use portions of the records, in an attempt to illustrate inconsistencies, was a reasonable tactical choice and was not ineffective counsel. Although the prosecutor made a questionable comment in closing, which had the potential to elicit sympathy for the victim, it was unlikely that it was prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two violations of probation. His counsel moved for a continuance of the violation proceedings to await a psychiatric report. The district court denied the motion, found against defendant on one of the violations, and adjourned the hearing without a final judgment to await the report. When defendant chose to terminate the psychiatric evaluation, the district court revoked his probation and sentenced him to two concurrent two-year prison terms. On appeal, defendant contended that the continuance should have been granted. The Commonwealth moved to dismiss the appeal as moot because defendant's admission to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty had been accepted on an assault and battery charge that had constituted one of the two probation violations. The court denied dismissal of the appeal, pretermitting the issue of mootness as not fully argued. Defendant's admission of sufficient facts on the assault and battery charge was not the equivalent of a conviction. The court affirmed the judgment. The denial of the continuance was within the district court's discretion, and the issue exhausted itself when defendant chose not to continue the evaluation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident's renewal application of his license to carry firearms was denied by the police chief due to two prior convictions of the resident.

The court held that there was no abuse of discretion in the police chief's denial pursuant to ch. 140, &sect; 131(f). The retroactive application of ch. 140, &sect; 131 was reasonable in light of the wording of the statute and the utmost importance of the public safety which regulation by licensing was designed to protect. The resident's constitutional arguments to ch. 140, &sect; 131 were found to lack merit. Claims regarding the unconstitutionality with respect to ex post facto and double jeopardy were inapplicable because ch. 140, &sect; 131 was not punitive. There was no lack of due process or denial of the resident's rights because carrying a firearm was not an absolute right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Superior Court Department, Middlesex (Massachusetts), which convicted him of breaking and entering a vehicle in the nighttime with the intent to commit a felony in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &sect; 16; possession of burglarious tools in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &sect; 49; and receiving stolen goods with a value less than $ 250 in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &sect; 60.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two automobile break-ins occurred in the early morning and a police investigation led to defendant. Two officers were let into defendant's apartment by defendant, who answered questions. While inside, several items that had been reported stolen were observed. The police returned and defendant agreed to go with them to the police station. Defendant's motion to suppress the seized stolen items was denied and defendant was convicted of several offenses. On his appeal, the court vacated in part, remanded, and affirmed in part. The court first held that defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because the second entry by the police was made pursuant to defendant's implied voluntary consent. Defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty was properly denied because the Commonwealth provided sufficient evidence to prove that defendant had intended to commit a felony when he broke into the two vehicles. The trial court erred, however, in instructing the jury that any larceny constituted the felony element of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &sect; 16 because under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &sect; 30, a larceny was not a felony unless the value of the property stolen exceeded $ 250.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the portion of the trial court's judgment that convicted defendant of breaking and entering with the intent to commit a felony and remanded to the trial court for resentencing on the lesser included offense of breaking and entering a motor vehicle with intent to commit a misdemeanor. The court affirmed the remaining portions of the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a jury-waived trial, defendant was convicted for home invasion committed with a firearm and armed robbery, and acquitted of conspiracy to distribute a Class B drug. The Hampshire Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) sentenced defendant to 20 years and a day in state prison on the home invasion charge, and a concurrent sentence of 18 to 20 years for the armed robbery. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect;18C, the home invasion statute, was unconstitutional on its face because of various infirmities in its penalty section. Defendant contended that the penalty scheme under which he was tried and convicted was facially unlawful and unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous. Defendant argued that the statute's 20-year fixed term for the aggravated home invasion portion of the statute conflicted with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 279, &sect; 24, that it inconsistently also mandates a 10-year minimum sentence, that the statute ran counter to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127, &sect; 133, and that the statute inconsistently provided for and prohibited probation. The appeals court held that the Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 18C stated that 20 years was the maximum allowable sentence and 10 years was the minimum. In addition, the appeals court concluded that probation was prohibited under the statute. Thus, the appeals court concluded that the trial judge erred in sentencing defendant to 20 years and a day. As for defendant's waiver of a jury trial, the appeals court found no error since the court engaged in a thorough colloquy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer sued appellee commission for refusing to grant him a permit. After remand from the Supreme Judicial Court, the Suffolk Land Court Department (Massachusetts) granted the commission's renewed motion to dismiss, under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the developer's claims that 1989 Mass. Acts ch. 716 was void for vagueness and, as applied, violated his right to equal protection of the laws. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer said the permit denial was a regulatory taking. The appellate court held the trial court correctly found this claim was not ripe, as further interaction between the developer and the commission would not have been futile. He did not show 1989 Mass. Acts ch. 716, as applied to him, was so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. The statute had a rational and well-defined basis. It established criteria for the commission's evaluation of the development proposal and required more detailed guidelines providing a framework for a &quot;probable benefits and detriments&quot; analysis. The developer's complaint did not identify his proposal's benefits or how they outweighed its adverse environmental effects and, in conclusory fashion, claimed he satisfied minimum performance standards. He did not allege impermissible considerations such as race, religion, or punishing his exercise of constitutional rights entered into the commission's decision. His general allegation, without specifics, that others similarly situated were granted permits, did not support his equal protection claim, even on a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The trial court declared the ordinance to be unconstitutionally vague and concluded that the living arrangements of the owners' group of tenants formed a single housekeeping unit which was entitled to the same treatment as families under the city's ordinances. The city argued that the trial court's finding was an error. The appellate court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague, as nothing on the record suggested that the ordinance was open to a varied application.

Although the trial judge did not live in the county, the appellate court's review of the magazines led it to conclude that no reasonable and disinterested observer anywhere in the Commonwealth would think them suitable for display to children. Accordingly, they could not possibly meet the standards of any of the Commonwealth's counties and necessarily fell below those prevailing in the county at the time of defendant's violation of &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court noted that the inmate failed to demonstrate that he suffered an actual injury. The appeals court noted that the record established that the inmate was sufficiently able to communicate with counsel such that he was able to file the instant complaint. In addition, the guard's presence outside the door was reasonably related to penological interests since the inmate was placed in the subject room because of an alleged disciplinary infraction. As for the inmate's claims under the MCRA and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, the appeals court upheld summary judgment since there were no constitutional violations.

A probation officer told defendant that he would be required to submit to random urine testing. Defendant refused to sign the new condition of probation. The appellate court held that judges could order random urine screens as a probation condition, but that condition had to come from the judge, not from a probation officer. Probationers were entitled to reasonably specific conditions that provide clear guidelines as to what and when their actions or omissions would constitute a violation of their probation. Here, the appellate court held the probation condition ordering treatment as deemed necessary was ambiguous, and did not read by implication in that condition the requirement that defendant undergo random urine screens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Wareham Division of the District Court Department, Massachusetts, dismissed the complaint charging defendant with assault and battery on the ground that continuing the prosecution would be inconsistent with the interests of public justice. The Commonwealth appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth contended that dismissal was inappropriate because the decision amounted to an unconstitutional usurpation of power reserved exclusively to the executive branch, that the judge did not follow the procedures set out in Brandano, and that dismissal was inappropriate. The court of appeals agreed with the second and third contentions. The Brandano procedure required defendant to file an affidavit containing all the facts and the law relied upon in justification of a dismissal. The Commonwealth then had an opportunity to file a counter affidavit. Upon receipt of the affidavits, the court was to hear disputed matters revealed by the affidavits unless the judge concluded that the affidavits on their face showed that dismissal was unwarranted. After the hearing, if the judge concluded that the dismissal was in the interests of public justice, he had to record his or her findings of fact accompanied by the reasons for the dismissal decision. Defendant's affidavit was signed by counsel, not by a person with personal knowledge of the factual basis of the motion, as required by Mass. R. Crim. P. 13(a)(2). The Commonwealth filed no affidavit, relying instead on oral comment.</SPAN></P>
