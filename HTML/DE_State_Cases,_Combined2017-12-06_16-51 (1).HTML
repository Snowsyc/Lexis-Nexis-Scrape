</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were two limited liability companies (LLCs) and two of their unit holders. They had operations based in another state, but were domiciled in Delaware. Plaintiffs sued defendants, two individuals, in both states, seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. Both defendants moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. One defendant requested that the action be stayed or dismissed in favor of the other state's litigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs complained that defendants were making certain false claims of ownership in the companies. As a result, uncertainty existed about who could make company decisions. Plaintiffs relied solely on Delaware's long-arm statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3104, to support their claim of personal jurisdiction over one defendant. The court found that plaintiffs pointed to only two acts committed in Delaware that had any relevance to the instant litigation, which were the actions of forming each company as limited liability companies in Delaware. There was no indication whatsoever that the one defendant had any role in the founding or formation of either. Therefore, the court lacked personal jurisdiction. As to the other defendant, jurisdiction was proper as he was a founder, large unit holder, and top officer that had been voted off as a manager of both companies. Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect;&sect; 18-110(a) and 18-109(a) provided a basis for the exercise of personal jurisdiction and minimum contacts were shown. However, the court found it to be a mystery as to why plaintiffs had chosen to spread their claims over two states, and a stay of the Delaware action was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction was granted, and the other's was denied. The other defendant's motion for a stay was granted, and the stay was to remain in effect indefinitely, but plaintiffs could perfect service of process on the other defendant and could move to lift the stay no earlier than a certain date, or on the date of the termination of the equity action in the other state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, county employees who were former United States military veterans, protested the exclusion of their military experience from a pension eligibility program under New Castle County, Del., Ordinance 97-114 Substitute No. 1, modifying New Castle County, Del., Code &sect; 26-594, and sued defendants, the county, county council, and county executive. The county moved for summary judgment on the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 equal protection claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance credited the pension eligibility of county employees for their prior work experience with other governmental entities, except the federal government. The chancery court used the &quot;rational basis&quot; scrutiny test to determine the ordinance was constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. &quot;Strict&quot; or &quot;intermediate&quot; scrutiny were not warranted; servicemen or United States employees were not a protected class. Under the rational basis test, the county's ordinance was to be upheld if there was any reasonably conceivable set of facts that could establish a rational relationship between the challenged regulation and a legitimate government end. The chancery court could have provided that rational basis, but the county's basis, that the pension plan was modified to attract and retain employees having prior experience at jobs similar to those they were performing at a county level, because such employees would more likely better and more efficiently serve the public interest, although, arguably, not the most desirable, was rational. Improved county services were a legitimate government interest. The ordinance was constitutional so there was no &sect; 1983 claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chancery court granted the motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff adjacent property owners sought a permanent injunction prohibiting defendant Town from issuing a building permit based on its approval of the site plan, and enjoining the Town from further facilitation of the construction of defendant store's distribution center. They alleged, inter alia, that the approval process followed by the Town was flawed, and thus illegal or unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Town approved a site plan submitted by the store contemplating construction of a distribution center. The adjacent owners claimed that an injunction was justified based on the alleged illegalities and constitutional violations, because, unless enjoined, the store would build a distribution facility which will cause irreparable harm due to unwarranted noise, pollution, and danger emanating from the site. The court held that since the adjacent owners could not establish an interest distinguishable from the other residents of the Town, they could not show standing to attack the Town's actions based on statutory grounds. The adjacent owners could not show that any actions or failures of the planning and zoning commission caused them potential irreparable harm. In sum, the Town had substantial evidence to conclude, based upon the store's representations, that emissions from the property would not endanger health or property and that sound levels would comply with the Town ordinance. The court saw no potential irreparable harm in dismissing the allegations of zoning violations, without prejudice, to allow the adjacent owners to pursue a remedy at law once a building permit issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The request for a permanent injunction was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowners instituted an action against respondents, a mayor and a town council, attacking the constitutionality of provisions in Camden, Del., Zoning Ordinance art. IV, &sect; 5.2A, which mandated minimum acreage for townhouse developments and also required that a minimum of 25 percent of the area be set aside for common open space. Both sides sought summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners wished to build townhouses but were thwarted by application of &sect; 5.2A's minimum area and set aside provisions. The landowners filed the instant action and before the court were the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. The court granted partial summary judgment with respect to the facial challenge to the ordinance in favor of the city council and the mayor. The landowners failed to rebut the presumption that the ordinance was constitutional because there was a rational basis for the minimum area requirement, including concerns of density, aesthetics, and avoiding a scattered population. Similarly, a common open space provision was facially constitutional because it was supported by reasonable considerations regarding density and the enjoyment by the townhouse residents of their community. The landowners' taking claim was not yet ripe for adjudication because they had not pursued their rights through the town's regulatory process for application of a variance or other regulatory lenience. Moreover, even if the claim were ripe, the open space requirement did not constitute a taking because it did not render the landowners' property completely valueless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the landowners' motion for summary judgment with respect to their facial challenge to the zoning ordinance. The court granted the town's motion for summary judgment with respect to the landowners' facial challenge to the zoning ordinance. The landowners' takings claim was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sheriff sued defendants, the Attorney General of the State of Delaware and the Secretary of Delaware's Department of Public Safety, claiming they interfered with his exercise of his powers granted by Del. Const. art. XV, &sect; 1, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Defendants moved to dismiss under Del. Ch. Ct. R. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and Del. Ch. Ct. R. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff claimed he had the constitutional authority to enforce all laws relating to the safety of persons and property within the county. Defendant, he argued, illegally limited his exercise of this authority by denying his deputies the right to be trained by the state police, or have emergency equipment on their vehicles. He sought a declaration of his rights and injunctions: (1) preventing defendants from interfering with the sheriff's use of emergency equipment or his deputies' access to police training; and (2) requiring the Attorney General to withdraw two of her opinion letters. The court held it lacked jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief, as the sheriff was seeking to vindicate a legal, not an equitable right, the superior court had jurisdiction. That the sheriff sought injunctive relief did not convert his claim to an equitable one. The court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims for injunctive relief, as to defendants' interference with his powers and the Attorney General's opinions. The request for injunctive relief as to the training of deputies failed to state a claim. Any ruling on the emergency equipment claim would have been merely advisory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff's request for declaratory relief was transferred to the superior court. His requests for injunctive relief as to his powers as a conservator of the peace, as to enrollment of deputies in the police academy, and for an order directing the Attorney General to rescind earlier opinions and to issue future opinions, were dismissed. The request for injunctive relief regarding display of emergency lights was dismissed without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner company sought, among other things, a declaratory judgment that it was legally entitled to operate a dry and solid waste transfer station in defendant county. The county moved to dismiss the petition, claiming that defendants, the individual members of a levy court, were not proper defendants, that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and other errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the county's motion to dismiss as to the company's claim that the county's conduct violated its substantive and procedural due process rights. For a constitutional challenge to a land-use decision to be ripe, the local governmental authorities had to arrive at a final, definitive position regarding how they would apply the regulations at issue. In a zoning dispute, a property owner suffered no mature constitutional injury until the zoning authority defined the application of the zoning ordinance and defined the harm to the owner. Those criteria were not satisfied. The county had not commenced any formal enforcement action, and by pressing its equitable estoppel claim, the company had shortcut the administrative appeals process that could result in a final definitive position, and the claim was not ripe. The court also granted the motion to dismiss the claims against the members of the levy court. The company asserted that the members' individual presence was required in order to afford complete relief. No legal or factual basis for this assertion was provided, and the court fathomed no reason why the individual members were proper individual defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county's motion to dismiss counts IV and V, alleging constitutional violations, was granted.

Defendants asserted the department had the unreviewable discretion to refuse to allow the filing of a discrimination charge, or in the alternative that the manager had not set forth a cognizable claim of sex discrimination. The court found the manager stated a claim in equity that the department abused its discretion in its handling of her discrimination claim. The act did not permit the department to refuse to accept a charge of discrimination; rather, the department had to accept a charge and dismiss it by written decision if it concluded that a charge was without factual or legal merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, property owners, brought an action attacking the constitutionality of respondent town's zoning ordinance which mandated a minimum area of three acres for townhouse developments with a minimum of 25 percent of the area to be set aside for open space. The owners sought an injunction to preclude enforcement of these provisions. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment, and the owners moved to amend their complain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the owners had an adequate remedy at law, that the matter was not ripe, and other factors. The owners argued that the zoning ordinance exceeded the police power authorized by the constitutions of both the United States and the State of Delaware, and that the ordinance amounted to a taking of their property without just compensation. The court held that the claims were within the court's subject matter jurisdiction. The court held that application of the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies was misplaced in cases where the expertise and specialization of an agency could not provide an adequate remedy. The town did not argue that it was qualified to adjudicate the merits of the constitutional attack initiated by the owners with respect to the challenged ordinances. Accordingly, holding the owners to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies on the facts of this case would be inequitable. The court held the case was ripe for decision. A timely determination of whether the ordinance was constitutional on its face would outweigh any potential benefit that might result from judicial restraint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town's cross-motion for summary judgment was denied with respect to subject matter jurisdiction, ripeness, and exhaustion of administrative remedies, and the property owners' motion to amend was granted. The court deferred consideration of the substantive merits of the dispute as framed by the cross-motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect; 2531, et seq., against the defendants, two florist corporations and their owner. The owner filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and the defendants together filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants set up dummy listings in state phone books so that when customers called to order flowers, the calls were forwarded to the corporations' principal place of business outside of the state. The State alleged that the dummy listings were for the sole purpose of diverting consumer business out-of-state and filed an action for fraud and deceptive trade practices. The chancery court denied the owner's motion to dismiss and the defendants' motions to dismiss on every count of the State's complaint except for its claim under Del. Code. Ann. tit. 6, &sect; 2513(a)(1). The State's exercise of personal jurisdiction over the owner was proper. He engaged in substantial contacts in the state and there was a nexus to the state having a clear relationship to the tortious injury alleged. The means the state adopted to protect consumers, i.e., treating businesses outside the local calling area differently from businesses inside the local calling area, did not pass constitutional muster. The state's purpose could have been readily achieved by available nondiscriminatory means, namely, imposing the same requirements on businesses both inside and outside the local calling area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction was denied. The defendants' motions to dismiss three counts were denied, and their motions to dismiss one count was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment in a cause of action seeking to require the Council of Delaware Association of Professional Engineers (DAPE) to honor plaintiffs' petitions nominating plaintiffs to the DAPE Council.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff engineers filed suit seeking to require defendants to place plaintiffs' names on the election ballot for a professional association council. Defendant, the state professional organization, denied plaintiffs' requests to be placed on the ballot based on the fact that plaintiffs' petitions were filed late. However, defendants sent out notice of the impending election on the date of the deadline, thereby guaranteeing that all petitions would be returned late. After both parties reached agreement as to questions of subject matter jurisdiction, both parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court found that defendants followed the advice of the Delaware attorney general's office in denying plaintiffs' petitions. Further, defendants, despite that advice, did have the authority to place plaintiffs' names on the ballot even though plaintiffs' petitions were received late. Finally, the plaintiffs, under a theory of equitable estoppel, were entitled to have their names placed on the election ballot as a matter of law. As such, plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on a state law estoppel claim and on a claim for attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment was granted, because, under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, the Council of the Delaware Association of Professional Engineers did have the authority and duty to place the plaintiffs' names on the election ballot. Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an action pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 225 seeking restoration to their seats on the board of directors of defendant corporation, contending a voting agreement precluded their removal. Defendant responded by arguing plaintiffs were putatively removed &quot;for cause&quot; pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 141(k)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action governed by multistate laws, plaintiff shareholders sought restoration to the board of directors of defendant corporation, contending their removal violated defendant's certificate of incorporation and a voting agreement with a non-party corporation that controlled three seats on the board as a result of a capital infusion. Plaintiffs as a family controlled four board seats; three were held by family members, and one was held by an officer of defendant. Plaintiffs contended the voting agreement guaranteed their seats until the non-party corporation's mandatory redemption right was triggered, and that they could not be removed even for what constituted good cause. Defendant, alleging serious breaches of fiduciary duty by plaintiffs, contended plaintiffs were properly removed for cause pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 141(k)(2). Holding that the validity of a voting agreement among the shareholders of a Delaware corporation was governed by Delaware law, the chancery court dismissed plaintiffs' action because Delaware law considered the right to remove directors to be a fundamental element of stockholder authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Concluding the voting agreement could not be read as imposing obligations on other directors to vote for plaintiffs in director elections, the court dismissed plaintiffs' action seeking restoration to their seats on the board of directors of defendant corporation on the grounds that a director could be removed for cause notwithstanding an agreement that required his maintenance in the office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff limited liability company formed a new Delaware venture with defendant investor. Both defendant and plaintiff's principal resided in Florida. Subsequently, the parties disputed as to who controlled the new venture under the terms of the venture's operating agreement, and plaintiff brought an action in Delaware for declaratory judgment against defendant. Defendant moved to dismiss the suit on grounds of lack of in personam jurisdiction and forum non conveniens. The court held that defendant impliedly consented to being sued in a Delaware court to adjudicate disputes so inherently intertwined with his fiduciary position as a manager of the venture. Further, dismissal forum non conveniens grounds could occur only in the rare case in which the combination and weight of the factors balanced overwhelmingly in favor of the defendant.

P. 61(b)(6) to amend his postconviction relief (PCR) motion should be granted &quot;as a matter of course&quot; because it was filed prior to the State filing a response to the original motion; [2]-The PCR motion warranted summary dismissal under Rule 61(i)(1) because it was procedurally barred as untimely, in that it was filed more than 19 years after the conviction became final and the inmate did not assert an entitlement to relief; [3]-The inmate's claim that imposition of a life sentence for being a habitual offender under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4214(b) was too strict based on his lack of a violent history lacked merit, as his history of multiple burglary convictions mandated that result.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. tit. 9, &sect; 1314; the possibility that the state department of transportation would someday modify the intersection did not permit the county department of land use to approve the TIS; [2]-The county's disapproval of the TIS and its rejection of the developer's record plan did not amount to an unconstitutional exaction because an essential element of the unconstitutional exaction doctrine was a coercive demand by the government, and there was no evidence the county ever made any demand, much less a coercive one.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4202(a), as it was constitutional on its face, despite that there was no intent element, because the minimum mandatory prison term was a relatively small penalty and a conviction would not &quot;gravely besmirch&quot; defendant's reputation; [2]-Moreover, &sect; 4202(a) was constitutional as applied to defendant, as the facts established that he acted &quot;knowingly&quot; as to his involvement in an accident and the failure to stop; [3]-The evidence sufficiently supported his convictions for manslaughter, leaving the scene, and endangering the welfare of a child, as defendant acted recklessly by driving in excess of the speed limit after consuming alcohol and disregarding the risk that his conduct caused.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8145 against his father, alleging that he was sexually abused, the AC was not entitled to summary judgment on the father's counterclaim for libel, slander, and defamation because it was not clear that the claim was time-barred under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8119, based on the father's assertion that the AC made defamatory statements within the two-year period; [2]-Moreover, the AC's assertion that the claim was barred under the absolute privilege rule did not warrant summary judgment because the father asserted that defamatory statements were made outside the judicial context; [3]-The father established a plausible prima facie case of defamation based on the AC's letter to the Governor, which was facially defamatory and within the two-year period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury returned a verdict that awarded the patients money jointly and severally against defendants in the patients' medical negligence action. Thereafter, the parties filed post-trial motions. The court found that the patients were entitled to an award of costs, as judgment was awarded in their favor. Such costs included court cost and expert witness fees, which the patients voluntarily reduced, the filing fee, and service of process costs pursuant to Rule 54(d) and Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 5101 and 8906. The court found that the costs associated with the litigation were reasonable, as were the reduced fees of the experts. It was noted that the patients' request for such relief was unopposed. As defendants rejected the patients' settlement demands, which were less than the ultimate verdict, PR-JI was warranted under &sect; 2301(d). A challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 2301(d) failed, as it had been upheld previously and supported the policy that favored settlements. Further, the interest award was equally applicable to the loss of consortium claim. The PR-JI and PO-JI awards were calculated based on the same rate. There was no cause to reform the original verdict sheet.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the patients' motions for costs and for PR-JI and PO-JI. The court denied the hospital's motion to reform the original verdict sheet.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a preferred provider organization (PPO) settlement class (SC), filed a motion for partial summary judgment (PSJ) in plaintiff primary insurer's (PI) action, seeking a declaration that it owed no duty to indemnify the PPO for a judgment against it under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2203.1. Both the SC and cross-defendant excess insurer (EI) sought PSJ with respect to the remaining dispute as to coverage between them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PI issued a primary managed care organization errors and omissions policy to the PPO, and the PPO also secured excess policies. A group of Louisiana health care providers, the SC, sued the PPO and others, alleging violations of Louisiana's PPO Act, &sect; 40:2203.1, due to lack of notice under &sect; 40:2203.1(B). The PPO settled and assigned its insurance rights to the SC. The PPO's PI sought a declaratory judgment that it had no duty to indemnify the PPO for the Louisiana judgment. Settlements were thereafter reached between the PI and the PPO and SC, and between the SC and some EIs. In resolving the remaining claims between the SC and one EI, the court found that the SC initially showed that the judgment was covered under the policy. However, the EI established that the policy excluded coverage, as the settlement under &sect; 40:2203.1(G) constituted &quot;fines, penalties, or multiplied damages&quot; which were not recoverable under the policy's definition of &quot;loss.&quot; Further, the claims were not within the definitions of &quot;antitrust activity&quot; under the primary policy. Although claims for attorneys' fees were not waived, they were not within the coverage for a &quot;loss.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the SC's motion for PSJ, and it granted the EI's motion for PSJ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the employee allegedly used a state-owned computer to make political postings on an internet forum, he was terminated pursuant to the Merit Rules and &sect; 5954. The appellate court found, inter alia, that as &sect; 5954 was modeled after the Federal Hatch Act, it was completely logical and appropriate for the Board to consider related case law and advisory opinions in the process of developing an analytical framework for its own use. The Board considered and rejected the possibility of using Del. Code Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 2509A, as suggested by the employee. Regardless of the definition chosen for the term &quot;political activity,&quot; the employee's conduct unquestionably fell within it. Not only was he actively running for political office, he was explaining to people on the internet why votes should be cast for him, all from his state-owned computer. As the government's interest in maintaining a nonpartisan civil service outweighed the employee's interest in making political postings while working on government property, &sect; 5954 did not violate the First Amendment. In addition, it was not overly broad or impermissibly vague in all of its applications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents alleged that, as a consequence of the mother's employment, she was exposed, and the child was exposed in utero, to the reproductively harmful chemicals and substances that caused physical injury to the child. The court found, inter alia, that based on the well-pleaded allegations in the complaint, there was little question that Arizona substantive law applied to the parents' claims. The fact that the mother was an employee of the employers did not convert the child's personal injury claims for in utero exposure into a derivative claim under Arizona law. In addition, the child's fundamental right to bring an action for personal injuries in Ariz. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 6 could not be abrogated by the exclusivity provision Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1022(A). While the parents' allegations were insufficient to plead an intentional tort, they sufficiently pleaded causes of action for negligence, premises liability, strict liability, abnormally dangerous/ultra hazardous activity, breach of an assumed duty, and loss of consortium.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a driver and a passenger in a car, moved to suppress evidence obtained during a traffic stop which resulted with them being charged with various drug trafficking offenses after police found drugs on their persons. They alleged the search and seizure were unconstitutional. The crux of their motion was that the arresting officer unlawfully extended the traffic stop beyond its constitutionally permissible purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed a car crossing three lanes of traffic without signaling. The officer initiated a traffic stop. He detected an odor of raw marijuana emanating from the vehicle. He also testified that defendant passenger was extremely nervous and refused to make eye contact when asked to produce identification. As defendant driver  stepped out of his vehicle, two bags of heroin fell to the ground. Upon seeing the bags of heroin on the ground, the officer arrested defendant driver and searched his person discovering more packets of heroin. A search of defendant passenger yielded a large bag of crack cocaine and a smaller bag of marijuana. The initial stop was justified by the traffic infraction. As defendant driver was already validly stopped for a traffic violation, the additional intrusion was de minimus. Even assuming, arguendo, that a second &quot;seizure&quot; occurred when the officer asked defendant driver to step out of the car, the seizure was reasonable. The totality of the circumstances established a reasonable suspicion that defendants were engaged in drug-related activity and justified the detention of defendants beyond the time necessary to issue the traffic citation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a state police officer attempted to stop defendant for driving with a suspended or revoked license, defendant pulled his car over to the side of the road and stopped briefly. He then pulled his car back out on to the road and fled. After defendant's arrest, and within 4 hours of him driving a vehicle, the police obtained a blood sample from him, which revealed the presence of both active and inactive metabolites of marijuana. Defendant claimed that &sect; 4177(a)(6) was overbroad and vague because it did not require the State to prove that he was under the influence of marijuana while driving and that an ordinary person was not able to reasonably discern how long traces of marijuana, whether ingested legally or not, might remain in one's blood system. The court found, inter alia, that defendant's arguments had previously been considered and rejected. Prohibiting drivers from driving with any level of drugs in their blood was rationally related to the State's interest in promoting traffic safety. In addition, &sect; 4177(a)(6) adequately informed the public of the prohibited conduct. Consequently, it was neither unconstitutionally overbroad nor vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case arising from the crash of a helicopter in Mexico, plaintiffs, representatives of the pilots and five of the seven passengers, filed wrongful death actions against defendants, two corporations. The corporations filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds of forum non conveniens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether Mexico could exercise jurisdiction over the corporations. The court was convinced that Mexico was not an available alternative forum, a requirement to dismiss a complaint on the ground of forum non conveniens. Mexican courts would almost certainly dismiss the suit because the corporations were domiciled in the United States. The corporations could not argue that Mexico was an available alternative forum when they admitted that, in practice, Mexican courts routinely dismissed exactly such cases as the instant case for lack of competencia (referring to the power of the court to assert jurisdiction over both the parties and the subject matter of the dispute before it). Moreover, the corporations failed to offer an example of a case in which a similarly-situated defendant successfully waived competencia by answering a complaint. For these reasons, the corporations' motion to dismiss on the grounds of forum non conveniens was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty following a jury trial in 2008, of one count of murder in the first degree, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 531 and one count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony (PFDCF), Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1447A. In 2009 the state supreme court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court considered defendant's motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Delaware law, the court first had to determine whether defendant met the procedural requirements of Rule 61(i) before it could consider the merits of his postconviction relief claims. The court found that he failed to avoid the procedural bars of Rule 61(i), and that the only cause for relief from Rule 61(i)(3) was alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Although the ineffective assistance of counsel claims were not subject to the procedural default rule, defendant was not entitled to relief. He contended that his right to effective assistance of counsel was denied by one of his attorneys' attempts to withdraw, and also contended that there was a major conflict between his attorneys. The court found these arguments were unpersuasive. The record showed his attorneys represented him diligently over a number of years, and secured two reversals of convictions. At trial, both represented defendant vigorously, and there was nothing to suggest that there was any conflict between counsel. Defendant also failed to establish actual prejudice under the second prong of Strickland regarding defense counsel's decision to withdraw a request for an accomplice testimony instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured sued defendant, her insurer, to recover damages under an underinsured motorist (UIM) insurance policy. The jury awarded the insured damages. After trial, the insurer filed motions for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Del. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 50(b); or, alternatively, a new trial pursuant to Del. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 59. The insured filed a motion for costs and interest pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect; 2301(d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured's auto insurance policy provided for UIM coverage. However, the insurer elected not to provide coverage for the insured's accident. Before trial, the insured, pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect; 2301(d), offered in writing to settle her claim for the policy limit. The insurer refused. The insured's treating physician and surgeon, who was a board certified orthopedic surgeon, testified in a deposition as to the insured's injury and as to the insured's treatment and surgery for that injury. The court found that the testimony was admissible under Del. R. Evid. 702. Moreover, there was, therefore, a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find that the insured had a compensable injury. Thus, the insurer was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In addition, the jury did not go against the great weight of the evidence or disregard the applicable rules of law and the verdict was not tainted by legal error. Therefore, the insured was not entitled to a new trial. Finally, the insured was entitled to costs, under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 5101 and Del. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 54(d), and to prejudgment interest, under Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect; 2301(d).</SPAN></P>

Further, the inmate failed to meet his burden of proof as to claims that his guilty plea was coerced due to ineffective assistance of counsel, and double jeopardy. The court reviewed the plea colloquy and found that it was appropriate and that there was no coercion or ineffectiveness of counsel. The inmate failed to demonstrate that counsel's performance was unreasonable, and none of the inmate's assertions constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Although counsel and the inmate disagreed about trial strategy, the motion to suppress, and various aspects of the case, the disagreement did not constitute deficient representation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate filed a petition for postconviction relief. The motion was dismissed. The inmate appealed. The Delaware Supreme Court remanded the case to consider and rule on the inmate's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, abuse of prosecutorial discretion and &quot;contradictive and ambiguous&quot; colloquy, and ordered the superior court to expand the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate raised several claims in support of his argument he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The court rejected the inmate's claims, finding, inter alia, that defendant counsel offered the inmate professional competent assistance. Counsel considered the evidence against the inmate and counseled that a plea was in the inmate's best interest. Counsel presented a legal argument based on the statutory scheme and zealously appealed it to the supreme court. Counsel's decision not to seek a Bill of Particulars was a reasonable legal strategy. Counsel used the evidence of abuse in the inmate's family to help secure a favorable plea offer. In addition, based on the favorable plea offer, there was not a reasonable probability that but for defense counsel's alleged errors the inmate would have rejected the plea offer and gone to trial. Where there was probable cause to indict the inmate on charges of unlawfully dealing in child pornography (UDCP), the prosecutor did not abuse its discretion by charging UDCP rather than possession of child pornography (PCP). Finally, the court found that the inmate was not misled into thinking the charges were downgraded for UDCP to PCP.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered defendant's fourth Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61 postconviction motion following his 1992 convictions of robbery and murder and death sentence. A stay of habeas corpus proceedings was granted by the United States District Court for the District of Delaware so that defendant could exhaust his state law remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found defendant adduced sufficient evidence to invoke the &quot;actual innocence&quot; exception to the procedural bars of Rule 61(i)(5), as there was no forensic evidence linking him to the murder and the only evidence against him was his confession, the statement of a jail house informant, and the admission of a co-perpetrator. The court found his convictions and ensuing death penalty were constitutionally infirm. First, the chief investigating police officer did not advise the prosecutors of evidence which may have exculpated defendant, and this information was not produced to defendant's counsel, depriving defendant of due process of law. Second, the Miranda warnings given defendant prior to his only recorded interrogation not only failed to adequately convey to him his right to counsel, but may have misled him into believing he had a right to appointed counsel only if the State felt he needed one. Because the warnings given were defective, defendant's statement to the police should have been excluded. Third, the court found that defendant did not knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda rights. Therefore, the resulting statement should have been excluded from evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions and death sentence were vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Adjoining properties were condemned and demolished. It was noted that the PO's property shared a party wall with one of the condemned properties that was owned by another. An engineer's report indicated that the PO's properties were also in unsafe condition. A city building inspector entered an order of condemnation and demolition for the PO's properties, which was confirmed by the board. The PO petitioned the court for judicial review by writ of certiorari. The court noted that upon review, the board did not proceed illegally or contrary to law. Further, a sufficient record existed, and the board acted within its jurisdiction. The court found that the board and the city had authority, jurisdiction, and an obligation to condemn properties when appropriate. However, the board convened with two of the three required members. Although that was a quorum and no objections were made, the board proceeded irregularly. The city manager was a standing member of the board, and he was not replaced when a conflict of interest arose. Such constituted a violation of Milford, Del., Code ch. 88A(4), &sect; 112.7.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief alleging he was illegally detained because a trial court had no jurisdiction to sentence him due to the presence of yellow fringe on a United States flag in the courtroom. The motion was referred to a commissioner, who issued a report and recommendation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said the yellow fringe made the flag a military flag, depriving the court of jurisdiction. The claim was waived because he waived any right to raise it when he voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly entered into a guilty plea. The claim was procedurally barred by Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61(i)(2) and (3) because (1) he never objected to the flag during his plea, sentencing, or on direct appeal, and (2) he did not support his argument that his claim somehow constituted &quot;newly discovered evidence.&quot; The motion was procedurally barred under Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61(i)(4) because his claim was raised and adjudicated in his prior motion for sentence reduction/modification. His claim was without merit because (1) the fringe was not an integral part of the flag and its presence was not an unauthorized addition to the design prescribed by 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1, and (2) the fringe had nothing to do with the court's jurisdiction. Defendant did not meet an exception to the procedural bars applicable to his motion because he did not show a colorable claim that there was a miscarriage of justice or that reconsideration of the claim was warranted in the interest of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant note debtor filed a renewed motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment in an action by plaintiff note holder, alleging breach of contract, conversion, and unjust enrichment regarding the debtor's failure to pay under a one-million dollar promissory note. The holder and defendant, company-B, filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor signed the note as a managing member of company-A, which he had formed. Thereafter, the holder amended the note to change the borrower to company-B, which was wholly owned by the debtor. The payments thereunder were made for a period of years, but eventually defaulted upon when the amended note matured. The holder filed suit, alleging multiple claims against the debtor and company-B. In resolving the parties' motions, the court found that there was no cause to dismiss the action against the debtor. Due to his decades-long business of forming 22 companies in Delaware, and his serving on the boards of two of them, there was general personal jurisdiction over him under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3104(c). Further, the minimum contacts test of U.S. Const. amend. XIV was satisfied. The court found that the amended note was enforceable against company-B, but not against the debtor, based on the amendment that substituted company-B as the debtor of the note. The amended note was enforceable under Ohio's antecedent debt exception pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1303.03(A) and 1303.33(A)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the debtor's dismissal motion, and granted his motion for summary judgment. It also granted summary judgment to the note holder against company-B.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 20 did not apply to defendant, as the statute did not foreclose his right to bear arms in a manner that did not violate it, it served the substantial interest of protecting police officers lawfully within his residence, defendant had no &quot;substantial&quot; interest in carrying a concealed deadly weapon while resisting a lawful arrest, even in his home, as applying the statute in the context of a proper police response to a domestic disturbance report, outstanding capias, and belligerent suspect, even within his home, furthered a &quot;substantial&quot; State interest while impairing only a &quot;minimal&quot; private interest in carrying a concealed deadly weapon in his home while forcefully resisting a lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate, pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 4784(j), filed a petition for return of property seized in a forfeiture proceeding under the theory that it was paid for with money the inmate earned selling drugs. After a commissioner denied the inmate's petition, the inmate filed written objections, which were treated as a motion for reconsideration under Del. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 132(a)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate said respondent State did not use first class mail to send him notice, under Del. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 71.3. The reviewing court held this claim had no merit because the State sent notice by certified mail, which was a form of first class mail. The State did not have to file an in rem application because Rule 71.3 only required such an application when no petition for the return of forfeited property was made. The commissioner did not have to hear evidence linking the property seized to the sale of illegal drugs because the State alleged the inmate bought it with the proceeds of drug sales, under Del. Code Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 4784(a)(7), and sufficient evidence justified forfeiture on those grounds. It was not error for the commissioner to apply a probable cause standard because forfeitures under Del. Code Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 4784 were civil proceedings in which the State had to show probable cause for filing suit. The inmate did not show the commissioner's closed mind when the commissioner chose not to believe the inmate's evidence because the commissioner, as trier of fact, had to determine the credibility of witnesses and could choose which evidence to believe.</SPAN></P>

The State asserted that defendant's vehicle was lawfully stopped pursuant to probable cause developed during a multifaceted investigation and that judicial authorization for GPS tracking was not needed because citizens do not have a legitimate expectation of privacy regarding their travel on public highways. The court concluded that, absent exigent circumstances, the warrantless placement of a GPS device to track a suspect 24 hours a day constituted an unlawful search. While individual have a diminished expectation of privacy in their vehicles, prolonged GPS surveillance provides more information that one reasonable expects to expose to the public. In addition, the court concluded that even if there was no reasonable expectation to be free from casual encounters by others in the public sphere, society reasonably expects to be free from constant police scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court said the driver's case was handled inconsistently with others. The appellate court held the trial court abused its discretion because (1) the State's prosecutorial discretion was not reviewable, as no constitutional violation was claimed, and (2) it essentially found the driver was not an habitual offender, despite undisputed contrary evidence. It improperly relied on Del. C.P. Ct. Civ. R. 60(b) because it (1) misconstrued &quot;misrepresentation&quot; in Del. C.P. Ct. Civ. R. 60(b)(3) by finding the State misrepresented the driver's status, and (2) abused its discretion by finding the driver's record indistinguishable from others. The prior judgment could not be vacated under Del. C.P. Ct. Civ. R. 60(b)(6) because comparing the driver's record to other records showed no &quot;extraordinary circumstances.&quot; The court could not vacate its prior judgment as a sanction under Del. C.P. Ct. Civ. R. 11 because (1) no motion was filed, and (2) it entered no order to show cause. Reinstating the driver's license after a prior petition was dismissed did not bar the current petition, under equitable estoppel, because the driver did not reasonably rely on the dismissal to her detriment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed, and a prior judgment declaring the driver to be an habitual traffic offender was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police detective assisted an employee of the Department of Corrections in surveillance of defendant after receiving a tip from an informant that defendant was selling marijuana and crack cocaine. Upon investigation, it was noted that defendant was on Level 1 probation, he had multiple drug-related convictions, and he failed to report an arrest for driving during suspension. The failure to report the arrest was a technical violation of defendant's probation. Approval for an administrative search of defendant's residence was obtained. A traffic stop of a car that defendant was riding in was conducted, and due to the aroma of marijuana in the car and visible blunt shavings, the occupants were detained. Upon conducting an administrative search of defendant's residence, drugs and cash were seized. In resolving defendant's suppression motion, the court found that reasonable suspicion existed prior to conducting the administrative search for purposes of U.S. Const. amend. IV, Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, and Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4321(d). Further, as defendant had control over a purse located in a bedroom containing both men's and women's clothing, the search thereof was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor's employer received reports from pharmacies regarding the doctor's practice of writing prescriptions for patients with whom he had no doctor/patient relationship or documentation. After issuing formal reprimands, the doctor was terminated from employment. The doctor admitted that he had written illegal controlled substance prescriptions in exchange for money, and that he was addicted to Percocet. He was criminally convicted for that conduct. A panel for the Board found unprofessional conduct, and the Board adopted that finding, as well as the recommended sanction which included a bar to re-applying for licensure for a one-year period. When the doctor re-applied for licensure within five years of his convictions, it was denied by the Board pursuant to &sect; 1720(e)(4). On appeal, there was no waiver of the doctor's due process rights before the Board. However, no violation was found. The doctor had a fair hearing, the Board properly considered relevant evidence regarding the applicability of &sect; 1720(e)(4), and the presumption of honesty and integrity was not overcome.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. That conviction was reversed. His re-trial was scheduled to start with jury selection. Defendant moved to have the judge from his first trial recuse himself from presiding over the re-trial. He argued, inter alia, that as the judge sentenced him to death, and it was still a capital case, that fact should weigh heavily in favor of recusal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reversing defendant's convictions and sentences, the Delaware Supreme Court held that defendant had received ineffective assistance of counsel because he wanted to plead not guilty, but they pursued, over his objections, a defense of guilty, but mentally ill. The Supreme Court also held that the trial court had not protected defendant's rights when it permitted his counsel to pursue that defense over his objection and by not resolving at trial the differences between defendant and counsel. The judge determined that he was free of bias and prejudice against defendant. As defendant's plea in the upcoming trial was not guilty, many issues not raised or questions asked at his first trial would be raised and asked at his second trial. The judge would operate with a clean slate. The new jury would have to hear the evidence and decide if he was guilty or not guilty. The judge found there was not an objective appearance of bias or prejudice. The issues before and during the new trial could be handled without bias or the appearance of bias. The Supreme Court's decision involved an issue of constitutional dimension and not of the judge's interaction on a personal level with defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant prisoner filed a motion for postconviction relief. His attorneys argued that the prisoner's opposing a full mitigation case was legally unimportant, and the prisoner's trial lawyers were ineffective for not handling the records better and not insisting on more testing. The prisoner offered new mitigators, such as evidence that he suffered from &quot;mild&quot; brain damage attributable to alleged childhood head traumas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner, a habitual offender, admitted beating and strangling his pregnant girlfriend, then mutilating her body. Preferring death over life in prison, he adamantly opposed his lawyers' presenting a mitigation case at his penalty phase. Nevertheless, his lawyers employed a psychiatrist and others to look for mitigating evidence. They examined his background and records. The prisoner contended that had the full picture been revealed, presumably including the new non-statutory aggravators of sadism, animal cruelty, bullying and fire setting, as well as the new alleged mitigators of mild brain damage, the prisoner would not be under a death sentence. The court held that to the extent that trial counsel did not provide records to the doctors before they did their evaluations, that was due more to the records not being available and less to trial counsel's having been derelict. While some experts would have preferred to have had the then-unavailable records, they largely stood by their pretrial opinions. The psychiatrist still believed the prisoner was dangerous and incorrigible. There was also reason to believe that the prisoner exaggerated and skewed his story to his advantage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, two out-of-state Roman Catholic dioceses and a Maryland parish and school, filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction in consolidated actions by plaintiff congregants, alleging that they were sexually abused by priests employed by the religious entities. One congregant filed a motion for leave to take discovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The actions arose from alleged sexual abuse of the congregants when they were young. Defendants sought dismissal on the grounds that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. The court initially consolidated the two pending actions for purposes of the dismissal motions, and it noted that consideration of affidavits generally was appropriate. However, consideration of affidavits by an expert that touched upon ecclesiastical matters was precluded under the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine of the Establishment Clause of U.S. Const. amend. 1 and under the Equal Protection Clause. As the discovery sought related to facts which were undisputed for purposes of the dismissal motions, the proposed discovery was unnecessary. The court determined that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendants. The priests' conduct was not within the scope of employment for purposes of respondeat superior liability of defendants under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3104(c). Further, defendants' conduct did not subject them to either general or specific personal jurisdiction under &sect; 3104(c)(4) or (c)(1) or (3), and there was no jurisdiction under the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motions by the dioceses, the parish, and the school to dismiss. It denied the motion for leave to take discovery.</SPAN></P>

P. 61 motion for postconviction relief seeking a new penalty phase of his murder trial; defendant claimed, inter alia, that his defense and appellate counsel were constitutionally ineffective, that his due process rights were violated, and that the trial court erred in instructing the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After two burglars crashed through the glass patio doors of the victim's home, they struggled with the victim and shot him four times in the neck and head, killing him almost instantly. At the penalty phase of his trial, the defense presented testimony from eight witnesses as well as from defendant himself. The prosecutor concluded his cross-examination by asking whether defendant had ever seen The Jerry Springer Show. The trial court's instructed the jury not to be swayed by &quot;mere sympathy&quot; in considering the mitigating evidence. The appellate court found, inter alia, that additional lay and expert witnesses or further investigation into defendant's mental condition would have added little to the jury's understanding of defendant's life. Defendant was not prejudiced by the mitigating evidence as it was planned and presented by his trial attorneys. While the prosecutor's remark might not have been the most seemly way to end his cross-examination, it did not rise to the level of a due process violation. Finally, the trial court's sympathy instruction was proper. Therefore, defendant was not entitled to Rule 61 relief.</SPAN></P>

The city acted within its authority to enact the vacancy ordinances in question for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens. The ordinances did not amount to a bill of attainder since the assessment was not penal or criminal, and administrative and judicial review was available for those allegedly harmed by the city's actions. Pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 25, &sect; 2901(a)(1)(j), a lien was automatically placed on real estate once the vacancy assessments were issued. Therefore, regardless whether the property was currently occupied, the owners were still responsible for past vacancy assessments on the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant police sergeant filed a motion for summary judgment in plaintiff inmate's personal injury action; the sergeant claimed that he was not aware of the inmate's prior ankle injury until after the contact between them, and that there was no effort to injure the inmate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the inmate and his fellow inmates allegedly disobeyed a facility rule, they were shackled together and led to an area for discipline purposes. While standing in the discipline area, the inmate's previously injured right foot was raised in the air most of the time, his left foot, however, never left its proper place. While apparently inspecting the inmates, the sergeant swung his foot towards the inmate's injured foot. The inmate claimed that he was kicked. The sergeant claimed that he just slid the inmate's foot into the proper position. Thereafter, it was determined that one of the surgical screws in the inmate's foot was broken. The court found, inter alia, that jury questions existed as to whether the force used was reasonable and moderate, and as to whether the sergeant's use of force was excessive and as to his credibility concerning his Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 468 justification defense. Although the inmate failed to comply with Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3103(c) and Del. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 4(j), the failure was excusable. Therefore, the inmate was entitled to a 60-day enlargement of time under Del. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 6(b) to serve the attorney general.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an alleged assault victim (AAV), filed suit against defendants, various church entities, arising from the alleged sexual abuse that the AAV suffered from a priest when he was a child. The action was brought pursuant to the Child Victim's Act, Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8145. Defendants sought summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The AAV filed suit under the Child Victim's Act against multiple defendants, who sought summary judgment. The court noted that a reverend who served as a Provincial for a particular province had not served in that capacity until 24 years after the alleged abuse took place. Accordingly, he could not have directed, ordered, ratified, approved, or consented to the alleged abuse that took place, such that he was entitled to summary judgment as to the claims against him. Further, as there was no respondeat superior liability under the Act, claims against the church entities under such a theory warranted a grant of summary judgment in their favor. A breach of fiduciary duty claim was an equitable one within the jurisdiction of the court of chancery. As the Act did not revive claims involving intentional torts, such as fraud, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting, those claims were time-barred under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8106. Lastly, the court found that there was no due process violation under either U.S. Const. amend. XIV or the Delaware Constitution by the revival of certain child abuse cases under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied summary judgment with respect to defendants' constitutionality claim. The remainder of the summary judgment motion was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed motions to dismiss their respective criminal indictments, charging them each with operation of a motor vehicle causing death (OMVCD), in violation of Del.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It had previously been held that &sect; 4176A imposed strict liability for deaths proximately caused by a moving violation of the Delaware Motor Vehicle Code, and that &sect; 4176A was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendants were each charged with OMVCD, and they sought dismissal on the grounds that &sect; 4176A imposed an unconstitutionally excessive punishment. The court found no basis to dismiss the charges. It held that the Delaware General Assembly acted within its power in establishing the punishment provision delineated in &sect; 4176A. Further, the court held that the punishment provision was not unconstitutionally excessive. The potential sentence of up to 30 months' imprisonment fell within the sentencing parameters of an unclassified misdemeanor pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4206(c), such that it was consistent with Delaware law. There was no violation of due process under the United States Constitution and under Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 by the punishment imposed, as it was &quot;relatively small&quot; and a conviction did not impart grave damage to a defendant's reputation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners landowners filed petitions for writs of certiorari seeking review of decisions of respondent Board of Adjustment of the City of Newark, Delaware (board), that a non-conforming use of the landowners' property as a fraternity house ceased upon a university's suspension of the property's occupant's right to operate as a fraternity, and that the property's subsequent lease to another fraternity did not preserve the non-conforming use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the fraternity was suspended, the city notified the owners that the non-conforming use expired. The owners said Newark, Delaware, Zoning Code &sect; 32-51(b), terminating the use upon the suspension, delegated a legislative function to the university. The ordinance delegated no such function as the university made no zoning decision when it suspended the fraternity. The suspension's zoning consequences did not make the suspension an exercise of the city's legislative function. The owners were not denied a property interest without due process, as they presented their claims to the board and were not entitled to argue to the board that the fraternity did not violate the university's rules, as the board could not veto the university's decision. The owners did not show they could not participate in the suspension proceedings. The ordinance did not require the fraternity's suspension by its national organization. The owners' lease of the property to another fraternity within one year of the suspension did not preserve the non-conforming use because the ordinance said, in the case of fraternities and sororities, such use expired immediately upon a suspension.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the officer had the requisite reasonable suspicion and probable cause to stop and arrest defendant under the Fourth Amendment and Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, based on his observations of defendant's driving, crossing the fog lines, twice nearly striking the curb, and over correcting. The court also held that the phlebotomist's blood sample taken was reasonable even though it was taken at the police station. However, because the arresting officer unambiguously informed defendant of the one year driving penalty after defendant verbally stated his refusal to submit to blood testing, the sample taken did not conform to the statutory standards under Delaware law. While defendant did submit to, or at least did not physically resist, the blood test, he maintained his general unwillingness and refusal to submit to the testing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with multiple offenses and he sought suppression. The court found that the traffic stop was valid. Further, it found that defendant consented to the search. It noted that federal courts allowed the police to ask for consent to search during a simple traffic stop, despite not having reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The court found that in the circumstances, such a request was valid and not violative of U.S. Const. amend. IV.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his motion, defendant claimed: (1) he was actually innocent, (2) all of his pre-trial or trial counsel had various conflicts of interest, (3) the State withheld exculpatory evidence in violation of Brady, (4) the sentencing judge improperly relied on a &quot;secret&quot; psychological/psychiatric report, (5) his trial counsel failed to properly investigate his brain damage, (6) the court denied him of his right to an impartial jury, (7) the State suppressed evidence that a certain witness was a State agent, (8) the State made improper remarks during the examination of one of its witnesses and during its closing argument, (9) the State failed to comply with the Delaware Administrative Procedures Act when it promulgated Delaware's lethal injection execution policies, and (10) he was innocent of felony murder as a matter of law. The court cited the Delaware Supreme Court's statement that defendant's trial resulted in a verdict worthy of confidence. His claims for relief, which were all procedurally barred under Rule 61 or otherwise did not entitle him to relief, did not undermine the instant court's confidence in that verdict.</SPAN></P>

The officer then handcuffed defendant, placed him in the back seat of the patrol car, searched the vehicle, and found drugs in the locked glove box. The court determined that the initial traffic stop was valid because the officer had probable cause to believe that defendant had violated the noise abatement statute. However, the traffic stop was extended into an investigative detention and search that exceeded the justifying purpose of the stop because (1) the court found that the stop was initiated to issue a citation or a warning, not to effectuate an arrest, (2) the officer had already confirmed the validity of defendant's documentation and thereby completed all activities reasonably related to a traffic stop to cite or warn for noise abatement, and (3) the State did not identify any independent facts supporting the search or the extended &quot;second&quot; detention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arresting officers testified that: they followed defendant because they were trying to figure out what the car's vanity plate meant; they pulled defendant over after they discovered that the license plate frame partially obscured the car's registration sticker; they decided to verify defendant's license, registration, and proof of insurance card; they arrested defendant after determining that the car's insurance policy was no longer valid; they obtained a search warrant after an initial inventory search of the car was conducted; and crack cocaine was later found in the glove compartment. Defendant argued that the traffic stop was pretextual and violated Del. Const. art.

The court did not address whether either defendant was entitled to sovereign immunity under Del. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On March 8, 2005, the doctor allegedly misread the patient's mammogram and stated that it was normal.

On October 24, 2007, the patient filed a complaint, accompanied by the affidavit of merit from a competent medical professional as required by Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 6853. The court determined that the continuous negligent treatment doctrine could not extend the statute of limitations. However, summary judgment was inappropriate because genuine issues of material fact existed as to the date on which defendants' alleged breach of the standard of care proximately caused injury to the patient, and the date on which her statutory cause of action for medical negligence accrued, since (1) based on the impact of &sect; 6853 upon Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 6856, the statute of limitations began to run as of the first date upon which the patient could have submitted an affidavit of merit that satisfied all statutory requisites, and (2) the patient's expert averred that he could not have sworn out an affidavit of merit earlier than November 1, 2005, the earliest date that her breast cancer metastasized, as found by the expert.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate filed a pro se motion for postconviction relief following his conviction of three counts of first degree murder, one count of first degree robbery, one count of second degree arson, and related weapons and conspiracy charges. On the murder charges, the inmate was sentenced to three life sentences without the possibility of parole or any other sentence reduction. The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed his convictions and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although many of the inmate's postconviction claims were procedurally barred, the court addressed them to determine whether the inmate could show cause or prejudice. Among other things, the court concluded that the inmate's speedy trial claim lacked merit, as the reasons for the over four-year delay were mostly attributable to the inmate, who asked for new counsel, or to a constitutionally mandated stay. Although the inmate's incarceration itself was inherently prejudicial, the inmate offered no specific evidence or facts to show his defense was impaired. The inmate's claim of a Brady violation failed, as the inmate failed to show that either he or counsel requested a videotape of 12 hours of interrogation not offered at trial. The inmate's many claims of ineffective assistance of counsel also failed under the Strickland standard. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to allegedly false information in the affidavit of probable cause for his arrest warrant, as both the grand jury and the court determined that there was probable cause to arrest the inmate. Nor was counsel ineffective for failing to call an alibi witness, as the inmate failed to show he had a viable alibi.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate motion for postconviction relief was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of incidents involving three jurors during his 2001 capital murder trial, defendant asked for permission to conduct an ex parte interview of all jurors. He also argued that if he could not, the professional conduct rule prohibiting him from doing so, Del Law. R. Prof. Conduct 3.5(c), violated his federal and state constitutional rights to a fair trial (the Sixth Amendment and Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 7) and free speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Delaware Supreme Court had since 1980 invoked Del. R. Evid. 606(b) as a basis to allow post-trial judicially conducted or supervised examination of jurors. That rule was the only rule known regulating examination of jurors. The court found that the phrase &quot;except as provided by court rule&quot; in Del. Law. R. Prof. Conduct 3.5(c) encompassed, at a minimum, Del. R. Evid. 606(b) and its interpretations by the Supreme Court. Therefore Rule 3.5(c) operated to preserve defendant's right to a fair trial and an impartial jury as secured by the Sixth Amendment and Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Without presenting anything new since the trial, the 2001 record did not support a basis for further examination of jurors, ex parte or otherwise. The court found that defendant's showing fell far short of the mark of good cause to explore under judicial auspices in a courtroom proceeding possible extraneous influences. The record needed no further exploration or expansion. If further examination were undertaken and even though not in a trial setting, there was a legitimate concern of harassment and even creating a public atmosphere of unwillingness to serve, especially in capital cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's constitutional challenges to Rule 3.5(c) were denied. Defendant's motion for leave to permit his counsel to contact the jurors was denied.</SPAN></P>

The property owners alternately argued that if the fees were valid, the properties satisfied the conditions necessary to obtain waivers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Licenses and Inspections issued vacant building registration assessment fees to the property. Subsequently, the property owners appealed and submitted a request for waiver of the assessment fees, which was denied by the Commissioner of Licenses and Inspections. The parties appeared at a hearing before the Board where a property owner moved for the recusal of the Board Chairman on the ground that he was biased. The motion for recusal was denied. In addition, the Board did not find merit in the arguments that the properties were not vacant or that the fees were illegal. The court held that some of the property owners arguments were only summarily addressed as having been previously decided and denied in earlier hearings on the same issues. The court found that the property owners presented no new evidence or arguments that would warrant recusal of the Chairman. As such, they failed to show the Board proceeded illegally or manifestly contrary to law. There was nothing to suggest the Board's actions were an error of law or that the proceedings were conducted irregularly. Their writ of certiorari on the issues had to be denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was mainly engaged in the development, manufacture, assembly, marketing, and sale of motor vehicles, as well as motor vehicle parts. Although incorporated in Delaware, its principal place of business was in Michigan. The company did not sell its products directly but to independent dealerships, including 11 in Delaware. The company was considered a &quot;wholesaler of goods&quot; under Del. Code Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 2902. Under that provision, any entity falling within that definition and engaged in &quot;wholesaling&quot; had to pay a licensing fee for each such Delaware facility and a tax on the gross receipts from Delaware wholesale sales. The company claimed entitlement to a wholesaler gross receipt refund on taxes that it had paid under that statute. The Director denied the claim. The trial court found that (1) substantial evidence in the record supported the ruling that the company engaged in wholesaling activities subject to Del. Code Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 2902's gross receipts tax, (2) the Director did not commit legal error in reaching that result, and (3) neither that statute nor its imposition violated the federal Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former student was allegedly subjected to continuous sexual abuse by defendant teacher, mostly occurring in Delaware. Later, Delaware enacted Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8145, permitting childhood sexual abuse victims a two-year window to file civil suits otherwise barred on limitations grounds. The first religious corporation, second religious corporation, and academy sought dismissal of his lawsuit based on, respectively, a claim that the statute was unconstitutional, lack of personal jurisdiction, and on res judicata grounds. The trial court found that (1) the statute did not violate the due process clauses of the Delaware or United States Constitutions because it resurrected a lost remedy rather than destroyed a vested right, (2) personal jurisdiction existed over the second religious corporation, a Wisconsin corporation, because it provided services in Delaware and had done so for decades, which meant it had minimum contacts with Delaware and the exercise of personal jurisdiction would not be unreasonable, and (3) a separate, earlier action regarding sexual abuse during ski trips to Vermont involved four incidents and not the 230 instances of alleged abuse in Delaware.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. tit 11, &sect; 423, or raise it before the court was unavailing; (3) counsel was not ineffective for failing to seek dismissal of the indictment based on defendant's name change; (4) Del.

Defendant received a life sentence and did not seek to withdraw his plea at any time prior to or after sentencing. More than one year after his conviction became final, he filed a pro se motion for postconviction relief that raised four grounds for relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court found that under Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61(i)(5), his postconviction motion was not time barred because he raised colorable claims of a constitutional violation. However, the trial court also found that defendant did not show that his counsel performed in an objectively unreasonable manner in advising defendant to accept the State's offer of life in prison in order to avoid the possibility of a death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer paid the Delaware corporate franchise tax pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 503 and was considered a wholesaler of goods for Del. Code Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 2902 purposes. The director sought to impose the tax on grounds that the manufacturer delivered goods to a foreign buyer at its warehouse in Delaware. The court found that, because the sale was consummated outside of Delaware and title had passed before the goods were delivered in Delaware, the tax placed an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The sales constituted interstate commerce and were consummated outside Delaware. Del. Code Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 2902 was internally consistent, but it was not externally consistent. Title to and ownership of the goods was determinative. The ownership of the products sold and destined for delivery in Delaware was transferred from the manufacturer before the goods entered Delaware. The buyer designated that the goods were to be physically delivered in Delaware. The local taxable event had occurred; however, the tax could not be imposed pursuant to &sect; 2902, and the manufacturer was not the party to be taxed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that his appellate counsel was ineffective because the Supreme Court of Delaware, in its opinion on defendant's appeal, discussed issues that counsel either did not raise on appeal or argued incorrectly on appeal. He further argued that Del.

The court found that defendant failed to prove that his counsel's decisions not to make arguments fell below an objective standard of reasonableness or that arguments on issues would have changed the appellate ruling. Moreover, defendant failed to prove that appellate counsel's decision fell below an objective standard of reasonableness or that he was prejudiced as a result of counsel's strategic decisions. Finally, defendant was not entitled to the appointment of counsel under Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61(e)(1) because he failed to meet the good cause standard as none of the arguments he raised satisfied the burden imposed on him to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate sought to have &sect; 4209 declared unconstitutional. The court noted that the capital sentencing scheme under &sect;&nbsp;4209 was a &quot;hybrid system,&quot; wherein the jury's determinations on punishment were used only as a recommendation, with the trial court judge making the ultimate sentencing determination. Based on the post-Ring 2002 amendments to &sect; 4209, the jury's role during the penalty phase of the capital case was transformed from one that were merely advisory to one that was determinative as to the existence of any statutory aggravating circumstances. The trial court judge, however, still retained the ultimate sentencing decision. The court concluded that &sect; 4209 withstood constitutional challenge under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Further, the method of execution by lethal injection was also constitutionally upheld. The inmate's argument that application of the death penalty to his matter should be precluded due to the pendency of federal litigation was deemed premature and was reviewable later, if necessary.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff real estate developers and their trade association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public service commission was faced with a problem because utilities were generating rate case and rate increases too often, primarily because they were under-collecting water expansion costs as new homes needing water service were built. The public service commission then went through an extensive regulatory process and determined there were three things that needed to be worked on. The solution, it concluded, was to first, mandate that all direct costs for expanded water service, on-site and off, be paid by real estate developers. Second, it decided that a fixed fee would be imposed for new residential water service; the fee would cover costs indirectly associated with providing water to new housing. Accordingly, it put a revised water utility regulation into effect. The real estate developers and their trade association appealed. On appeal, the trial court found that the public service commission had the authority under the Public Utilities of 1974, Del. Code Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 101 et seq., to make rates that were in the best interests of the utilities' customers and it determined an approach to that effect, even if the approach may not have represented the perfect solution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grand jury indicted defendant on two counts related to a traffic accident: operation of a vehicle causing death, Del. Code tit. 21, &sect; 4176A, (Count 1), and lane change when prohibited, Del. Code tit. 21, &sect; 4122, (Count 2). Defendant filed a motion to declare &sect; 4176A&nbsp;unconstitutional or, in the alternative, for an order requiring the State to prove that defendant acted intentionally, knowingly or recklessly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and violative of due process because it did not specify or define the state of mind sufficient for commission of the crime; it appeared to impose strict liability, but did not clearly evince a legislative intent to do so; and it imposed severe felony-like sentences for a misdemeanor. The court determined that &sect; 4176A was unconstitutionally vague; a person of ordinary intelligence did not have fair notice that he would have been held liable when his action resulted in any violation of the motor vehicle code and was a proximate cause of the death of another. The predicate offense involved a violation only when the driver failed to ascertain that a lane change could have been made with safety. Because of such considerations, a &sect; 4176A violation was imprecise, failing to give ordinary persons legitimate warning that such activities could bring about the criminal liability sought by the State. Defendant did not know his conduct ran afoul of anything, because he had no idea that his lane change was not safe--the object causing actual danger was not reasonably ascertainable in a timely fashion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion on each of defendant's positions.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4176A&nbsp;unconstitutionally authorized criminal punishment for ordinary negligence and strict liability offenses. The statute was not unconstitutional because the general assembly intended to exclude it from the culpability requirements in Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 251(c). If &sect; 251(c) applied, criminal negligence would be the lowest level of culpability the State would have to prove in a prosecution under Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4176A, but criminally negligent homicide was already a crime when &sect; 4176A was enacted. Section 4176A was not unconstitutional without a culpability requirement because legislatures could criminalize conduct in the absence of criminal intent. It did not violate due process to punish a person for committing a crime related to the public welfare even when the person had no knowledge of facts making the act criminal. A violation of &sect; 4176A was an unclassified misdemeanor so any possible damage to an offender's reputation did not rise to an unacceptable level, as the United States and Delaware Constitutions let the general assembly impose criminal penalties of the magnitude at issue with a showing of ordinary negligence.</SPAN></P>

The officer witnessed defendant violate Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4146(c), when defendant walked eastbound in an eastbound lane. The officer's subjective intent at the time of the stop was irrelevant because the officer had probable cause to believe defendant committed a pedestrian violation. As to the pat-down of defendant, which involved handcuffing and questioning, defendant was in custody for purposes of Miranda subsequent to being placed in handcuffs, because there was a restraint on his freedom of movement to the degree associated with a formal arrest. Therefore, the officer should have given defendant his Miranda warnings before asking defendant if had drugs on his person. Defendant's answer, &quot;Yes,&quot; could not be introduced as evidence. However, the officer was justified under the Fourth Amendment to handcuff and pat-down defendant, and the drugs found as a result of the pat-down are admissible. Finally, defendant's argument that &sect;&nbsp;4146(c) was unconstitutionally vague failed.</SPAN></P>

The issue was whether the tint on the windows gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that the tint was a motor vehicle equipment violation, thus justifying the stop. The court determined that it did, rejecting defendant's contention that an officer had to look at the windows from the inside out before the officer could be reasonably suspicious that an equipment violation had occurred. The State's contention that a reasonable suspicion of a violation arose where an officer could not see the occupants in the vehicle, was more persuasive. Also, nothing within Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4313(a), limited it to enforcement as a secondary violation. Window tint that was so dark an officer could not see the occupants inside the vehicle created a reasonable suspicion that the tint violated the statute and the 70% light transmission standard found in a regulation adopted by the Delaware Department of Transportation, Division of Motor Vehicles. Finally, contrary to defendant's contention, &sect; 4313 was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion was procedurally barred as it was filed 26 years after the final order of conviction was issued. Moreover, five of the six claims were procedurally barred because defendant never raised them in a prior postconviction proceeding, at trial, or on direct appeal. Defendant also had not shown cause for failing to raise those claims at a prior postconviction proceeding or that there was a substantial likelihood that the outcome of his case would have been different had the issues been raised. The claim that his due process rights were violated due to the prosecution's improper use of peremptory challenges to strike black jurors was procedurally barred under Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61(i)(4) where it had been formerly adjudicated in another case and he failed to show that the challenge had to be heard in the interest of justice. Defendant could not avail himself of Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61(i)(5) as to the remaining procedurally barred claims. For example, there was no independent support for his claim that the prosecutor was not licensed to practice law, and there were no facts indicating that a lesser included offense jury instruction was necessary.</SPAN></P>

Alternatively, it alleged that the tax violated both the Commerce and Due Process Clauses. But the tax covered all the bank's business activities relating to mortgages on the bank's books in the State of Delaware, and not the bank's activities through its subsidiary in Colorado, the decision-making in New York, or the interest earned while the mortgages were in New York. Hence, it was properly assessed. As to the constitutional arguments, the bank failed to show that the tax was not fairly apportioned or that no rational relationship existed between the tax and the income. Also, the bank failed to prepare a separate Delaware balance sheet accounting for the money earned in Delaware. Second, nothing showed that the tax was duplicative. Third, because the bank was not headquartered in Delaware, it was not entitled to use separate accounting under Del. Code Ann. tit. 5, &sect; 1101(b), and no evidentiary error resulted from the exclusion of the bank's expert testimony or the denial of the use of the separate accounting methodology presented by its accountants. Finally, the Commissioner properly refused to abate the bank's taxes or penalties.</SPAN></P>

The court analyzed Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 and held that purely pretextual stops ran afoul of the underlying purpose of the provision of preventing unreasonable searches and seizures. The court found that the evidence was sufficient that the officer possessed the probable cause necessary to effectuate the traffic stop of defendant but that defendant met his burden of showing that another purpose, unrelated to the traffic offense, motivated the stop. The officer's hunch that defendant was involved with the drug activity at the location he was attempting to serve the warrants was insufficient to support a finding of reasonable suspicion as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

Second, because he parked in a handicapped space. The court held the evidence revealed that the officer activated his lights before defendant pulled into the handicapped parking place, thereby eliminating the parking location as a basis for the stop. The officer testified that he stopped defendant because the windows concealed the occupants of the vehicle. The officer subsequently admitted that such was not the legal standard.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant employer filed a motion to dismiss the complaint filed by plaintiff, the Workers' Compensation Fund. The Fund brought a complaint against the employer for a writ of prohibition and/or for declaratory judgment with regard to the employer's action for reimbursement from the Fund.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer sought reimbursement from the Fund because one of its employees suffered a subsequent permanent injury while working for it. When an employee suffered a subsequent permanent injury and became totally disabled, the Fund became liable for total disability benefits. However, the Fund argued before the Board that the employer's claim was filed beyond the applicable statute of limitations. The Board rejected the Fund's argument and set the matter down for a hearing on the issues surrounding the total disability claim and on the issue of reimbursement, and the Fund filed the underlying complaint. The court held that it was imprudent to issue the writ which the Fund sought since the determination of when the statute of limitations began to run involved factual or other matters which might be in dispute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case arising from the alleged harassment of plaintiff church member by defendant pastor, plaintiff sued defendants, the church corporation, a bishop, and an individual church (church defendants), for negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Before the court was the church defendants' motion for summary judgment (Superior Court Civil Rule 56).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the member's claims invoked the church's disciplinary book. Therefore, the court's adjudication of the claims would necessarily involve an inquiry into the propriety of the decisions of church authorities on matters of discipline, internal organization, ecclesiastical rule, custom, and law. This was exactly the inquiry that the First Amendment prohibited. The church defendants would be compelled to defend as reasonable its formal internal processing and handling of the member's claims. Every step the church took to respond and react to the claims would be reviewed to determine whether it was reasonable. Such an inquiry into whether the church exercised reasonable care would involve, by necessity, discovery and examination by litigation of the church's disciplinary procedures and subsequent responses. In addition, the consideration of the member's claim that the bishop did not take any action against the member after an investigative committee had determined that he violated the disciplinary book was barred by the First Amendment. Adjudication of the member's claims would ultimately involve an examination of the church tribunal's decision-making process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a town, its mayor, managers, and Board of Elections (town), moved for dismissal of an action filed by plaintiff mayoral candidate (candidate) pursuant to Del.

In the alternative, the candidate moved for certiorari review of the Board's decision certifying the incumbent as the winner of the election. The town also moved for a protective order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds that (1) Del. Code Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 5941 did not apply to elections other than a Wilmington, Delaware election; (2) the common law writ of quo warranto was the sole avenue to challenge election results; and (3) the only proper defendant under the candidate's &sect; 5941 claim was the incumbent, and declared winner of the election. The town also moved for a protective order to prevent discovery if the petition for certiorari was granted. As there was nothing unusual about the circumstances before the court, it held that the candidate had no remedy under title 15. As he simply asserted an irregularity in the handling of absentee ballots, writs of quo warranto and certiorari were not available remedies either. Further, the home rule enabling statute permitted qualifying municipalities to assume all powers which, under the Delaware Constitution , it would be competent for the General Assembly to grant by specific enumeration and which were not denied by statute. Hence, the candidate had no cause of action under Delaware election law. As a result, a protective order was moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;DEFENDANT'S SECOND RULE 61 MOTION FOR POSTCONVICTION RELIEF. DENIED.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, previously sentenced to death after conviction of murder, presented a second amended petition for post-conviction relief, arguing primarily that counsel had been ineffective in investigating a change in defense theory, that the burden of proof applied to weighing factors under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209 was unconstitutional, and that the trial judge had improper contact with jurors after they made their sentencing recommendations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant originally told police he shot the victim by accident, but by the time he had counsel, he was claiming that a second shooter was present at the killing. Defendant changed back to his original story at the last minute. Nonetheless, the court held that trial counsel had been properly found, by the first postconviction court, to have provided excellent representation even as it became necessary to prepare a completely new defense. Regardless of references to other standards, it was clear that the first postconviction court had properly applied the Strickland standard, so the claim could not be relitigated. Defendant's arguments that having a judge weigh aggravating and mitigating factors under a preponderance of the evidence violated Ring v. Arizona were meritless both because Ring did not apply retroactively on collateral review and because the statutory weighing process was separate from the jury's fact finding, which applied a reasonable doubt standard. Finally, defendant's argument that the trial judge's visit with jurors, thanking them for their service, after they recommended death, but not unanimously, was both untimely raised and meritless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff seller and defendant buyer entered into an asset purchase agreement whereby defendant guarantor was to acquire most of the seller's assets. Pursuant to section 8.1 of the contract allowing it to terminate that agreement if it believed in good faith that the transaction could result in material asbestos liability, the buyer did so. The seller then sued, and this matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented in the instant action was whether the buyer properly terminated the contract under Section 8.1(c)(iii)(B)(2), a provision which allowed them to do so in good faith. After analyzing the buyer's actions, the court found that the buyer's decision to terminate was made in good faith. Analysis of asbestos liability required expertise and the buyer acted appropriately in seeking counsel who appeared to have that expertise, providing him with the best available information. The legal advice that was provided to the buyer, though objectively unreasonable, caused it to doubt the application of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 to the channeling injunction and to attach unwarranted significance to the financial status of the asbestos disease claims trust. That advice, and the insistence from one of its general counsel that without the protection of the 1994 Act there was a risk of successor liability, gave the buyer a basis in law to terminate the agreement. Further, when it was discovered that the trust had a moratorium in place, and that its financial condition appeared precarious, the buyer had a basis in fact for the decision to terminate the agreement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his motion for a judgment of acquittal was denied, defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and two counts of possession of a deadly weapon or ammunition by a person prohibited.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that (1) the Assistant Medical Examiner's testimony was insufficient under Del.

The court disagreed. First, while &sect; 4707 referenced the terms &quot;reasonable medical certainty&quot; in the context of a medical examiner's written report, it made no mention of, nor had it ever been applied to, trial testimony. While probable cause had been established as the standard for medical examiners, certainty had never been required. Thus, the statute did not apply. Second, while it was undisputed that defendant was entitled to instructions on lesser included offenses, he chose not to have the jury consider any such instructions. Finally, the prosecutor's comments referenced an undisputed fact established by defendant's own testimony. Also, defendant identified no substantial rights that were jeopardized by the prosecutor's remarks. Hence, no plain error resulted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon her conviction of one count of first-degree robbery, one count of aggravated menacing, and two counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, defendant was sentenced as an habitual offender as to the robbery and firearm charges. The convictions were affirmed on appeal, and defendant timely moved for postconviction relief. This matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant set forth five grounds for relief. However, her first four claims could have been raised on appeal and, thus, were procedurally barred pursuant to Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61(i)(3). Further, a review of the evidence did not yield any cause for relief from the procedural bar, and no prejudice was shown. Defendant's final claim was based upon four allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. First, an argument essentially based upon the sufficiency and weight of the evidence was not raised on appeal. Hence, it was procedurally barred. However, there was an overwhelming amount of evidence against defendant to support the jury's verdict, even though her fingerprints were not found at the crime scene. Eyewitnesses identified defendant's car as the one used to commit the crimes, and after police searched that car, they found a gun and articles of clothing that witnesses identified as being worn by the robber. Also, the jury made a determination that the gun that the police found in that car was the one that she used in the robbery. Finally, despite these results, the court failed to find any fault in how defense counsel handled his representation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner tenant filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to respondent Justice of Peace Court (Delaware) and housing authority; the tenant claimed that because the authority did not send out a seven-day notice as required by Del. Code Ann. tit. 25, &sect; 5513, the court erred in granting possession of a subsidized rental unit to the authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant signed a lease for a three-bedroom subsidized public housing unit with the housing authority. Shortly after moving in with her three children, the children's father enforced a custody order and removed them. As a result, the authority issued a 60-day termination notice to the tenant. The authority alleged that without her children, the tenant no longer met the eligibility requirements for public housing. In addition, she did not report a change in her family composition, there had been multiple complaints about the tenant or her guests, and it was alleged that illegal activities took place in or directly outside of the residence. The appellate court held that although a writ of certiorari was the only means to have the Justice of the Peace Court's decision reviewed for the tenant, she never raised the issue that she was not given proper notice under &sect; 5513 in either of the Justice of the Peace trials. The case was not one of &quot;grave public policy or interest&quot; and did not address a constitutional issue. Consequently, the tenant was not entitled to a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party, a North Carolina resident, was seriously injured in North Carolina by a rifle manufactured in New York. The manufacturer was incorporated in Delaware. Under North Carolina's statute of repose, the injured party's claim expired a year before he was hurt. Under Delaware's statute of limitations, however, the injured party had two years after his injury to file suit, which he did in the nick of time. The court found that the injured party's cause of action arose either in New York, where the defective rifle was manufactured, or in North Carolina, where the injured party lived, bought the rifle, and was injured. Delaware's only tie was the fact of the manufacturer's incorporation. Pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8121 (1999), it was not against Delaware's public policy to borrow North Carolina's statute of repose. No vested or accrued right was at issue. The outcome of the &quot;most significant relationship test&quot; clearly called for application of North Carolina's statute of repose, even if it left the injured party without a right and a remedy. Consequently, the manufacturer was entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) and removed her case to the Delaware Court of Common Pleas. The State appealed a decision of the trial court dismissing the DUI charge. Defendant's motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the dismissal was proper as the Delaware State Chemist was not present to testify. The appellate court held that the evidence of defendant's blood alcohol content was to come from an intoxilyzer reading, not a blood test. The State Chemist was not a necessary witness for the introduction of intoxilyzer results under Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4177(h). State v. McGuire properly held that Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4177(h) did not apply to intoxilyzer cases, that the State Chemist was not involved in the chain of custody, and that the State Chemist was not a necessary witness. Defendant's request that the State Chemist testify was based on a misplaced reliance on Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect;&nbsp;4332. Section 4332 did not relate to a DUI charge based on alcohol. The Delaware legislature deliberately omitted the word &quot;breath&quot; in &sect; 4177(h). Thus, defendant's request could not serve as a basis for requiring the State to have the State Chemist at trial. Nor did Del. C.P. Ct. Crim. R. 16 require the State to have the State Chemist at trial. Finally, defendant made no showing of detrimental reliance on an alleged plea agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The court found that appellant's due process rights were not violated by the admission of the victim's testimonial statement in lieu of her appearance at the hearing because the HO properly determined that the victim was not qualified to testify under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 3516(b)(2)(a3). Moreover, the due process requirement of creating a procedure only applied to criminal proceedings, administrative hearings were not subject to such strident rules of law, and the hearing before the HO was not a criminal matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he should be sentenced to life imprisonment because the evidence did not support the jury's statutory aggravator finding. The court disagreed, finding that the evidence of premeditation and substantial planning was overwhelming. In sentencing defendant, the court examined the non-statutory aggravating circumstances alleged by the State. Among other things, the court found evidence that the victim was defenseless and vulnerable given her young age and relative size, defendant had an explosive temper, defendant had deceptive propensities which including misleading his girlfriend, the murder was senseless and without provocation, and defendant attempted to conceal the body. As for mitigating circumstances, the court noted that, inter alia, defendant's father had been verbally abusive to him, defendant's lack of a male role model led to a lack of self confidence and his becoming a follower, defendant had no prior criminal record, defendant was only 23 years old at the time of the murder, and defendant had true remorse for the crimes he committed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss nine counts of a 60-count indictment, charging him with multiple counts each of sexual exploitation of a child (SE), unlawfully dealing in child pornography, and possession of child pornography. The counts sought to be dismissed charged SE, in violation of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1108(1) (2001), with respect to defendant's 13-year-old daughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During execution of a search warrant, the police seized several hundred child pornographic images from defendant's computer, including such images involving his own daughter. Defendant sought dismissal of the charges relating to his daughter engaged in prohibited sexual acts. It was noted that each digital image of his daughter was charged as a separate count of SE, although defendant claimed that they were all a product of one &quot;photo session.&quot; The remaining counts in the indictment related to defendant's voluminous library of child pornography which he allegedly possessed and distributed. Defendant's motion was based on his claim that the counts were multiplicitous and violated the double jeopardy clauses of the Delaware and U.S. Constitutions. The court held that &sect; 1108(1) was not intended to punish a course of conduct, and that each individual image could be used to support a separate count. The court held that when Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 1103(g) and 1108(1) (2001) were read together, it was clear that the crime of SE occurred each time defendant created a &quot;visual depiction&quot; of a child engaged in a &quot;prohibited sexual act.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death. The verdict was affirmed by the state supreme court, and defendant sought certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, which was denied, and the case was returned to Delaware.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed his trial counsel were ineffective and that imposition of the death penalty was unconstitutional as to the facts and events underlying his conviction and sentence. The court did not find any of defendant's attorneys were ineffective. They were not deficient in the representation of defendant when they, with defendant's full understanding and agreement, entered into a hearsay stipulation with the State. Counsel were not ineffective for not seeking a mistrial or &quot;failing to seek any relief&quot; after defendant lots his temper in front of the jury. The jury, by a vote of 11 to 1, found beyond a reasonable doubt the statutory aggravating circumstance that the murder was premeditated and the result of substantial planning. Since Ring did not impact the constitutionality of the 1991 Delaware sentencing statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209, the death penalty imposed in defendant's case was valid. Even so, since a jury found, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of the aggravator of premeditation and substantial planning by a vote of 11-1, the verdict fell within constitutional rulings, and the non-unanimous verdict as to the statutory aggravator was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three counts of murder first degree, two counts of burglary second degree, one count of arson first degree, one count of unlawful sexual intercourse first degree, one count of unlawful sexual penetration first degree, and one count of aggravated harassment, and sentenced to death. After defendant's direct appeal was denied, defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Delaware's statutory scheme for the imposition of the death penalty, following a conviction of first degree murder, violated the Sixth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Ring. Consequently, defendant argued that the doctrine of severability required that a life sentence be imposed. The court found that the United States Supreme Court's decision in Ring did not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review. Therefore, the court did not need to address defendant's contention that Ring invalidated the Delaware sentencing scheme. Further defendant failed to meet his burden of establishing that the instructions of the court on the death penalty improperly described the role assigned to the jury under Delaware law. Finally, the jury's verdict was unanimous in their finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance, therefore, even under the new sentencing structure put in place after Ring, defendant became death qualified.</SPAN></P>

He then moved the trial court to declare that Delaware's death penalty statute,&nbsp;Del.

Defendant cited the Ring and Apprendi cases and claimed that they invalidated so-called &quot;hybrid&quot; death penalty statutes. The trial court disagreed. It found that Delaware satisfied Ring's requirement, that all facts necessary to enhance a sentence from life to death be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, by making a defendant death eligible only if the jury found, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of one of 22 statutorily-enumerated aggravating factors. It then found constitutional the scheme that the jury then make a recommendation whether, in its opinion, a preponderance of the evidence showed that all the aggravating circumstances in the case outweighed all the case's mitigating factors, that the recommendation did not have to be unanimous, and that the recommendation was not binding upon the trial judge, who was charged with making the final sentencing decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of, inter alia, capital murder arising from the killing of a drug dealer and his girlfriend. It was also determined by police that defendant was the shooter in a different murder that occurred approximately five years earlier in Connecticut. However, defendant was never tried for the offense. During the penalty phase of defendant's trial, the State indicated that it intended to call the eyewitness to the unadjudicated Connecticut murder. The State's use of the evidence was to be one of the many non-statutory factors that the jury could consider during the weighing phase of the penalty hearing. Defendant sought to preclude that evidence. The court held that the steps for imposing the death sentence, which were codified at Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209, were carefully crafted to ensure that they were constitutional after Ring. Further, as the Connecticut murder related to the weighing phase of the three-part system employed by the courts under &sect; 4209, rather than the death eligibility phase, Ring was inapplicable. There was no cause for a hearing, as direct eyewitness testimony was deemed plain, clear, and conclusive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had pled no contest to third-degree unlawful sexual contact and endangering the welfare of a child in incidents involving students at a school where he had been a counselor. In the instant proceeding, the State charged him with violating probation by failing to complete a sex offender treatment program in which he had objected to being required to acknowledge his sexually inappropriate behavior.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that in entering a no contest plea, as in entering a guilty plea, defendant had waived any defenses. He did not argue that he had been ill-informed about the consequences of entering his plea, except for the failure to inform him that he would be expected to acknowledge the behavior that led to the plea. The court at plea entry had not been required to inform defendant of collateral consequences of the plea, and the content of the sex offender program fell into that category. Since acceptance of his plea precluded further prosecution for the incidents in question, and since any claim that he would have been led to acknowledge other wrongdoing that could have resulted in prosecution was premature, there was no violation of defendant's guarantee against compulsory self-incrimination, and the requirement of participation in treatment was not a violation of his rights to jury trial or due process, since a probation condition was not the same thing as a sentence. Finally, the court declined to interfere with a determination by an expert agency that participation in a sex offender treatment program was a helpful condition of probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Licenses and Inspection sent notices to the property owners, informing them that they had to register their properties as vacant. Additionally, the Department informed the owners that they had to pay registration fees. The owners filed an administrative appeal for each of the proposed assessments. They contended that the properties were not subject to the vacancy registration fees because the &quot;lawful business&quot; of selling the property was being conducted on the premises. The Board noted that no evidence of selling the properties was provided, and it denied the appeals. On further review, the court initially noted that certiorari review of the matter was proper because review of a quasi-judicial act, for which there was no statutory provision to appeal, was sought. The court found that the ordinance was not an unlawful tax. Further, there was no ex post facto violation as to the civil part of the ordinance, and the criminal penalty section did not assess fines retroactively. The owners received sufficient notice of the proceedings to satisfy due process, and they waived any objection thereto. The court found that the record on appeal was adequate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' earlier capital murder convictions had been upheld by the state's highest court, as had the finding of aggravating factors justifying imposition of the death penalty. On appeal of the initial denial of their motions for post-conviction relief, the highest court had then found that the trial and original post-conviction judge should have recused himself earlier, because of an appearance of possible bias, and remanded with directions that a new judge rule on the post-conviction motions and conduct a new penalty hearing. Disappointed with the new rulings on their post-conviction claims, defendants sought to have him recuse himself from the new penalty proceeding. The judge denied the motion, finding no basis for actual or apparent bias. The statements of fact included in the post-conviction opinion were all part of the record in earlier proceedings, and had been affirmed by the high court already. They were not the judge's private views, and his adverse ruling based on those facts did not show bias either.

The appellate court noted that: (1) the act was not overbroad because the definition of specific sexual activities and the Act itself only applied to establishments meeting the definition of adult entertainment establishment for purposes of determining whether a license was required; (2) the Act's use of the terms &quot;buttocks&quot; and &quot;female breasts below the top of the areola did not render it vague; (3) defendant's gender-neutral argument failed as two different subsections of Del. Code Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 1602 addressed the different genders out of necessity based on the anatomical differences between the genders; and (4) the Act did not operate as a prior restraint since pre-authorization of material to be sold by licensees was not required.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a motion for post-conviction relief. The inmate had been convicted by a jury of bank robbery in the first degree, wearing a disguise during a felony, and tampering with physical evidence. His convictions were upheld on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for not asking for a continuance when the trial court made a misstatement during sentencing. The court held that the issue was barred by the inmate's failure to raise the claim on direct appeal. The court further noted that none of the available means of relief providing for such a procedural ban were applicable as, inter alia, the inmate could not show prejudice resulting from counsel's failure. The inmate also argued that he was improperly sentenced based on an amendment to the robbery statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 832(a)(2) (2003). The inmate was convicted in 2001, and argued that his sentence violated the ex post facto protections because he was serving a sentence for first degree robbery as defined in the 2003 amendment. The court concluded that there was not ex post facto application of the amendment in the instant action, but rather the inmate's sentence was the result of the court's interpretation of the facts and &sect; 832(a)(2) as it existed at that time. Finally, the court concluded that the testimony provided a factual basis for the court's determination that defendant &quot;fiddled with something under his shirt.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved for postconviction relief. Defendant claimed that the Delaware Habitual Offenders statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4214 was cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment and that his previous counsel was incompetent in failing to make this argument during defendant's numerous appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted first degree murder of his wife and of possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony, that being the knife that he used to stab his wife in the back 20 times as she cooked him breakfast, severing her spinal cord and partially paralyzing her. The trial court sentenced defendant as a habitual offender pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4214 to 45 years' imprisonment, suspended after 20 years. A 45-year sentence, suspended after 20 years, for horrifically stabbing and maiming one's wife, while attempting to kill her, did not create an inference of gross disproportionality. Such a crime was not the least serious type of felony or caused no harm to anyone or was not the kind of repeated violent crime common to many habitual offenders as had been found in cases where the sentence was found to be disproportionate. Since defendant's proffered Eighth Amendment claim was frivolous, his prior counsel was in no way ineffective for failing to raise it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the announcement of the jury's verdict in another criminal proceeding and while all parties were still in the courtroom, defendant allegedly made a threatening statement to the victim, his attorney, to the effect that: &quot;I won't be in jail forever.&quot; He then allegedly handed the victim an envelope which contained a piece of paper listing names, addresses and phone numbers for the victim, his brother, his sister-in-law, and his ex-wife. Defendant was then indicted under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1240 for threatening a public official. Defendant contended that code section was constitutionally infirm because it was vague and overbroad. The court found that because the speech proscribed by the statute, threats to public officials, did not qualify for protection under the First Amendment, the statute was not overbroad. Further, because the statute adequately explained the proscribed conduct, provided fair notice to a person of ordinary intelligence of what behavior was forbidden by statute, and was not drafted in such a manner as to allow arbitrary or erratic enforcement, it was neither vague as applied to defendant nor vague on its face.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant/bar offered entertainment consisting of female dancers dressed in costumes partially covering their genitalia, breasts, and buttocks. The State brought charges against defendants for operating an adult entertainment establishment without a proper license and conspiracy to do so. Defendants moved to dismiss the charges, contending that: the Act was vague and overbroad; the application of the Act's license requirement to the restaurant/bar, while exempting video stores that sold sexually explicit material, violated the Equal Protection Clause; and that the purpose of the Act did not have any factual relation to the operation of the restaurant/bar. The court concluded that the terms &quot;buttocks&quot; and &quot;female breasts below the top of the areola&quot; were not unconstitutionally vague. The disparate treatment claimed by defendants was at best illusory. Any establishment promoting and/or presenting the kind of &quot;entertainment&quot; that was observed at the restaurant/bar would be regulated under the Act as an adult entertainment establishment. Finally, the court found that the prosecution of the case was not inconsistent with the legislative intent behind the enactment of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants charged with operating an adult entertainment business without a license in violation of the Delaware Adult Entertainment Establishments Act, Del. Code Ann. tit. 24, ch. 16, moved to dismiss the charges, arguing that the statute violated their First Amendment freedoms, arguing particularly that space and distance restrictions effectively denied them adequate alternative avenues of communication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In addition to requiring licenses for adult entertainment establishments, the Act adopted certain distance requirements (from each other, residences, churches, and schools) that had already been found valid when they were embodied in a county zoning ordinance. Because defendants' establishment was near a church (despite intervening roads and natural obstacles), they could not obtain a license. When they continued to operate, charges were filed against them. The court noted that while live adult entertainment was constitutionally protected, it was subject to content neutral, appropriately tailored time, place, and manner restrictions. The legislature had enacted the statute in light of a valid legislative purpose to prevent criminal activity that often accompanied such establishments, and it could reasonably adopt the findings that had been found to validate such legislation elsewhere. Looking to whether adequate alternative sites were available, the court held that since defendants admitted that 12 potential sites were available for their one business, the alternatives were constitutionally adequate as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, drunk and angry, poured liquor on a kitchen burner. The resulting blaze killed and injured tenants in other apartments, and defendant was convicted of felony murder and first-degree assault. After Delaware's highest court interpreted language in the felony murder statute (and by implication, the first-degree assault statute) as requiring a showing that the killing occurred in furtherance of the underlying felony, which could not be shown in defendant's case, he challenged his conviction. The court held that even though the motion would normally have been untimely, defendant was entitled to relief on fundamental fairness grounds. He was not entitled to a new trial because the evidence was ample to support convictions of lesser offenses. Although the evidence could have supported depraved indifference murder, the State had not pursued that theory at trial, so the court modified the judgment to convict defendant of involuntary manslaughter and second-degree manslaughter. Resentencing on those charges would not violate due process as long as defendant did not receive longer sentences than those originally imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion for relief, vacated the convictions, modified the judgment to reduce them to convictions for involuntary manslaughter and second-degree assault, and announced its intention to resentence defendant accordingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured prevailed against defendant insurer in a trial on the insured's claim that the insurer was responsible for paying reconstruction expenses to the insured based on a fire that occurred in the insured's building. The insured then sought an award of attorney's fees pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4102. The insurer claimed in its response that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer and the insured disputed the responsibility for the cost of reconstruction expenses resulting from a fire in a building the insured leased. The dispute arose under a business owners' property coverage policy that the inured had with the insurer. After a one-day non-jury trial, the trial court awarded the insured a small sum because it found the insurer had already paid the insured up to the policy limits. The insured then submitted an attorney's fee request that was more than 10 times the judgment. The request was pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4102, which allowed a trial court rendering a judgment against an insurer on a property insurance policy to award attorney's fees. The insured argued in response that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court found that the statute was constitutional because it was a reasonable provision given that insurance operations affected a wide segment of the population. It also found that the insured was a &quot;prevailing party&quot; entitled to such fees. However, it found the amount requested was unreasonable in relation to the recovery, warranting a lesser award, and that punitive damages should not be awarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court awarded a contingency fee of one-third of the judgment obtained to the insured.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. They filed motions for postconviction relief, which were denied. On appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court remanded the case for a new penalty hearing and directed that a newly assigned judge readdress defendants' claims for postconviction relief. The first defendant filed a motion to preclude a new penalty hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendants' argument that appellate counsel was ineffective for not claiming error in the trial court's decision not to give a Chance instruction in accordance with Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 271 and 274. The evidence conclusively showed a planned and intentional killing in which defendants participated. Chance, therefore, was inapplicable here. Next, the second defendant's counsel was not deficient for not having certain witnesses testify. Although the investigation was deficient, the evidence against defendant was overwhelming. The decision to focus on saving defendant's life through the mitigating evidence in the penalty phase and to avoid a credibility clash between the guilt and penalty phases was not unreasonable. Furthermore, defendant had not shown the probability that the outcome of the guilt phase would have been different if the witnesses had testified. Finally, insofar as defendants' new penalty hearings were to be conducted under the 2002 amendment to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209, their challenges to the 1991 statute based on Ring were moot. Furthermore, the jury's unanimous verdicts on the statutory aggravating circumstances satisfied Ring.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motions for postconviction relief and the first defendant's motion to preclude a new penalty hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murdering two people, attempted murder of a third person, and other crimes. He filed a motion to prohibit application of H.B. 287, 142nd Gen. Assem. (Del. 2003), which amended Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209(d)(1), and to alternatively dispense with the death qualification of the jury. He argued that the new law's retroactive application to his case violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. He also moved for a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's first-degree murder charges were brought pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 636(a)(1) and (2). Defendant's motion for change of venue was made pursuant to Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 21(a). In rejecting defendant's ex post facto argument, the court found that the change in the law, which became effective after the alleged crimes were committed, was only a procedural change. The change at issue re-affirmed the intent of the Delaware General Assembly that the sentencing judge in a capital murder case was ultimately responsible for determining the penalty. The change was procedural because it did not increase the punishment or change the ingredients of the offense or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt. A procedural change in the law did not implicate the ex post facto clause. Defendant alternatively argued that it was not necessary for the jury to be &quot;death qualified,&quot; as the jury's recommendation served little purpose, since it could be summarily rejected. The court found that jurors comprised the &quot;conscience of the community.&quot; Therefore, even though they were not the final arbiters of punishment, they still played a vital and important role in sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to prohibit application of the newly-enacted bill and to dispense with death qualification of the jury was denied. Defendant's motion for a change of venue was denied without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The insurer argued that federal law, and more specifically the Product Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981, as amended by the Liability Risk Retention Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3901-3906 (1994), preempted &sect; 2107(a), such that the insurer was able to file its responsive pleading without first having to procure a certificate of authority or post bond and/or security. The trial court concluded that the insurer could not defend against the complaint in any lawful manner. However, pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 2107(b) the court, in its discretion, ordered a postponement to afford the insurer a reasonable opportunity to comply with the provisions of &sect; 2107(a), and to defend the action.</SPAN></P>

Further motions and appeals resulted in affirmance of the trial court's determination. The court evaluated defendant's postconviction motion for relief and found that it was filed approximately 17 1/2 years after his conviction became final, which rendered it untimely under Del. Super.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the police lacked reasonable, articulable suspicion to detain and search him. The State argued that race identity alone could be used to initiate an investigation as long as there was no contemporaneous seizure, and that the officers had reasonable grounds upon which to base defendant's seizure. The court concluded that the stop and detention of defendant violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 because the only basis the officers had to suspect criminal activity was defendant's race. All the officers knew was that defendant was a black man in what one officer believed was a white neighborhood who had walked down one family's driveway and sat in another individual's vehicle. Neither of these actions, standing alone or taken together, suggested criminal activity. Nor did they meet the reasonable and articulable suspicion standard set forth in Terry or Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1902. Thus, all the evidence flowing from the detention had to be suppressed.

A victim who was mentally retarded and had Parkinson's disease needed assistance with daily living activities. When the provider left the bathroom to answer the telephone while she had been preparing the victim's bath, the victim went into the tub. She suffered burns from the hot running bath water. The provider claimed that she had tried to call the State's &quot;on-call&quot; number but could not get through. The provider was notified that the State had placed her name on the Registry based on a finding of proposed concern of adult abuse. Pursuant to &sect; 8564(b), an administrative hearing was held. A hearing officer concluded that the provider had committed neglect, as she left the victim alone in the bathroom, failed to seek timely medical attention, and failed to follow the prescribed treatment plan. On review, the court found no merit to the provider's void-for-vagueness challenge to the statutory definition of &quot;neglect&quot; in &sect; 1131(9). Substantial evidence supported the Division's findings, and the penalty imposed was not an abuse of discretion by the hearing officer, as mitigating circumstances were considered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's original arrest in an unrelated matter, he took to hanging around the Delaware State Capitol and office building, and was found more than once in private areas of the governor's office even after he had been told that the office could not help him and that he was not allowed in private areas. When he was finally arrested, he was uncooperative. The appellate court reviewed the decision of a trial court of limited jurisdiction for errors of law, while showing great deference to findings of fact supported by credible evidence, of which there was a great deal. The record did not support a single one of defendant's claims, even the constitutional ones. He had failed to show he had been prejudiced by a purported denial of access to legal materials, he had never objected to wearing prison clothes (due to incarceration for the unrelated offense), no one had threatened his right to self-representation, and there was no denial of due process in allowing the investigating officer to stay in the courtroom. Most of defendant's claims simply challenged the trial court's exercise of discretion in making certain rulings, but the appellate court found no abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed (1) newly discovered evidence pursuant to Rule 61(i)(5), (2) ineffective assistance of counsel, (3) failure to call key witnesses, (4) failure to prepare, (5) abuse of discretion, and (6) defective indictment. Defendant's Rule 61 motion claims were procedurally barred either (1) under Rule 61(i)(1) since his motion was filed more than three years after his conviction, (2) under Rule P. 61(i)(4) for claims that were not formerly adjudicated in any proceeding leading to the judgment of conviction, or (3) also for claims that were solely conclusory allegations effectively addressed pretrial or during trial. In addition to contradicting the record, defendant's assertions did not satisfy a three-prong test for introduction of new evidence to warrant a new trial. Defendant's ineffective counsel claim amounted to mere conclusory finger-pointing rather than specific instances of failure to measure up to professional standards and he failed to demonstrate the existence of a constitutional violation resulting in a miscarriage of justice or undermining the fundamental fairness of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was on trial for attempted robbery, assault first degree, and related weapons offenses, arising from an aborted liquor store robbery during which the storeowner was shot and critically injured. Shortly after the robbery, a newspaper reporter arrived on the scene and interviewed defendant. The State subpoenaed the reporter to testify. She moved to quash the subpoena, claiming she enjoyed a qualified privilege to refuse to testify.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statement made by defendant to the reporter contradicted what defendant told the police concerning his whereabouts at the time of the crime. In what appeared to be a case of first impression, the court addressed the issue of whether Delaware's Reporter's Privilege Act, Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 4320 et seq. (1999), applied when a reporter sought to protect the content of information provided by a known and identified source. The reporter argued that the Act only applied when a reporter sought to protect the identity of a confidential source. The court found that the Act itself revealed no legislative intent to limit its application to claims of privilege relating to source information only. To the contrary, the Act cast a net wide enough to capture all claims of privilege by a reporter. The court found that the Act was constitutional. In balancing various factors, the court found that the public interest in having the reporter's testimony outweighed the public interest in keeping the information confidential. The public had a right to a full and fair trial. Therefore, the reporter could not avail herself of the qualified reporter's privilege in the instant case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to quash was denied, and the reporter was ordered to appear at trial to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was arrested for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and aggravated menacing, he posted bail and was released.

Therefore, the State attempted to forfeit the surety pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 2116(b)(1) (2002). The court held that the surety's impairment of the contracts clause argument failed because &sect; 2116 was enacted prior to the time in which the contract for bail was entered. However, the due process rights afforded by &sect; 2116 were illusory. The statute created an irrebuttable presumption of guilt based solely upon an arrest, indictment, or finding of probable cause at a preliminary hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of various drug and driving offenses. He was declared a habitual offender, and received a life sentence on a trafficking conviction. He appealed, one possession charge was dismissed, and the remaining aspects of the sentence were affirmed. Defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief, pursuant to Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61. The matter was referred to a court commissioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner found that the postconviction claim was timely and that it was an initial motion for postconviction relief. Defendant's claims were premised on allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. Such claims were not normally subject to the procedural default rule. However, in making such claims, a movant had to make and substantiate concrete allegations of actual prejudice or risk summary dismissal. In the instant case, defendant attempted to show cause by merely making conclusory assertions of ineffectiveness of counsel. The failure was fatal to the petition for postconviction relief. Defendant claimed that the State did not prove intent to sell, as suggested by the term &quot;trafficking.&quot; The commissioner found that there was nothing unconstitutional or ambiguous about Del. Code Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 4753A. Knowingly possessing a certain quantity of cocaine or greater resulted in a person being guilty of the offense. Defendant's assertion to impose an additional requirement regarding distribution was not required by law, and was rejected. Defendant's claim that his attorney should have argued his actual or constructive possession of cocaine was meritless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When applying Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1709, to defendant's conduct at issue in the instant case, the court found that the statute was clear enough so that defendant should have realized that his shooting of a dog on his property was not privileged, unless he was shooting in self-defense. Given that many of the facts in the instant case were disputed, it would have to be determined at trial whether the privilege statute even applied to defendant's conduct. Defendant also argued that Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1325(b)(4) was unconstitutionally vague because it did not set forth a state of mind, regarding the element of the animal's belonging to another. The court found that the statute was not unconstitutional for failing to specifically define a mental state for that element. In finding this to be an issue of first impression in Delaware, the court concluded that the mental state, with respect to the &quot;belonging&quot; element, was either reckless or intentional. In addition, the statute was not facially overbroad or vague. Absent an allegation of selective prosecution, based upon an unjustifiable standard, equal protection guarantees did not come into play.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The questions were questions that the Delaware Supreme Court earlier declined to accept in a prior case. Defendant argued that, under the United States Supreme Court precedent, it was appropriate for the court to require an indictment of those aggravating factors, which were utilized by the State in seeking the enhanced penalty of death. The State argued that the statutory aggravators that supported the imposition of the death penalty were defendant's past convictions of assault. The court held that, although the prior case may have been factually distinguishable from the current prosecution of defendant, the supreme court already determined that it would not accept the two questions sought by defendant to be certified in the subject case. The supreme court deferred ruling on whether or not to accept any additional questions certified to it. In its discretion, the court declined to certify any additional questions, given that the supreme court had already ruled what questions of law concerning the death penalty statute were to be considered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his co-defendant were charged with murder in the first degree, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, robbery in the first degree, and conspiracy in the second degree. Defendant was charged with several more counts of various crimes, as well as an additional charge of wearing a disguise during the commission of a felony. Defendant sought to join in a pending certification matter as to the constitutionality of certain aspects of the Delaware death penalty statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209, and prior to that request having been ruled upon, he filed the instant request for certification of three other questions on the same issue, on which the Delaware Supreme Court had previously deferred a ruling. The questions concerned the constitutionality of having to state aggravators in an indictment and in requiring a unanimous jury as to the decision of whether a defendant was a major participant in a felony that led to a killing. The court denied the request to certify, holding that the Delaware Supreme Court already indicated on which issues it would make a determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to both reckless driving, in violation of Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4175, and disregarding a police officer's signal, in violation of Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4103. Defendant was sentenced, as a subsequent offender, under Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4103(b), by the Court of Common Pleas of the State of Delaware, New Castle County. Defendant appealed the sentence imposed, as a subsequent offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's subsequent offender status was based upon a conviction for the same offense, eight years earlier. Defendant argued that Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4103 did not define a subsequent like offense and did not set forth a time period for the first offense to run. He requested that the matter be remanded, as the statute was void for vagueness. If not remanded, defendant argued that the court should impute a five-year statutory time frame. In rejecting these arguments, the appellate court found that defendant's citation of various other provisions of the motor vehicle code, containing time limitations, merely emphasized the fact that the legislature could have included a time limitation in the statute at issue herein, but did not do so. The absence of a defined time limitation did not serve to invalidate Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4103(b). There was no merit to the claim of unconstitutional vagueness. After his initial conviction, defendant was placed on notice that another offense under the same statute, occurring later in time, would constitute a subsequent like offense. The sentence imposed fell within the statutory limits, and there was no error of law.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced as a habitual offender to a mandatory 48-year term of incarceration. Defendant appealed his conviction, which was affirmed by the state supreme court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised three grounds for relief: that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, that his sentence represented cruel and unusual punishment, and that the court's determination that he was a habitual offender violated his right to due process of law. The court found that defendant's grounds for relief were without merit. Counsel's representation of defendant prior to and during trial met reasonable professional standards. Counsel stated that he met with defendant on several occasions and reviewed with him his trial strategy and other matters. In addition, counsel reviewed all discovery offered by the State and requested additional information that he thought would be helpful to the defense. Counsel did not mislead defendant regarding the terms of the plea offer by the State. Counsel did not err by failing to raise the constitutionality of the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4214, when Delaware case law upheld the statute's constitutionality. Finally, there was no error in determining the existence of prior convictions in order to designate defendant a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant entered a lease agreement to open a restaurant in a commercial development. Because another applicant had already been granted a permit of compliance in the development, a licensing supervisor denied the restaurant's application. The court examined the city's zoning code and determined that the board of adjustment could reasonably conclude that the development consisted of one building. Although the structure's middle section was not roofed, the Rehoboth Beach, Del., Mun. Code ch. 19, &sect;&sect; 19-4, -39 did not require a roof, nor did the absence of a roof imply the existence of two buildings. The board could consider the architect's and the owner's intent, as well as potential building code violations as evidence that only one building existed in the development. The board's actions upon which the restaurant rested its constitutional claim were proper.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court dismissed the appeal as to the convictions for driving an unsafe motor vehicle, operating a motorcycle without a helmet/glasses, and operating an unregistered vehicle, leaving for consideration defendant's appeal regarding his conviction for failure to have insurance identification in possession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that, when defendant was pulled over while operating a motorcycle, he failed to display an insurance card at the request of a police officer as required by Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 2118(p) (1995) and that the documents defendant provided at trial did not constitute an insurance policy under &sect; 2118(p) or the necessary insurance card as defined by Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 2118(o) (1995). On appeal, defendant argued that (1) as a dealer, Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 316 (1995) exempted him from the requirements of &sect; 2118(p); (2) he presented sufficient proof of insurance at trial; and (3) &sect; 2118(p) did not require him to provide proof of insurance unless he was in an accident. The superior court held that &sect; 316 exempted dealers from certain registration requirements; it did not exempt them from displaying an insurance identification card for vehicles they operated. Substantial evidence supported the trial court's finding that the proof of insurance presented at trial related only to vehicles at defendant's dealership and did not satisfy &sect; 2118(p). The officer had authority to request the insurance card regardless of whether there was an accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The investor and others formed a limited liability company. When the company's earnings fell to a dangerous low, the manager and the members withheld capital contributions. As a result, the company defaulted on its financing obligations, and was put up for sale at private auction. The investor received nothing from the proceeds of the sale. He subsequently filed suit alleging that the members and the manager conspired to defraud him of his equity interest. The court held that the members did not participate materially in managing the company. They never served on the managing committee. The manager, however, was a manager of the company when many of the disputed events occurred. He actively participated in many of the negotiations involved in the sale of the company. He could reasonably have anticipated being subject to Delaware jurisdiction under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's request for and afforded defendant leave to expand the record and for a full evidentiary hearing. Defendant was found to have shot a defenseless gas station attendant between the eyes during an attempted robbery in the middle of the night. Defendant's behavior after the murder was also cold-blooded; defendant, while in prison, had posed with a murder weapon threatening his accuser, voiced hope for escape, and showed no interest in rehabilitative activities. The court found defendant's experienced trial counsel was not ineffective because (1) he could act solo; (2) he did investigate prior to the trial and the penalty hearing; (3) he was not required to maximize, but to use, and did use in an objectively reasonable way, defendant's mother as a witness; (4) of his failure to pursue defendant's voluntary drug use's effect on his motor control; (5) of his use of open ended questions during voir dire; and (6) of failure to use lingering doubt as a mitigating factor. Apprendi did not apply; the jury made a sentencing recommendation and defendant's penalty was not enhanced to exceed the maximum permitted. The appellate counsel was not ineffective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the decision of the Court of Common Pleas (Delaware), under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 9902(c), (d), which granted defendant's post-trial motion to suppress evidence and vacated defendant's conviction for driving under the influence (DUI).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for DUI. While his post-trial motions were pending, defendant filed an appeal. Instead of suspending litigation, defendant and the State continued litigating defendant's post-trial motions, and the trial court decided the post-trial motions in defendant's favor. On appeal, the State challenged the trial court's subject-matter jurisdiction and the timeliness of defendant's de facto suppression motion, coming after the verdict. The appellate court observed the general rule in Delaware was that, proper perfection of an appeal divested the trial court of its jurisdiction over the cause of action. In addition, an appeal was perfected when noticed. The trial court lost jurisdiction after defendant noticed his appeal to the appellate court. Accordingly, the trial court's post trial decision was out of order, literally, and the case had to be remanded for reconsideration by the trial court. The appellate court advised that the remand was not merely a formality, but that the trial court might wish to reconsider its legal conclusions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court remanded the case and directed that if the trial court continued to hold that the suppression question was not time barred, then the trial court should give the State a formal opportunity to make a record and argue the issue fully.</SPAN></P>

The test results showed a blood alcohol content (BAC) of .221 percent and hospital personnel reported these results to police. The trial court held that (1) because the hospital personnel worked for a private hospital and they drew the defendant's blood without being asked to do so by police, the defendant could claim no Fourth Amendment right to privacy in that process; (2) pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 2750(b), the defendant had no doctor-patient privilege in the hospital's BAC test results and those results could be admitted at the defendant's trial pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 2750(a); and (3) because the results of the hospital's BAC test were admissible, the results of an independent test which police conducted on a blood sample they obtained from the defendant after learning of the hospital's test results were also admissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendant abutting landowners after she was injured in a fall on the sidewalk. Wilmington, Del., Charter &amp; Code tit. 1, &sect; 42-42, imposed responsibility on abutting landowners for maintaining their sidewalks.

The court held that under the home rule statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 802, the city could legislate to carry out its responsibilities as needed. The ordinance in question did not evade responsibility for sidewalk maintenance; it simply delegated it to defendants. Such a delegation was a proper exercise of home rule powers.</SPAN></P>

Licensed plumbers were a different classification and had a property right in their existing licenses. Applicants and licensed plumbers were not similarly situated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant on three counts of first degree murder for killing an attempted robbery victim under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 636(a)(1), (2), (6). The jury recommended a life sentence. The Superior Court of Delaware, New Castle, considered defendant's sentence and rendered its decision in the opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court merged the &sect; 636(a)(6) charge into the &sect; 636(a)(2) charge because Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 206 prohibited conviction on two offenses where the offenses were established by proof of the same facts. The jury recommendation was not binding on the court.  Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209(d)(1) required only that the court consider the jury's recommendation. The court could completely reject the jury recommendation. The court explained why the jury recommendation was not necessarily the conscience of the community. The court sentenced defendant on the &sect; 636(a)(1), (2) charges to death under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209(d)(1)b. The court summarized how the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors. The court found substantial circumstances that justified the death penalty. Defendant had (1) killed and probably attempted another killing during the attempted robbery, (2) a criminal record with premeditated lawlessness with an undercurrent of violence, (3) participated in another armed robbery under similar conditions the night before, (4) no remorse, and (5) an inability to conform to open society or prison rules. The victim was a good person.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sentenced the defendant to the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developer filed suit against defendants, foundation, the Delaware Department of Agriculture, and farm owner, in response to defendant foundation's approval of defendant farm's application to create an agricultural preservation district (APD) pursuant to the Delaware Agricultural Lands Preservation Act (ALPA), Del. Code. Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 910(a)(2). The parties cross-moved for summary judgment on the issue of whether a taking occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought to develop a parcel of land as a residential subdivision concurrent with defendant farm's designation as an ADP. Under ALPA, Del. Code. Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 910(a)(2), any &quot;new subdivision development&quot; (NSD) had to observe a 50-foot setback requirement from a designated APD. The court held that the 50-foot setback requirement applied to plaintiff. Although ALPA was not a zoning regulation, plaintiff was a NSD under the &quot;permit-plus&quot; rule because it had not taken any steps beyond recording a development plan. The 50-foot setback was not a taking under the Penn Central factors. The character of the government action was not to deny all use of the property to plaintiff, but to protect neighboring properties from agricultural nuisance while preserving farmland. Although the setback rendered certain lots unusable for a residence and affected the development of other lots, plaintiff property rights were not significantly impacted. The setback did not extensively interfere with plaintiff's investment backed expectations because most of the property could still be developed as planned, and the property within the setback could be put to other use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment granted to defendants. A taking did not occur because the character of the government action was not to deny all use of the property, plaintiff's property rights were not significantly impacted, most of the property could be developed as planned, and the property within the setback was only restricted from residential use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After converting defendants' motion to dismiss to one for summary judgment, the court found that defendant entities were entitled to sovereign immunity on many of plaintiff's claims. Individual defendants were not entitled to immunity based on the Tort Claims Act, Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 4001-4013. The actions plaintiff complained of concerned the manner in which the individual defendants carried out their duty to investigate, and she pled sufficient facts to implicitly constitute allegations of bad faith, defeating the &quot;good faith&quot; element of tort immunity. Individual defendants were entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim, to the extent that it contained a claim of a deprivation of constitutionally protected rights without substantive due process. However, they were not entitled to summary judgment as to plaintiff's claims of deprivation of constitutionally protected interests without procedural due process as were set forth in her &sect; 1983 claim. Defendants' motion was also denied as to their challenge to the balance of plaintiff complaint, given the need for further investigation to resolve applicable legal questions.</SPAN></P>

Del. Harness Racing Comm'n R. V.I.AA.1, R. V.I.P.1(j) were not overly vague. Appellants' violation of these rules was supported by substantial evidence. Appellee's decision to refer the matter to the presiding judge for investigation and to initiate a proceeding to hear the complaint which he in turn submitted was not an abuse of its authority because appellants were attempting to discredit an official who was investigating one of the appellants.

Appellant's plan did not comply with the new code requirements, but appellant argued its plan was grandfathered. The planning board found appellant's failure to submit a preliminary major plan in the time allotted meant it lost the grandfathering protection. The trial court found appellant's failure to meet the former requirements removed the grandfather protection provided for compliance with the former code, as the plan had expired and there was nothing to grandfather. Appellant had to comply with the new provisions both in regulation of land use and review procedure. The writ of certiorari had to be denied as the planning board did not err, as a matter of law, in its conclusion. The writ of mandamus had to be dismissed, since as the new code divested the county council of jurisdiction over the planning board decisions, appellant had no legal right for the trial court to enforce against the county council.</SPAN></P>

Defendant refused to release the car and asserted a garagemen's lien for the amount it contended was owed.

Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing she was exempt from licensing requirements in Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1441, because defendant was a peace officer under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1441(g). The court held the language of Del.

There were no conditions or limitations on the terms police or peace officers. However, the court held that while Del.

The interests of the children would best be served by granting the parties joint legal custody and shared residency of the children where the father was the de facto father of one child and the presumptive father of two other children. The parties resided in relatively close proximity to each other, which would favor an alternate week schedule.</SPAN></P>

The guardian stipulated that the child was no longer dependent or neglected. Based on the majority of factors it was in the child's best interests to grant the mother primary residency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a biological mother and an adoptive father, filed a motion asking the court to set the standard to use in considering their request to modify visitation enjoyed by a minor child and respondents, a biological father's mother (paternal grandmother) and her husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior decision, respondents were granted frequent and liberal visitation with the child. In making that order, the court accepted the biological father's statement that he believed his mother and step-father should be able to see the child. In making its visitation decision, the court placed upon respondents the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that visitation with them was in the best interest of the child. The biological father's rights were terminated a couple of years later and adoption of the child was granted. In ruling on petitioners' motion, the court noted that the facts were distinguishable from the statutory restriction prohibiting a terminated parent or their relatives from filing for third-party visitation, as respondents were not filing for visitation but were already exercising visitation. The court concluded that petitioner's request for modification of respondents' visitation rights was reviewable under the best interest of the child standard. Contrary to petitioners' argument, respondents were not required to prove the child would be dependent, neglected, or abused in the petitioners' care to continue visitation over their objection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that petitioners' motion to modify should be reviewed by considering the best interest of the child.</SPAN></P>
