Admin. R. 59. After the litigant failed to file an amended response within the time allowed, the judge entered a final order declaring the litigant to be vexatious. The litigant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge issued the pre-filing order following requests from several district court and magistrate judges. The final order precluded the litigant from filing any new pro se litigation in the courts of Idaho without first obtaining leave of a judge. The reviewing court held that the litigant waived challenges to the adequacy of service of the pre-filing order because she admitted to receiving service and submitted to the court's jurisdiction, that the final order was not premature because the litigant was given sufficient time to respond, that the judge did not have a duty to disqualify himself under Idaho R. Civ. P. 40(d)(1) or 40(d)(2) because those rules did not apply in the proceedings, that Idaho Ct. Admin. R. 59 was not unconstitutionally vague, and that the litigant was afforded adequate due process of law. The final order did not constitute an abuse of the judge's discretion because the record showed that the litigant had filed three pro se litigations within the past seven years that were finally determined adversely to her, which could not be relitigated, and because she had been declared vexatious by other state and federal courts.</SPAN></P>

Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 72-803 did not conflict with Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 3-205. The Commission did not repeal &sect; 3-205 by adopting the rule. The rule did not infringe upon judicial power where it required an attorney to show that the attorney's services operated primarily or substantially to secure the fund from which a contingent fee was sought. There was no free speech violation because it did not prevent the law firm from being paid for legal advice. Finally, there was no deprivation of liberty without due process of law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders of the Commission were affirmed, and it was awarded costs on appeal. A prior opinion rendered in this case was withdrawn, and this opinion was substituted in its place.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Third Judicial District, Canyon County, Idaho, granted respondent Idaho State Insurance Fund's (SIF) motion for summary judgment on appellant policyholder's suit seeking a declaratory judgment that SIF violated Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 72-915 by failing to distribute premium rate adjustments on a pro rata basis. The district court fund that the retroactive repeal of &sect; 72-915 was constitutional. The policyholder appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The policyholder asked the supreme court to reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with the determination that the retroactive appeal of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 72-915 was unconstitutional. The supreme court noted that it would use federal rules and methodology unless clear precedent or circumstances unique to Idaho or its constitution provided greater protection. The supreme court has recognized a limited exception, based upon the state's police power, to the protection provided by Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The challenges based upon article I, &sect; 16 should be evaluated under the federal framework and rules. The retroactive appeal of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 72-915 substantially impaired the policyholder's contract rights because the dividend was part of the consideration. Repealing the statute that provided for the possibility of a premium refund reduced the maximum value of the contract to the policyholder. The legislative act adversely affected an essential element of the contracts between the parties. The retroactive repeal was not reasonable and necessary to support a significant and legitimate public purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant law firm challenged orders from respondent Industrial Commission (Idaho), which denied fee requests pursuant to Idaho Admin. Code r. 17.02.08.033.01.c.ii. (1994) because the firm did not prove that its attorneys were primarily or substantially responsible for securing certain worker's compensation benefits for its clients or that such benefits were disputed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In each case, the fee agreement provided for a 25 percent contingent fee, and the case was settled without a hearing. It was undisputed that the firm's attorneys were not primarily or substantially responsible for securing the awards from which the firm sought a percentage. The court held that the rule did not exceed the Commission's authority under Idaho Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 72-803, 72-508 to adopt administrative rules regulating the amount of a reasonable attorney fee in worker's compensation proceedings. Because the measure of compensation for attorneys in worker's compensation cases was restrained by law, the rule did not improperly limit the firm's freedom to contract and did not conflict with Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 3-205. There was no separation of powers violation because the rule did not infringe upon legislative power or upon the judiciary's power to regulate the practice of law. The First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, was not violated because the firm was not prevented from giving advice to a client. The firm was given notice and an opportunity for a hearing, thus, it received due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to a nuisance claim, an injunction was issued. There were two components listed for lifting the injunction. After range improvements were made, the IDFG sought to lift both components of the injunction. The trial court denied relief and found that the Act was unconstitutional. This appeal followed. In reversing, the supreme court decided to review the trial court's interpretation of its injunctive order with an abuse of discretion standard. The trial court erred by refusing to lift the 500-shooter component of the injunction because the trial court's interpretation did not follow the plain language of the injunction. The IDFG had clearly complied with the stated requirements of the injunction. Moreover, the Act was a constitutional general law, not a special law. It applied to all shooting ranges in like situations, even when considered in conjunction with HB 604. Moreover, the Act had none of the hallmarks of special laws. The Act was also not an unconstitutional deprivation of judicial power under Idaho Const. art. V, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 25-3705A(3) provided authorization for the State to legally &quot;take&quot; the escaped domestic elk without liability.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant irrigation district filed a petition for a ground water to ground water delivery call. Applying Idaho Admin. Code r. 37.03.11, appellee, the Director of the Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR), found that the district was not materially injured. The District Court of the Fifth Judicial District, Minidoka County (Idaho), affirmed. The district appealed. Cross-appeals were filed by a city and others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The irrigation district's delivery call was based on its senior water right. The petition sought both administration of junior priority ground water rights from its water source and a designation of the source as a ground water management area. Among other things, it alleged that junior priority groundwater pumping from the source had lowered the water table, which resulted in a reduction of the irrigation district's diversion rate. The IDWR Director properly found that the irrigation district's water right was subject to the provisions of the 1951 Idaho Ground Water Act, Idaho Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 42-226 to -239, and that the irrigation district had not been required to pump water beyond a reasonable ground water pumping level. The Director had substantial and competent evidence to support his decision not to set a reasonable groundwater pumping level and to analyze the water right on a system-wide as opposed to a well-by-well basis. Finally, the district court did not err in imposing the clear and convincing evidentiary standard on the Director's determination of material injury in a delivery call.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Ada County, which convicted him of failure to register as a sex offender in violation of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-8309 (2001) and denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 18-8309 did not require sex offenders to register or update their address information with the Idaho State Police Sex Offender Registry or the sheriff of the county where the offenders were required to register after moving to another country. The supreme court held that the evidence did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant failed to register as a sex offender in violation of &sect; 18-8309. Section 18-8309 did not apply when an offender changed his or her address or actual residence to another country. There was no evidence that defendant changed his address to another state. There was no evidence at trial as to how defendant left Idaho. Assuming that defendant traveled through one or more states before leaving the United States, he would not necessarily have had an address in any of those states. Because &sect; 18-8309(2) applied when an offender changed his or her address to another state, &sect; 18-8309(1) applied when an offender changed his or her address or actual residence to another place in Idaho. The supreme court also concluded that there was insufficient evidence that defendant changed his address or actual residence to a place in Idaho.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court vacated the district court's judgment of conviction and remanded the case with instructions for the entry of a judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the State of Idaho Transportation Board, brought a condemnation action against defendant company to acquire land for a highway improvement project.

The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Ada County, summarily dismissed defendant's counterclaim. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To complete a highway project, the State acquired two construction easements on defendant's property where it was operating a hotel. In the State's condemnation action, defendant counterclaimed for inverse condemnation and submitted a business damages claim under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 7-711(2)(b). Defendant claimed: (1) the State effectively condemned its primary access to its property; (2) the hotel's ability to be seen by passing motorists; and (3) produced backed-up traffic. The district court correctly dismissed defendant's circuity claim because its right of access did not include a right to continued traffic flow under Idaho law. Defendant's damages for the taking under Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 14 could not include the limitation of access to a driveway caused by changes in traffic flow. Motorists still had free access to and from defendant's property. Defendant had no compensable property right in continued visibility under Idaho law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney general challenged a decision from the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Valley County, which dismissed a complaint alleging that Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 58-310A was unconstitutional. Cross-appellant lessees challenged a decision to grant summary judgment in favor of cross-respondents, the State Board of Land Commissioners and the Idaho Department of Lands Director, in a lease dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was concerning residential leases on endowment lands. The lessees contended that increased rent breached the terms of the existing leases. The attorney general contended that Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 58-310A, which exempted cottage site leases from a conflict auction, violated Idaho Const. art. IX, &sect; 8. The trial court dismissed the constitutional challenge and granted summary judgment against the lessees based on a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. This appeal followed. On review, the supreme court determined that the attorney general was not subject to the usual standing analysis due to his unique position as counsel for the State of Idaho; even if he was, the requirements for standing were met. Next, Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 58-310A was unconstitutional because any disposal of endowment land had to be at public auction. The word &quot;disposal&quot; meant any lease or sale. The entirety of &sect; 58-310A failed because it was not severable. The trial court erred by finding that the lessees had to first exhaust their administrative remedies prior to filing a declaratory judgment action. The merits of the contract claim were left for the trial court on remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was reversed as to the constitutional challenge, and Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 58-310A was declared unconstitutional in its entirety. The dismissal of the contract claim was vacated, and that matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it had jurisdiction over the appeal because the parties and the trial court proceeded as if a motion to suppress had been filed by defendant, albeit maybe implicitly, and the trial court granted the motion, and therefore the State had the right to appeal under Idaho App. R. 11(c)(7). The court upheld the trial court's order holding that the methamphetamine was not admissible into evidence because defendant's arrest pursuant to an invalid warrant of attachment violated his rights under Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 17. To overrule Guzman and hold that the exclusionary rule's sole purpose was to deter police misconduct, the court would also have to overrule Arregui, which adopted the exclusionary rule in Idaho in a case in which there was no police misconduct. The court held that the State had not pointed to anything in the record showing that during the last 85 years Arregui had proved to be unwise or unjust.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the plan was invalid because it divided more counties than necessary to comply with federal constitutional requirements. Pursuant to Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 5, and Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 72-1506(5), the total number of divided counties in a legislative redistricting plan had to be the minimum number required to comply with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The Commission had discretion in adopting a redistricting plan that divided counties only to the extent that counties had to be divided to comply with the federal Constitution; moreover, division of counties had to be avoided whenever possible.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The recruiting provision in Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-8504(1)(a) of the Idaho Criminal Gang Enforcement Act (ICGEA), Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-8501 et seq., did not criminalize joining, or advocating for the lawful goals of, an organization that happened to be a criminal gang under the ICGEA. While there might be imaginable instances in which &sect; 18-8504(1)(a) penalized conduct protected under the First Amendment, the statute did not implicate a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. Thus, the recruiting provision was not facially overbroad. Further, because the charging information did not set forth the specific conduct by which defendant allegedly recruited a gang member, and because, by entering an Alford plea, defendant did not admit to any conduct on her part which related to the charge, the appellate court could not ascertain how the recruiting provision was applied to defendant. Thus, defendant failed to show how the recruiting provision was applied to her in a manner that infringed upon her First Amendment rights. Therefore, her conviction pursuant to her conditional plea agreement was upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Third Judicial District, Canyon County, Idaho, determined that the 2009 amendments to the Idaho Sexual Offender Registration Notification and Community Right-to-Know Act (SORA) precluded exemptions from sex offender registration requirements and denied defendant's petition. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the only real issue was whether the Legislature's classification of defendant's offense as an &quot;aggravated offense,&quot; subsequent to his guilty plea, was an exception to the general understanding that SORA was nonpunitive. The fact that a sexual offender, convicted of a certain class of crime, may be required to register for life was not so punitive that it overrode SORA's regulatory purpose. This was particularly so because the Legislature need not make particularized findings in the regulatory context. It was unclear how the 2009 SORA amendments could impair defendant's plea agreement. The 2009 amendments did not attach additional notoriety to his registration status but affected his ability to petition for exemption. He had not been deprived of due process. Sexual offenders seeking SORA exemption under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-8310(1) had to file their petition in a new civil action if their criminal case had been dismissed or fully adjudicated, and the time for appeal had run. The district court had dismissed defendant's case seven years earlier. It lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of defendant's petition.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that the opinions referenced by defendant did not appear to question the wisdom of the statutes or the interpreting opinions. Evidence of mental illness was expressly allowed and could rebut the element of intent. Defendant's right to due process was not infringed by the abolition of the insanity defense. In the absence of an insanity defense, defendant was still able to present a defense. The existing Idaho precedent held that an independent defense of insanity was not required, and that evidence of mental illness could still be used to rebut the intent element of a crime. Defendant's Eighth Amendment protection for cruel and unusual punishment was not violated. The sentence imposed by the district court was within the statutory allowances for second-degree murder, Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-4004.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of the Sixth Judicial District, Bannock County, Idaho, that convicted him of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions because the State failed to show that he inflicted the fatal stab would that killed the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions; the medical examiner testified that 12 of the 30 knife wounds on the victim's body were potentially fatal. Although he was unable to identify the specific wound that caused the victim's death, he testified that she died as a result of more than one of those 12 wounds and indicated that one of those wounds was inflicted by a knife with a non-serrated blade, while the remainder were caused by a knife with a serrated blade. Regardless of which knife defendant used, the evidence permitted the jury to conclude that he inflicted the fatal wound. Further, there was sufficient evidence to convict under an aiding and abetting theory. Both defendant and co-defendant lay in wait for the victim, and two knives were used in the murder, both of which potentially caused the death. Because there was no evidence that a single person, holding both knives, inflicted all of the stab wounds, it was both reasonable and likely for the jury to infer that defendant and co-defendant both stabbed the victim until she died. It was simply unnecessary for the State to prove that defendant inflicted the fatal wound.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting defendant of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and imposing a fixed life sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the road was a public road under R.S. 2477 (1873). There was substantial evidence that the road existed in 1881 and there was substantial evidence from which the Board could infer that the public commonly used the road in 1881. Respondent county had substantial evidence on which to find that the owner could not meet the burden of showing that the road went unused for any five year period. Since 1906, the road had accessed public forest lands, a reasonable basis upon which to infer that the public had been using the road for recreation and wood gathering. The road was not abandoned. The owner's Takings Clause, Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 14 and U.S. Const. amend. V, claim was without merit as neither he nor his predecessors had been deprived of any property. It was in the public interest for the road to be a public highway, Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 40-203A. The county had authority to validate the road even though it intruded into a national forest and could validate it as a fifty-foot wide road, Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 40-2312. The Commissioner did not violate Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 31-807A. Neither party was entitled to attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted an ordinance that created a stormwater utility and imposed a stormwater fee for the operation and maintenance of the stormwater system.

The ordinance contained no pollution control restrictions or other provisions relating to stormwater regulation. The activities funded by the fee included some street maintenance work, and the revenues were not kept segregated from other city funds. The court concluded that the stormwater fee was an unauthorized tax that served the non-regulatory purpose of raising revenue for cleaning, maintaining, and expanding the city's streets and stormwater infrastructure. The benefits provided were a pollutant-free stormwater system and clean streets, which were shared by the general public and were not direct services. The stormwater charge was not a fee incidental to regulation and enacted pursuant to the city's police powers under Idaho Const. art. XII, &sect; 2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute at issue in this case was Idaho Code &sect; 32-717(3), which provides that a court may recognize a grandparent as having the same standing as a parent for evaluating what custody arrangements are in the best interests of the child.

The magistrate carefully considered the best interests of the children, the fact that they had formed a strong bond with their grandmother, and the fact that the father had tried to have a better relationship with them despite some resistance from the grandmother. After considering at length what would be in the best interest of the children, the magistrate concluded that the father should have sole legal custody and he should share physical custody with the grandmother. The magistrate gave due regard to the father's parental rights, but balanced them with the competing interests of the children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Ada County, Idaho, found defendant guilty of two counts of aggravated battery while using a firearm. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the district court's &quot;implicit&quot; finding that the crimes arose out of divisible courses of conduct, and that even if there was, the State had the burden to submit the issue of divisibility to the jury and prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded that a finding of divisibility was not subject to Apprendi v. New Jersey and could be found by the trial judge. The statutory maximum for each crime was 30 years. Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 19-2520E would decrease the statutory maximum penalty as to one of defendant's convictions if both of his crimes arose out of the same divisible course of conduct. Thus, &sect; 19-2520E would operate to reduce defendant's maximum sentence for one of his convictions, not to increase it. As a result, it was within the inherent authority of the trial judge to make a finding regarding the divisibility or indivisibility of defendant's crimes. However, there was no such finding made, and the matter had to be remanded to the district court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the district court for a finding of divisibility or indivisibility of defendant's conduct, followed by sentencing consistent with that finding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant not guilty of lewd conduct with a child under 16 years of age. Without resubmitting the matter to a grand jury, the State filed an amended indictment charging him with sexual abuse of a child under 16 years of age. Defendant was tried by a jury on that charge and found guilty. The court of appeals vacated the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. On review, the court held that because sexual abuse, in violation of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-1506(1)(b), was not a lesser-included offense of lewd conduct, in violation of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-1508, defendant could only be validly charged by indictment with that crime if the matter was resubmitted to a grand jury and it returned an amended indictment. The prosecuting attorney had no authority under Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 8 to issue an amended indictment for a crime that was not charged in the original indictment and that was not an included offense of that crime. Because the amended indictment charged a different crime than the crime charged in the original indictment, the amended indictment was a nullity under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 19-1401.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The settlement agreement addressed the process for informing inmates of bail bond options. The company alleged that accepting bail bond payments by credit card breached the agreement. The court held that a claim under Idaho Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4, which equated to a cause of action for tortious interference with a business relationship, was properly dismissed for lack of timely notice of the claim under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 6-908. The sheriff was entitled to dismissal under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 6-610(4), (5) because the company's filing of a bond one day after it initiated the lawsuit did not comply with the requirement of &sect; 6-610(2) that bond be posted as a condition precedent to suit. Under the doctrine of functus officio, considered in light of Idaho R. Civ. P. 15(c), an amended complaint related back to the date of the original complaint. A public records claim was properly dismissed because the company requested only attorney fees and did not seek the Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 9-343(1) remedy of compelled document production. The county commissioners' supervisory authority under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 31-802 to control other constitutional officers did not extend to the sheriff's bail procedures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of the Seventh Judicial District in and for Bonneville County, Idaho, that convicted him of lewd conduct, arguing that the trial court impermissibly infringed upon his right of self-representation and upon his right to confrontation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with lewd conduct by having oral-genital contact with a child, and he elected to represent himself. The trial court entered an order specifying that the child would testify by closed-circuit television, that defendant was not to speak during the child's testimony, and that standby counsel would voice any objections and cross-examine the child. On review, the court held that, because the child was the only person who could testify to the alleged sexual abuse, requiring defendant to write out questions to be asked by someone else in order to cross-examine the child was a significant impairment of the right to confrontation. Where there was no evidence that testifying in defendant's presence or being cross-examined by defendant would have a devastating emotional effect upon the child or that defendant, if permitted to conduct the cross-examination, would seek to intimidate the child or otherwise abuse the right of cross-examination, the trial court violated defendant's confrontation right and likewise infringed upon his right of self-representation in precluding defendant from cross-examining the complainant himself.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, first-degree kidnapping, and rape. He was sentenced to death for the murder, with consecutive unified fixed life sentences for the kidnapping and rape. The trial court denied his postconviction motion for juror contact. The trial court also denied his postconviction motion to depose an investigator for his trial counsel. On appeal, the court held that the trial court had the inherent authority to enter an order barring contact with the jurors absent prior court approval. The trial court's order did not violate defense counsels' rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. I. Although the trial court erred in finding that Idaho R. Evid. 606(b) restricted the permissible scope of postconviction juror interviews to those topics on which the jurors themselves might testify, it was correct in finding that lines of inquiry related to the jurors' deliberations, mental processes, minds, or emotions were improper. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's request to depose the investigator because the investigator was not a decisionmaker on what evidence was introduced, known, or unknown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Seeking to expand its mining operations, the paving company submitted a single rezone application asking to change the zoning of adjacent agricultural lots to mining and to change the zoning of other undeveloped lots zoned for mining to agriculture.

The court determined that the objecting owners had standing under Idaho Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 10-1201, 10-1202 because they alleged specific harms resulting from the rezoning, rather than from the existing mining activities. The Board acted within its authority under Idaho Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 67-6511, 67-6509, 67-6535(3) and Idaho Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department issued a permit requiring the power company to submit proof that the project had been completed and that the water had been applied to beneficial use by a specified date.

Shortly after the enactment of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 42-203B, which authorized the Department to limit a permit or license involving hydropower rights to a term of years, the Department conducted a beneficial use examination and issued a favorable report. More than two decades later, the Department issued a license that contained a term condition. The court held that the Department did not exceed its statutory authority under &sect; 42-203B by including the term condition because &sect; 42-203B(6), (7) authorized a term condition in a license issued after the statute was enacted, even if such a term was not included in the original permit. The power company did not have a vested right in the water until the license was issued pursuant to Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 42-219.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought an action against defendants, claiming under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 that an involuntary catheterization after he was arrested for DUI violated his constitutional rights. The trial court denied defendants' motions for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that the officer was entitled to qualified immunity from plaintiff's claims under &sect; 1983 because the law regarding forced catheterizations was unsettled. Further, the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss plaintiff's intentional tort claims against defendants. A catheterization was a urine test for drugs present in a suspect's body, and because the parties agreed that there was probable cause to believe that plaintiff was operating a vehicle while under the influence of drugs, he impliedly consented to the catheterization under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-8002(1). Plaintiff failed to satisfy his burden under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 6-903(e) of showing that the officer, who was acting during the course and scope of his employment, acted maliciously or with criminal intent. Because the officer was not liable for any intentional torts against plaintiff, the State Patrol was not vicariously liable either.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, in and for Ada County, Idaho, that convicted him of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver in violation of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 37-2732(a)(1)(B), arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss because his prosecution violated his right to practice his religion, in which marijuana was used as a sacrament.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a search of defendant's home, the police uncovered nine grams of marijuana. Defendant waived his Miranda rights and spoke with officers, telling them that he was an ordained minister and that he provided marijuana to be smoked by his friends as a sacrament. Based upon his admissions, he was charged with possession with intent to distribute. On review, the court held that, while defendant would have been charged with simple possession under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 37-2732(c)(3), a misdemeanor, his admission that he supplied it to others made it the felony offense of possession with intent to distribute. Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 37-2732(a)(1)(B) did not violate defendant's right to practice his religion because the statute was of general application and did not proscribe any conduct engaged in for religious reasons or because of the religious belief it portrays. It was entirely neutral with respect to religion, and it did not directly or indirectly give a preference to any religious denomination or mode of worship. While the states could not regulate religious beliefs, religiously motivated conduct could be regulated under an otherwise valid statute of general application.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. Although the parents claimed that they were not required to show that termination was in the children's best interests as they were the natural parents and the circumstances giving rise to the guardianship had ended, the preclusion of a best interest consideration had been applied to the standard for the appointment of a permanent guardianship rather than termination of a guardianship by removal under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 15-5-212(a). The standard for termination in the statute explicitly included a best interest standard. The guardians were not entitled to attorney's fees under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 12-121 because the parents presented a non-frivolous issue as it was supported by authority from a sister state.</SPAN></P>

The district court denied leave to amend the complaint and awarded attorney fees to the highway district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After installing a fence beside a public road, the owners complained of damage to their fence from the highway district's maintenance work. The court held that the road was a public highway by prescription as defined by Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 40-202(3). Although Idaho Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-203A, 40-1310 contemplated a validation proceeding and action by the highway district, the district court had power to determine whether the road was a public highway. There was no violation of the owners' rights to procedural and substantive due process. A takings claim under the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, was untimely under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 5-224. Because Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 40-2312 established a mandatory width of 50 feet for prescriptive highways and the district's undisputed evidence showed that all maintenance took place within the 50-foot right of way, summary judgment was proper. Because the owners' claims lacked merit, leave to amend under Idaho R. Civ. P. 15(a) was properly denied. The district was entitled to attorney fees under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 12-117 because it was a taxing district pursuant to Idaho Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-1308, 63-3101 and the owners' claims lacked a reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Sixth Judicial District, Bannock County, Idaho, awarded respondent homeowners $896,531.70 in compensatory and punitive damages and the other homeowners $494,033.74, finding appellant realtors liable for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, breach of express or implied contract and unjust enrichment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The realtors argued that the district court erred by denying their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) under Idaho R. Civ. P. 50(b). The supreme court found there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury's verdict and that the homeowners sustained damages as a result of the realtors' conduct. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the realtors' motion for a new trial under Idaho R. Civ. P. 59(a)(5) as the damage award amounts were not so high as to shock the conscience of the court. The supreme court declined to disturb the homeowners' award. The homeowners' assertions of fraud were specifically addressed by the district court. Even if there was error in failing to give the statute of frauds instruction, it was nothing more than harmless error. The investigator's testimony was properly excluded under Idaho R. Evid. 803(8). The homeowners' punitive damages claims were proper. The district court did not err in allowing the homeowners' expert to testify. The punitive damages award was proper. The award of attorney fees to the attorney for his work after he was disqualified from the case was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed, except for the award of attorney fees for work performed by the attorney after he was disqualified from the case; the case was remanded to the district court to eliminate any unwarranted fee award to the attorney. Attorney fees and costs were awarded in favor of the homeowners and against the realtors for the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that there was a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law as required by Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 7-402, a remedy that was available by means of joining an action for declaratory judgment with a request for injunctive relief. The availability of preliminary injunctive relief was sufficiently &quot;speedy&quot; as to warrant denial of the requested writ of prohibition. The legal issues presented by the Attorney General's claims involved the scope of the Land Board's discretion to determine &quot;market rent&quot; as required by Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 58-310A.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties disputed whether the proposed lease agreements would generate market rent as required by Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 58-310A and whether they would obtain the maximum long-term financial return as required by Idaho Const. art. IX, &sect; 8. The court concluded that a writ of prohibition would be inappropriate because there was a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law within the meaning of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 7-402, by means of joining an action for declaratory judgment with a request for injunctive relief. A preliminary injunction under Idaho R. Civ. P. 65(e)(1) was within the scope of the adequate remedies in the ordinary course of law contemplated by &sect; 7-402. The court further observed that the effectiveness of the writ was doubtful because it would not prohibit conduct with regard to future leases, as to which it would have only an advisory effect. In an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, the district court would be in the best position to assess the fundamental factual question of whether the State Board of Land Commissioners had violated its constitutional or statutory duties or whether it had acted within its discretion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also awarded the father attorney fees under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 12-121. On appeal, the court declined to review the issues presented by the mother because she failed to properly support them in her brief, as required by Idaho App. R. 35(a)(6), and failed to properly preserve them in the trial court. The trial court had substantial competent evidence to award custody to the father based on his trial testimony. Because the mother did not provide any admissible evidence to support her defense against the custody modification other than the unsupported allegations presented in her affidavit, and because she failed to attend the trial or any other hearing, the trial court had sufficient evidence to conclude that she acted unreasonably in defending the modification motion. Hence, the trial court did not err in awarding attorney fees to the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized during a search of his automobile after he was arrested on a warrant for failure to appear in court. He entered a conditional plea of guilty to possession of methamphetamine and timely appealed the denial of his suppression motion. The Idaho Court of Appeals affirmed the district court. The state supreme court granted defendant's petition for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a motion to suppress, defendant challenged the search of his car incident to his arrest because the officer did not make contact with defendant until he was already outside of his car. Defendant also argued that the search was illegal under Belton due to the fact that the search was not justified by the concern that defendant would grab a weapon or reach into his truck and destroy evidence. In his argument before the district court, defendant made no mention of the state constitution; therefore, his state constitutional claim was not preserved for review. The Supreme Court of Idaho held that the officer's warrantless search of defendant's truck violated the Fourth Amendment. Defendant was not within reaching distance of the passenger compartment of his truck at the time the officer searched it, nor was it reasonable to believe the truck contained evidence of the offense for which defendant was arrested--failure to appear. The State failed to show that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent debtors claimed that the creditor lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 11-204. The supreme court found that the creditor had standing because a party did not need to be a member of the class excluded from the benefit of a statute in order to have standing. Section 11-204 was unconstitutional, as it treated husbands and wives unequally. The statute no longer conformed with the object of community property law because it required a distinction to be made between the earnings of husband and wives. The creditor cited Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 32-912 to demonstrate that Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 11-204 was contrary to current community property legislation. The debt did not need to benefit the community in order to be satisfied out of the community property. Wives no longer needed the protection provided under &sect; 11-204 and an extension would not serve the legislative purpose because husbands did not need its protection. Attorney fees and costs were awarded to the creditor for its attempt to collect on the judgment on appeal to the district court and the supreme court. Attorney fees were not awarded on appeal under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 12-120(1) and (3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insureds sustained injuries in an automobile collision with an uninsured driver and made demand upon their insurer to pay their medical bills. When the insurer failed to do so, the insureds filed suit. On review, the court held that compensatory damages based upon the insurer's bad faith failure to pay or delay in making payment were proper, as was an award of punitive damages because the insurer's conduct in delaying payment was intentional and not the result of an honest mistake. Its agents testified that they knew from the day following the accident that the insurer would be liable for the insureds' injuries under the policy's uninsured motorist coverage, and the jury could have concluded that the insurer delayed in making payment to take advantage of the insureds' financial vulnerability. However, attorney fees on the claim for future damages was improper under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 41-1839 because the insureds never submitted a claim or proof of loss regarding future damages. Further, the trial court's reduction of punitive damages was affirmed, with no need for a new trial, because the reduction was necessary to satisfy constitutional due process concerns.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that the trial court erred under Idaho R.

However, in light of the extensive testimony of the State's witnesses, as well as evidence regarding the times of the deaths, the manner in which the victims were shot, the setting of a fire in an attempt to conceal the murders, and further testimony regarding defendant's actions on the day of the victims' deaths, the error was harmless because defendant failed to establish that the error would have changed the outcome of the trial. Further, the court rejected the State's challenge and held that resentencing was proper because it could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable jury could have found that the State proved that both victims were killed at the same time as was required by the aggravator under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 19-2515(h)(2) (2000).</SPAN></P>

It was petitioner's burden to present a petition alleging facts that would show that he fit within the exception in Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 19-2719 to avoid summary dismissal; however, the petitioner did not meet that burden. Thus, petitioner's appeal had to be dismissed absent a statutory or constitutional basis for disregarding the application of &sect; 19-2719 to the petition. There was no statutory basis for disregarding the application of &sect; 19-2719 to the petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court held that Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 23-615 was facially unconstitutional because it was both overbroad and vague. The supreme court noted that the district court failed to understand the constitutional parameters of a license to sell alcohol. It was not &sect; 23-615 that directly affected whether a licensee may or may not continue to operate as a retail seller of alcohol. Rather, this provision placed restrictions upon how the licensee may operate his retail alcohol business. Selling alcohol was not constitutionally protected conduct, and thus, statutes that regulated the sale of alcohol could not be challenged as unconstitutionally overbroad. As the licensee's bartender engaged in conduct that was clearly proscribed, &sect; 23-615 was not vague as applied in the case, and the licensee could not complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others. The district court erred in its determination that &sect; 23-615 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant minor was cited for violating Wendell City, Idaho, Ordinance No. 442, a curfew ordinance. The magistrate judge denied his constitutional challenge to the ordinance. Defendant made a conditional admission of guilt. The district court rejected the constitutional challenge. The Court of Appeals of Idaho reversed, finding that the ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad. The state supreme court granted the State's petition for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wendell City, Idaho, Ordinance No. 442 prohibited a minor from being in public from 11:00 p.m. till 5:00 a.m. When defendant was charged with violating the ordinance, he argued that the ordinance constituted an impermissible restriction on free speech. The Supreme Court of Idaho held that the ordinance was a valid enactment within the power of the City of Wendell under Idaho Const. art. XII, &sect; 2. The ordinance served the government's interest in keeping juveniles off the streets, which was unrelated to the suppression of expression. The ordinance did not reach an amount of conduct that was greater than necessary to further the City of Wendell's interests in the physical well-being of minors. As a result, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. The ordinance did not result in the deprivation of a fundamental right, such as a minor's freedom of movement. Because defendant failed to show a bar to his father's ability to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance, he could not assert a deprivation of parental liberty interests in the matter.</SPAN></P>

A witness testified that she admitted to being ready and willing to reveal what a codefendant had told her. Defendant did not show that he could have obtained possession of the notes and billing records from codefendant's attorneys at an earlier date. Defendant failed to show that the participation of the trial judge in codefendant's alleged secret deal was not known when he filed his first petition. Defendant failed to establish that he did not know a witness had acted as a paid informant. Defendant did not show why Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 19-2719 was inapplicable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, petitioners, individuals convicted of criminal offenses who received capital sentences, challenged orders issued by the various Idaho district courts that dismissed their successive petitions for post-conviction relief, arguing that the U.S. Supreme Court's Ring ruling was to be applied retroactively and that they were entitled to relief under Ring.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, petitioners contended that they were entitled to a new trial because, in each of their respective cases, the trial judge determined the existence of mitigating factors sufficient to support the imposition of the death penalty, while the Supreme Court's Ring ruling concluded that the jury trial guarantee under the Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VI, required that the jury find an aggravating circumstance necessary to impose the death penalty instead of the judge. On review, the court adopted the Teague retroactivity test for criminal cases on collateral review and held that the Supreme Court's ruling in Ring announced a new procedural rule that did not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review. Ring established a new procedural rule because it altered the range of permissible methods for determining whether a defendant's conduct was punishable by death. The ruling did not establish a substantive rule because it did not alter the range of conduct subjected to the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor argued that the district court erred in holding that she could not challenge the 2005 Order.

The only contention was that she failed to comply with the 2005 Order. In its 2006 Order, the Board imposed a new five-year license suspension commencing on April 19, 2006. The Board's action either extended the doctor's suspension for three years or for one year. The next issue was whether the Board had the authority to impose a new sanction for violating its prior order. There was on provision of the statutes or of any rule adopted by the Board that authorized &quot;additional disciplinary action&quot; for violating an order issued by the Board.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with and convicted of offenses relating to the murder of his ex-wife and her boyfriend. On review, the court held that, although the trial court erred under Idaho R. Evid. 803(3) in allowing six witnesses to testify to statements made by the victim, defendant's ex-wife, expressing her fear that defendant was going to harm her, the error was harmless because any guilt that may have stemmed from the victim's out-of-court statements was outweighed by testimony regarding defendant's own statements expressing his desire to kill the victim, along with the testimony of his co-conspirators and the forensic evidence regarding the murders and the arson. The court rejected the State's challenge to the granting of post-conviction relief. Defendant's death sentence was required to be set aside by the U.S. Supreme Court's Ring ruling, which held that the Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, Boy Scouts of America (BSA), appealed an order of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County, Idaho, that denied its motion to dismiss under Idaho R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), arguing that the district court erred in finding that the claims of plaintiffs, former boy scouts, were not barred by the statute of limitations pursuant to Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 6-1704.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Former boy scouts filed suit against BSA, alleging that they had been molested by their scout leader. BSA moved to dismiss, arguing that the claims were barred by Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 6-1701. On review of the order denying BSA's motion, the court held that the parties and the district court were erroneous in presuming that Idaho Code tit. 6, ch. 17, applied. The legislation created a cause of action for children harmed by sexual conduct, but no such cause of action existed when the former boy scouts were victimized by their scout leader. Because the liability imposed under Idaho Code tit. 6, ch. 17, substantially differed from that formerly available, the statutory scheme could not be retroactively applied. Regardless of when the former boy scouts' cause of action accrued, the statute could not be applied to conduct that occurred at least six years before the statutory scheme was enacted, and BSA could not be held accountable for behavior that was not actionable at the time it occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court order refusing dismissal was reversed, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

III, &sect; 20. Plaintiffs sought appellate attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought an action against defendants to have Idaho Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 67-429B and 67-429C declared unconstitutional as violating Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 20. Plaintiffs asserted that they became addicted to gambling by playing the video gaming machines at a casino located on an Indian reservation. Plaintiffs claimed that because of their gambling addictions, they each lost tens of thousands of dollars and suffered stress, anxiety, humiliation, and emotional distress. The trial court granted the State's motion to dismiss the action. On appeal, the court determined that a judgment entered in a federal case regarding whether video gaming machines were permitted on the reservation was final and would be res judicata in any further litigation between the State and the tribes as to whether tribal video gaming was permissible. The fact that the State did not raise the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 67-429B and 67-429C in the federal case did not prevent res judicata from barring future litigation. A judgment for plaintiffs that declared that the statutes were unconstitutional would not result in a substantial likelihood that video gaming machines would be removed from the casino.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court denied plaintiffs' request for appellate attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council adopted an ordinance that approved the agency's plan to construct an urban renewal project and finance the project. On appeal, the citizen argued the Local Economic Development Act, Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 50-2901 et seq., violated limitations on actions by municipalities. The citizen argued that an urban renewal agency's use of revenue allocation financing was really an action by a city -- that agencies were merely alter egos&quot; of their cities -- and thus urban renewal agencies' use of revenue allocation financing violated Idaho Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 3 and 4. The supreme court determined that urban renewal agencies were not the alter egos of cities. Therefore, the Act's grant of authority to urban renewal agencies to issue revenue allocation bonds did not violate Idaho Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 3 or 4. The agencies' brief demonstrated that cities across the State had financed over 60 projects through revenue allocation financing in the 27 years since the supreme court issued previous caselaw on the subject. This widespread reliance on the supreme court's holding that urban renewal agencies were not alter egos of cities was well-justified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth Judicial District Court, Ada County, Idaho, dissolved the parties' marriage and granted them joint legal and physical custody of their child, with appellant mother having primary physical custody and respondent father having reasonable visitation upon completing additional counseling and a polygraph.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the mother raised several issues challenging the trial court's judgment. The supreme court found that because the mother chose to remain silent during the entirety of the trial proceedings, the supreme court could consider very few of the issues she raised on appeal. Many of her arguments had no citations to any evidence in the record or relevant legal authority, and were thus barred under Idaho App. R. 35(a)(6). She also failed to raise many of her arguments before the trial court and was thus barred from raising them on appeal. Because the mother failed to present evidence of her claim that the father was a habitual perpetrator of domestic violence to the magistrate court and did not raise any objection during trial, she failed to preserve this issue for appeal; furthermore, the father the father presented ample evidence to rebut the presumption of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 32-717B(5). As it was frivolous for the mother to argue on appeal that the father should not have been granted joint custody when that was the only request that the mother properly made before the magistrate court, the father was entitled to attorney fees on appeal pursuant to Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 12-121.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the county built a new courthouse, the city agreed to share the facilities and to reimburse the county for expenses.

By analogy to permanent mandatory injunctions, the court concluded that the city had a burden to show good and sufficient cause for setting aside the &sect; 1-2218 order and that it had not met its burden. No significant change in circumstances arose from new case law precluding district judges from ordering a city to reimburse a county for use of county-owned facilities, which did not prohibit voluntary agreements for reimbursement; from the construction of the county courthouse; or from the county's receipt of fees collected under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 31-3201A. Section 1-2218 did not impose a tax within the meaning of Idaho Const. art. VII, &sect; 5.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county, through its board of commissioners, did not grant or deny any permit. It simply held that the landowner's property was located within the mountain overlay district and that a site alteration permit was required. The landowner did not apply for such a permit and thus he had not exhausted all remedies under the county code. Both Idaho Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 67-6519, 67-6521 provided for judicial review only after all remedies had been exhausted under local ordinance. Because the landowner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing his petition for judicial review, the court had to vacate the trial court's ruling and remand with instructions to dismiss the petition for judicial review without prejudice. Because the landowner had not prevailed on appeal, he was not entitled to an award of attorney fees under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 12-117. Because the court dismissed the appeal on an issue not raised by either party, the court declined to award fees to the county.</SPAN></P>

The ranchers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ranchers argued that the hearing officer should have disqualified herself in response to the December 13, 2004 motion to disqualify they made pursuant to Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 67-5252. The supreme court found that the ranchers did not move to disqualify the hearing officer until just two days before the hearing was scheduled to occur. The motion was untimely filed and properly denied. The hearing officer had no authority to hear a challenge to the validity of the Department's regulation based on the rule being outside of the Department's rulemaking authority. The hearing officer's decision to exclude certain evidence as lacking proper foundation or relevancy did not violate the ranchers' due process rights, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, as they had notice and an opportunity to be heard. The issues of whether the regulations were invalid and whether Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 25-3708 was constitutional were not properly before the supreme court. The award of attorney fees and costs to the Department was improper, Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 12-117(1). The Department was entitled to costs and fees on appeal, Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 12-117.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants submitted an application to subdivide 115 acres of real property in Blaine County, Idaho. The Board of County Commissioners found that the areas of disturbance on two of the four lots in the proposed subdivision encroached upon the Mountain Overlay District (MOD). The intent of the MOD was to direct development away from the mountains. The Board issued a lengthy, written decision denying the application. The district court did not err by affirming the Board's decision. The Supreme Court of Idaho held that the Board had the sole authority to make final decisions on subdivision applications and its decision was supported by substantial evidence. The Board was not estopped from enforcing the MOD ordinance, because a planning and zoning staff member originally believed that the subdivision was outside the MOD. The MOD ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague, and appellant's due process rights were not violated by the Commissioner's site visit. The Board's decision was not arbitrary and capricious and did not violate appellant's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner father appealed a judgment of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County (Idaho) affirming the suspension of the father's driver's license for failure to pay court-ordered child support, pursuant to the Family Law License Suspensions Act (FLLSA), Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 7-1401 to 7-1417, in a license suspension proceeding commenced by respondent Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department suspended the father's driver's license for non-payment of court-ordered child support for three children under three separate orders. The father contended that the Department did not have authority to commence license suspension proceedings against him under the FLLSA and that the FLLSA was applied to all three of his child support orders ex post facto. The court found that the Department substantially complied with the requirements of FLLSA, Idaho Code &sect; 7-1404, to commence the license suspension proceedings. There were no ex post facto violations, under Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 16 or under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, cl. 3, because the FLLSA did not invoke criminal jurisprudence. A retrospective argument was inapplicable because the father's child support arrearages were in excess of the amount that provided the Department with grounds to initiate license suspension proceedings, under Idaho Code &sect; 7-1404. A driver's license was not an exempt property interest under the FLLSA, Idaho Code &sect; 7-1402(5). The Department's request for attorney fees on appeal, under Idaho Code &sect; 12-121, was denied because the matter was one of first impression.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court, denied the Department's request for attorney fees on appeal, and assessed costs to the Department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a developer, appealed the order of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Ada County, dismissing its complaint against defendants, the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) and the Board of ITD, for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer presented a preliminary plat of a subdivision. Because the plat called for an internal street to intersect with a controlled-access highway, ITD required that the developer obtain an encroachment permit. The ITD approved the encroachment permit with the condition that the developer design and construct a traffic signal. The cost was estimated at $ 180,000. After the new road was built and the traffic signal was installed but not operational, the developer sued ITD for reimbursement of the expense of constructing the traffic signal. The district court erred by dismissing the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The Supreme Court of Idaho held that while judicial review of ITD's action on an encroachment permit application was governed by the APA, the applicable rules did not provide a mechanism whereby an applicant whose permit application had been approved subject to conditions could challenge those conditions. The Supreme Court of Idaho also held that it was not an impermissible tax for the ITD to impose the condition of erecting a traffic signal as a requirement for a developer seeking an encroachment permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an interpleader action initiated by plaintiff insurance company, defendant-appellant, the wife of the insured, challenged summary judgment granted by the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District (Idaho) in favor of defendant-respondent, an irrevocable trust established in the insured's name, arguing that the district court erred in finding that the trust was entitled to the proceeds of the insured's life insurance policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the deceased insured's wife and the trust filed competing claims to life insurance proceeds, the insurance company filed an interpleader action so that the district court could determine to whom it should pay the proceeds. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the district court granted that of the trust. On review, the court held that the district court erred in concluding that there was no genuine issue as to the character of the final premium payment, that the premium had been paid with the insured's separate property, and that the policy was the insured's separate property. The character of the payment was a material fact that controlled the disposition of the case, and there was conflicting evidence regarding the donor's intent in giving funds to the insured to pay the insurance premium. If the district court determined on remand that the policy was the insured's separate property, then the wife was not entitled to the funds. If the policy was community property, then the wife was entitled to one-half of the proceeds, and the remaining one half, as the insured's share of the community property, belonged to the trust as the policy's named beneficiary.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was not afforded the opportunity to review confidential parole commission notes that were included in the sealed file. Defendant demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel where he was prejudiced by counsel's failure to timely assert defendant's claim that he was denied due process in the VSP designation process; in failing to timely assert a challenge to the Board's failure to adopt and apply objective criteria for VSP designation; and in failing to properly preserve defendant's due process challenge to the judicial review process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was incarcerated for a rape of a fifteen-year-old girl, in violation of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-6101(1). Prior to his release, the Board classified him as a VSP, based on a psychosexual evaluation conducted under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-8317 and petitioner's admissions to uncharged offenses. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court upheld the Board's decision. The court concluded that the designation of VSP was not constitutionally sound. Petitioner was denied procedural due process, including notice and opportunity to be heard, because he was not afforded access to the complete contents of the record before the district court. Petitioner had a statutory right to effective assistance of counsel in an appeal from the Board's designation as a VSP, pursuant to Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-8319(2)(d). HIs counsel should have presented petitioner's challenges that he was denied due process in the VSP designation process and that the Board failed to apply objective criteria, pursuant to the guidelines set forth in Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-8314(5). This deficient performance resulted in prejudice to petitioner.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals of Idaho vacated defendant's convictions after determining that defendant's motion to suppress should have been granted. The State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after a police officer found methamphetamine in a bag he was carrying. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to suppress the evidence because the officer's frisk of defendant was unlawful, as a reasonable person would not conclude that defendant posed a risk of danger. The officer's encounter with defendant took place in public while it was still light out and there was no suggestion that defendant was stopped in a high crime area. The officer's subjective feelings could not be relied on to justify the frisk, and evidence that defendant was acting nervous and may have been under the influence of a narcotic did not justify the frisk. Because the frisk was unlawful, it was not a duty under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-705 and defendant was entitled to peacefully refuse the frisk. Because defendant peacefully refused the frisk by merely turning around and telling the officer &quot;no,&quot; the officer did not have probable cause to arrest defendant for obstructing an officer, and therefore the arrest was unlawful, and the methamphetamine that was seized after that unlawful arrest should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the district court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress incriminating statements he made to police because defendant's statement &quot;I don't think I should answer that&quot; was not sufficiently clear such that a reasonable officers would understand it as an invocation of the right to remain silent, and therefore the officer had no duty to discontinue his questioning. In addition, the district court's conclusion that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to remain silent was supported by the evidence, including testimony from officers and medical personnel that defendant knew where he was, knew what day it was, answered questions accurately, and that his aspirin level did not require hospitalization and that he was not given any medication that would interfere with his mental processes. The court held that counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to suppress an eyewitness' identification of defendant because there was no state action and no police suggestiveness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ada County, Idaho, acquired property for a development project. A college foundation sub-leased a portion of the property. The foundation executed a memorandum of understanding with several civic entities, providing that the foundation, which was a tax-exempt entity, would make certain payments to help pay for improvements. Upon termination of the memorandum of understanding, the parties entered into a reconciliation agreement. The foundation filed suit against the lessor, the developer, and the civic entities, seeking a declaratory judgment of its obligations under the agreement. The lessor was the prevailing party on the foundation's claim that it had no legal obligation to make payments in lieu of taxes; the district court did not err by granting partial summary judgment against the foundation. The reconciliation agreement contained a merger clause, and it was unambiguous. The Supreme Court of Idaho upheld the district court's ruling that the lessor was entitled to an award of $ 213,600.95 in attorney fees under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 12-120(3), as it was the prevailing party in an action arising out of a commercial transaction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the magistrate did not abuse his discretion by denying the mother's request to modify the custody order because: (1) the magistrate considered factors relevant to whether a custodial parent should be permitted to relocate with a child, including the mother's motive for the move, the extent alternative visitation would allow the father and his daughter to maintain a close relationship, and the effect of the move on the daughter's extended family; (2) the magistrate did not apply an irrebuttable presumption against the physical separation of a child and a non-custodial parent; and (3) the magistrate's findings of fact and conclusions of law were supported by the evidence. The court further held that the custody order did not violate the mother's constitutional right to travel because the restriction on the mother's right to travel was necessary to serve a compelling state interest, namely the daughter's best interest. The magistrate found that the move was not in the daughter's best interest and there was no less restrictive alternative to achieve the state's objective.</SPAN></P>

III, &sect; 16. The supreme court concluded that the statute referred to where notice must be published, by governmental and non-governmental entitites alike, and not who was publishing the notice. As a result, the statute applied to both entities. The substance of the statute with respect to non-governmental entities was void because the substantive change was not indicated in the title.

The company appealed; the District cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 67-4902, 67-4904, and 67-4922A did not authorize the District to market facilities that it did not own or operate and the legislature intended Idaho Code &sect; 67-4902 to encourage local communities to build public facilities. The supreme court found that &sect; 67-4902 defined &quot;auditorium or community center district&quot; and Idaho Code &sect; 67-4912 enumerated the powers of the district's board. An auditorium district may build a facility that did not exist in its district, such as a convention center. The provisions of Idaho Code &sect; 67-4904, as codified in 1998, did not reflect a legislative intent to expand the purposes or powers of an auditorium district. An auditorium district did not have the power to simply market public facilities within its borders. The District was not entitled to an award of attorney fees. The company was declined attorney fees as the District did not act without a reasonable basis in fact or law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Idaho Industrial Commission, adopting a referee's proposed finding that appellant employee had failed to meet a requirement of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 72-701 by failing to notify respondent employer of the employee's fall at work within 60 days of the fall, dismissed the employee's worker's compensation claim.</SPAN></P>

Under the plain and unambiguous wording in Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 72-701 and Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 72-102(18)(b), a worker's compensation claimant was required to give notice of an accident within 60 days after it occurred and not within 60 days after the claimant became aware that the accident had caused a personal injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County (Idaho), which convicted him of first-degree murder, kidnapping, robbery, and rape and summarily denied all but one of his claims for post-conviction relief. Respondent State cross-appealed the district court's order setting aside defendant's death sentence on post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant abducted, raped and murdered the victim, dumped her body in a drainage tank, and stole her car and credit cards. Reviewing the death penalty case in accordance with Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 19-2827, the court found no errors at the trial level. There was substantial evidence that defendant's waiver of his right to remain silent during the investigation was made voluntarily. Unlike the guilt phase, the court found reversible errors in the sentencing trial and accordingly vacated defendant's sentence. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the nature and high volume of inadmissible victim impact statements, which the trial court did not limit to the victim's family, contributed to defendant's sentence. The State argued that the district court erred by vacating defendant's death sentence on post-conviction relief because the jury found facts sufficient to make defendant death eligible. The jury's determination of the aggravating circumstance under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 19-2515(h)(7) (2000) was all that was necessary to increase defendant's potential sentence to death. On remand, the district court should examine mitigating factors to determine if the death penalty would be unjust.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, but vacated defendant's sentence. The court remanded to the district court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by dismissing his motion for postconviction relief because he was mentally retarded, and therefore, not eligible for execution. The supreme court disagreed. One requirement of proving mental retardation was that petitioner had an IQ of 70 or below at the time of the murders and prior to his eighteenth birthday. He did not offer any expert opinion showing that he did. He likewise did not offer any expert opinion stating that he was mentally retarded at the time of the murders or prior to age eighteen. The record reflected only one IQ score for petitioner. He scored an IQ of 72 when he was twenty-eight years old. There was no expert testimony opining what petitioner's IQ probably would have been eleven years earlier. Petitioner was found to be competent to stand trial. In an expert's opinion, petitioner understood the charges against him and their potential consequences and he was capable of assisting in his defense. Petitioner had the capacity to enter into a state of mind which was an element of the offense for which he was charged. Petitioner did not challenge on appeal the finding that he was competent to stand trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County, Idaho, granted judgment in favor of respondent Ada County Highway District (ACHD) to quiet title asserting it had acquired a highway over a portion of appellant property owner's property between the prior location of the fence and the current location of the fence under Idaho Code &sect; 40-202 and an action for ejectment of the relocated fence. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that ACHD did not meet the elements of Idaho Code &sect; 40-202, its quiet title action was barred by Idaho Code &sect; 5-202. The supreme court found that a maintenance had been performed by ACHD continuously and as necessary from 1978 on. The strip in question was used frequently by adjacent landowners and individuals accessing the businesses and, therefore, supported a conclusion of extensive public use. Because ACHD brought the action within ten years of the encroachment, the suit was not barred by Idaho Code &sect; 5-202. The record did not contain a decision by the district court regarding spoliation. Idaho Code &sect; 40-202 was not unconstitutional on its face. The landowner had four years from the accrual of the cause of action to bring a claim of inverse condemnation. The owner was not entitled to a jury trial on ACHD's ejectment claim. There was no waiver and the unclean hands doctrine did not preclude ACHD from quieting title in the roadway or requiring the owner to remove the encroaching fence. The owner had notice and the opportunity to be heard. The owner failed to meet its burden to show the indispensability of the city, federal government, power company, or the bank.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed, holding first that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury further on the definition of vaginal opening because two physicians explained for the jury where the vaginal opening was, the victim testified that defendant penetrated her vagina with his penis, and defendant admitted to a police officer that he had done so. Further, the victim's testimony and defendant's confession provided evidence upon which a reasonable trier of fact could have found that defendant penetrated the victim's vaginal opening with his penis. Contrary to defendant's assertion, Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-6101(1) did not violate the state or federal equal protection provisions; nor did the sexual offender registration requirements of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-8304(4) violate protections against cruel and unusual punishment as the requirements did not impose punishment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One requirement of proving mental retardation under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 19-2515A was that the inmate had an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 70 or below at the time of the murders and prior to his 18th birthday. He did not offer any expert opinion stating that he was mentally retarded at the time of the murders and prior to the age of 18. In its briefing opposing the inmate's motion for summary judgment, the State argued that the inmate had failed to provide evidence that his IQ was 70 or below and failed to provide evidence showing it was 70 or below prior to his 18th birthday. The inmate's alleged IQ was obviously a matter requiring expert testimony; however, the inmate did not offer any expert testimony opining that his IQ was ever 70 or below, nor did he allege that the additional testing he requested intended to address that issue. Whether or not a person was mentally retarded was obviously a matter requiring an expert's opinion, but he did not offer any expert testimony on that issue.

The supreme court found that securities agents like the employee had an obligation to make certain records available upon reasonable request by the Department. The records to be made available for audit and inspection were those required to be maintained in Idaho Code &sect; 30-14-411(c). Even though the employee was not personally required to make or maintain the records outlined in subsection (c), she was required to surrender those documents for inspection pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 30-14-411(d).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the e-mails in question were public records pursuant to Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 9-337(13). The e-mails contained information relating to the conduct and administration of the public's business. The public had a legitimate interest in these communications between the prosecutor and the employee because the prosecutor defended the employee's management of a county program when an investigation of the program's finances was started by the board of county commissioners. The e-mails were not exempt from disclosure under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 9-340C because they were informal communications between an employee and her supervisor, unrelated to personnel administration. The employee had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the e-mails. The settlement agreement between the county's insurer and the employee was properly sealed. The settlement was executed in order to conclude any potential claims between the employee and the county. Under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 9-340D(11) only statistical data and the actual amount paid were public records. Any other information contained in the settlement or other records relating to the employee's claim were exempt from disclosure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company sought judicial review of an order from the Commission that the company and members of the Idaho Petroleum Marketers Association were not entitled to a refund of transfer fees paid into the fund for periods before October 1, 1999. The trial court upheld the Commission's interpretation of the Idaho Petroleum Clean Water Trust Fund Act, Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 41-4901 et seq., finding that the Commission could not suspend transfer fees until the Director of the Idaho Department of Insurance had determined that the cap had been reached. The company later filed a request with the Commission for a refund of fees. The Commission denied the request. The trial court ruled that the company's action was barred by res judicata. On appeal, the court found that the issue of whether the company was entitled to a refund was previously resolved. The company was barred from litigating the issue further. The Commission did not waive its right to rely on res judicata when it entered a stipulation to stay the claims of other petroleum distributors; the Commission was simply agreeing that it would go forward with the case against the oil company first, and obtain a resolution through appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a decision from the District Court of the Sixth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Bannock County, which dismissed his consolidated successive petitions for post-conviction relief, petition for a writ of habeas corpus, a motion to correct an illegal sentence, a motion to vacate a sentence of death, and a motion for a new sentencing trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's murder and robbery convictions were affirmed on direct appeal. Later, the district court denied his request for several types of relief. The cases were consolidated, and this appeal followed. In dismissing, the supreme court determined that appellant had one opportunity to raise all challenges to the capital conviction and sentence under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 19-2719(2), except in unusual cases where it was demonstrated that the issues were not known and reasonably could not have been known in the 42-day time frame in &sect;&nbsp;19-2719(3). Section 19-2719 was not unconstitutional as violative of equal protection and due process of law. Moreover, it was not unconstitutionally vague because it identifies two possibilities under a clear single standard. Moreover, appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims were untimely under &sect; 19-2719(5) because they were raised three years after his appellate briefing. Res judicata barred his argument regarding the failure to supply a mitigation expert. Finally, the motion to correct the sentence under Idaho Crim. R. 35 was untimely because the time periods in Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 19-2719(3) applied instead.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Fifth Judicial District, Gooding County, Idaho, granted judgment in favor of respondents, water districts and corporations, finding that the Rules for Conjunctive Management of Surface and Ground Water Resources (CM Rules) lacked certain procedural components necessary to the proper administration of water rights. Appellant Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) and intervenor company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that its review would be in terms of the CM Rules' constitutionality on their face and not in terms of their &quot;threatened application&quot; or &quot;as applied.&quot; The issue was whether the challenged provisions were void in all possible applications, or whether there were a set of circumstances in which they may be constitutionally applied. The failure to explicitly recite certain procedural components such as the burdens of proof did not make the CM Rules unconstitutional. The Rules could be constitutionally applied to provide for the timely delivery of water. There was no basis for setting aside the CM Rules based upon the lack of specifically articulated time standards. The CM Rules did not unconstitutionally force a senior water rights holder to re-adjudicate a right, nor did they fail to give adequate consideration to a partial decree. The CM Rules were not unconstitutional in permitting some discretion in the IDWR Director to determine whether the carryover water was reasonably necessary for future needs. There was no requirement that the CM Rules had to incorporate every possible remedy to a senior who felt that his water right had been improperly reduced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to the finding of unconstitutionality; the district court's revocation of the city's motion to intervene was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District and a judge, appointed a special master to assist with the &quot;remedial phase&quot; of litigation related to the funding of public schools by petitioner, the State of Idaho. The district court charged the State with payment of the special master fees, and the State sought a writ of prohibition under Idaho Const. art. V, &sect; 9, to enjoin the district court from assessing said fees against it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court hired a special master under Idaho R. Civ. P. 53(a)(1) to conduct a survey of every school district in Idaho to determine the extent of the buildings needing repair as well as the most cost-effective method of addressing the hazards they presented. The State claimed that the district court exceeded its jurisdiction in ordering the State to bear the costs. The court found that a writ of prohibition was not proper because the appointment of a special master and the assessment of costs under Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(d) fell within the discretion of the district court. Because the issues were identical to those raised on direct appeal, the court treated the matter as a direct appeal and upheld the award of fees against the State. Idaho Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-101 and 12-121, as well as Idaho R. Civ. P. 53, provided clear authority for the award of costs for the special master. Further, Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 12-118 provided the relevant direction as to how costs awarded against the State were to be paid. Finally, the court denied the request for attorney fees by intervenors under the private attorney general doctrine because the issue was not a matter of substantial public policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the writ of prohibition, addressed the case as if on direct appeal, affirmed the district court's award of costs against the State, and found a statutory basis for the award. The court awarded costs on appeal to the district court and the judge and denied the request for attorney fees by intervenors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband challenged a decision from the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, State of Idaho, Elmore County, which granted partial judgment in favor of respondent primary beneficiary in a life insurance dispute and determined that the husband was not entitled to any of the proceeds. It also held that the estate was entitled to half of the proceeds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband attempted to get the proceeds of a term life insurance policy. However, he was merely listed as the contingent beneficiary. The proceeds were deposited with the trial court. One-half was given to the beneficiary. After the husband was convicted of first degree murder, the district court ruled that the other half should pass to the decedent's estate as the husband was barred from receiving his share under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 15-2-803. This appeal followed. In partially affirming, the supreme court determined that &sect; 15-2-803(e) did not apply to this case because the proceeds in question were not characterized as community property. It was a term life insurance policy; the husband had no vested interest in such until the death of his wife. However, there was an alternative reason for the district court's decision. Section 15-2-803(b), (n) prohibited the husband from acquiring any benefit as a result of the death of his wife. Next, the criminal appeal had no effect on the case. The husband provided no basis for his argument that &sect; 15-2-803 amounted to an unconstitutional taking. Finally, neither party was entitled to attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision to grant summary judgment was affirmed. The decision that one-half of the policy passed to the decedent's estate was reversed. The supreme court held that the entire policy passed according to the terms of the policy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several petitions for review were filed, which the district court consolidated. The property developer planned to subdivide and develop home sites on a parcel located adjacent to the landowner's property. At issue on appeal were: (1) alleged due process violations; (2) alleged arbitrary and capricious actions; and (3) alleged unsupported decisions. The arguments related to the developer's first application were moot. The landowner, however, did have standing to allege an injury. The Board correctly argued that Idaho Code &sect; 67-6535(b) did not apply to decisions of the planning and zoning commission. Also, the Board did comply with &sect; 67-6535(b). The landowner's due process rights were not violated by the limitation of public comments. Although notices for two meetings were defective, the landowner failed to show prejudice. Next, the supreme court had never adopted the appearance of fairness doctrine with respect to due process. Next, the supreme court could not find that the Board's interpretation was arbitrary or capricious. The Board also reasonably applied Section 402 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1342. The evidence the Board chose to rely on was substantial and competent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the Board's approval of the application for a Class II permit. Neither party was awarded attorney's fees on appeal. Costs were awarded to the Board.</SPAN></P>

The city was obligated to follow its own ordinance. The city clerk's review was limited to form only, and nothing gave the clerk authority to review it for validity or constitutionality. Next, the district court erred by ruling on the declaratory judgment action under Idaho Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;10-1201 because whether the initiative concerned matters outside the scope of such was not ripe for adjudication since it was a pre-election challenge. Finally, the city was not entitled to attorney fees as it was not the prevailing party, and the presenters were not entitled to such fees on appeal since there was a reasonable basis for the city's action under Idaho Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;12-117.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the issue was whether the initiative process should be interpreted by the court to consider the validity of the initiative on an otherwise qualified initiative petition prior to submission to the voters. The initiative process arose from Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 1, and extended to the cities by legislative mandate, Idaho Code &sect; 50-501. The initiative process was a mandate that enabled voters to address issues of concern. The initiative might not pass in which case the issue of whether it stepped over the bounds of a proper initiative would be moot. The initiative might pass and be the proper subject of an adjudication, or the city council might exercise its authority and amend or reject it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth Judicial District Court, Ada County, Idaho, reversed the decision of the Idaho Personnel Commission (Commission) in denying respondent employee attorney fees and prejudgment interest on the employee's wrongful discharge case against appellant Idaho Department of Correction (IDOC). IDOC appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that as the employee chose not to make the argument about why Idaho Code &sect; 12-117 might support a fee award against IDOC, it would not address the statute further. Rule 201, Idaho Admin. Code 15.04.01.201.10, was not an independent basis for a fee award, but only described the procedure to be followed if there was a statutory basis for such an award. The Commission did not err in ruling it did not have authority under Idaho Code &sect; 12-121 to award fees as the proceedings were not a civil action commenced by the filing of a complaint as required by Idaho R. Civ. P. 3(a). Idaho Code &sect; 67-5316(4) specifically mentioned reinstatement, with or without loss of pay. Nothing in that phrase would lead to the conclusion the legislature also intended to include an award of attorney fees as a possible &quot;other remedy.&quot; The employee presented no arguments as to whether any of the statutes were unconstitutional. Neither the general law on interest, Idaho Code &sect; 28-22-104, nor the general language of Idaho Code &sect; 67-5316(4) overcame the presumption of IDOC's sovereign immunity from an award of prejudgment interest. The employee was not entitled to an award of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, in and for Ada County, held that article III, &sect; 12 did not apply to meetings of legislative committees, and the press club appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the supreme court was whether article III, &sect; 12 required all meetings of legislative committees to be open to the public. The task was solely to decide whether the constitution required that they must be open. &quot;Expressio unius est exclusio alterius&quot; applied as a rule of construction. The press club correctly admitted that the ability to close committee meetings was never discussed or raised by the constitutional delegates when framing the constitution; however, the press club contended that the phrase &quot;business of each house&quot; should be construed to include legislative committees. Nevertheless, the supreme court recognized that there were problems with the press club's argument that because each house utilized legislative committees in order to function, the work of such committees was included in the phrase &quot;business of each house.&quot; The supreme court concluded that, using the recognized rules of construction, Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 12 did not apply to legislative committee meetings. Where the constitution did not limit the power of the legislature to close its legislative committee meetings, the supreme court did not have the power to order that they be open.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff organization sought a declaratory judgment against defendant Idaho State Lottery Commission, finding that an amendment to the gaming tracking provision was not enacted in substantial compliance with the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act. The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, for Ada County denied the requested relief. The organization appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case arose from 2001 amendments to the Gaming Rules, Idaho Admin. Code r. 52.01.02 for bingo which, among other things, required bingo operators to track all bingo paper used. The organization argued that Idaho Admin. Code r. 52.01.02.106.01 (Rule 106.01) was void because the Lottery failed to provide sufficient notice prior to enacting the rule and because the Lottery failed to maintain an adequate rulemaking record. These issues were moot. Also, the organization did not have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of these issues. As to the organization's argument that Rule 106.01 was unconstitutionally vague, this contention also failed. While the Gaming Update was not legally enforceable, it did provide guidance in the interpretation of the Gaming Rules. Additionally, Rule 106.01 was better understood when read with the other provisions of Idaho Admin. Code r. 52.01.02.106. When considering these rules, a practical interpretation of Rule 106.01 was that bingo operators could track and group the bingo papers used per session according to their appropriate designation. The Lottery was not required to prescribe a form for the Rule 106.01 paper tracking requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the district court's order denying the request to declare paper tracking requirements void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee challenged defendant county's termination of her employment. The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District for Ada County, Idaho, affirmed a hearing officer's decision. The employee filed a second complaint alleging civil rights violations. A third suit was later filed seeking repayment of wages. The county filed suit, seeking to collect an overpayment of wages. The employee appealed, and all the matters were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, the district court's decision was vacated, and the claims were dismissed on appeal. In the second case, the district court denied the employee's petition for judicial review. Summary judgment for the county was granted in the third and fourth cases. The suits arose out of the alleged overpayment of wages that were deposited into the employee's personal account. On appeal, the supreme court determined that the civil rights actions, based on 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, were properly dismissed because they were time barred; however, an award of attorney fees arising out of these claims was not appropriate. The denial of the employee's request to review the Ada County Board of Commissioners decision was proper because, pursuant to Idaho R. Civ. P. 84, a petition for judicial review would only lie if permitted by statute. There existed no statute or constitutional authority under Idaho law allowing a Board of County Commissions to review the personnel decision of other elected county officers. The appeal on this issue was frivolous. The employee's request for declaratory judgment in the third case was misplaced. Finally, summary judgment for the county was proper in its suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the district court's decisions to deny the employee's petition for judicial review and motion to remand. Attorney fees were awarded to the county in the third case. The supreme court affirmed the district court's decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the county, and it awarded attorney fees incurred on appeal to the county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission for reapportionment adopted the plan at issue after other plans failed. Under the plan, the total maximum population deviation was 9.71 % and the court held that the plan was presumptively constitutional. The court found that petitioners had not demonstrated that regional deviation created constitutional problems for the plan. Under the plan the number of districts in any region corresponded closely to the number of people therein. The numerical discrepancies between districts in the &quot;northern&quot; region and the rest of the state did not show that the regional deviation was significant enough to effectively dilute the right to vote for non-northern voters, and there was no evidence showing that the commission intentionally favored one region to the detriment of another. As to splitting a county, the record showed that if that county were not split, another county would have to be split so that the other county did not have all its districts wholly contained within it. The court found that Idaho Code &sect; 72-1506 qualified as the statute referenced in Idaho Const. art.  III, &sect; 5. Furthermore, petitioners did not explain how 78 precinct splits affected their right to vote.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Fifth Judicial District for the County of Cassia, Idaho, granted judgment in favor of respondents, a county, highway districts, and a driver, on appellant worker's claim after he was run over by a dump truck. The district court found that the respondents were the worker's so-called statutory employers and immune from suit. The worker appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction to determine whether the respondents were his statutory employers. The appellate court noted that the legislature granted a common law right of action in an injured worker against a third party, under Idaho Code &sect; 72-223(2). Since status as a statutory employer was a defense to a common law negligence action, deciding whether a defendant was a third party or statutory employer necessarily attended the district court's task in ruling on matters in such suits. The respondents were an &quot;employer&quot; within the meaning of that term as found in Idaho Code &sect; 72-223(1) and Idaho Code &sect; 72-216. A rational basis existed for the grant of immunity in Idaho Code &sect; 72-223, even if the statutory employer did not have to pay benefits because the direct employer had. While the worker's due process issue was raised and argued, it was not supported with any real authority. The vagueness and uncertainty arguments were belied by the plain language of the statute, which clearly stated who was not a third party. Idaho Code &sect; 54-1218 was not irreconcilable with Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 72-223 and 72-216. None of the parties were entitled to attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that attorney fees incurred by the subcontractor after it had been paid in full were not incurred in an action under the performance bond; therefore, the trial court correctly found that the subcontractor was not entitled to attorney fees under Idaho Code &sect; 54-1929 for successfully defending against the contractor's counterclaim for breach of contract.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents and plaintiff school districts sought declaratory relief against defendant state in an action challenging the adequacy and method of funding public education in Idaho. The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Ada County , issued findings of fact and conclusions of law that the current state system was inadequate and unconstitutional pursuant to Idaho Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In complex litigation involving multiple parties, the district court determined that the state failed in its constitutional duty to provide a thorough education for Idaho's public school students in a safe environment conducive to learning, especially as it pertained to the poorest of school districts. When the legislature, in the district court's opinion, had failed to take appropriate action, the district court began implementing its remedial measures. The district court did not commit any error in making some generalized findings about facility problems, after pointing out some specific and illustrative examples. The supreme court noted that the district court used its discretion in admitting certain affidavits. The supreme court commended the legislature for taking steps towards providing a safe environment; however, that legislation did not make this case moot. Under the public interest exception, an otherwise moot issue could be heard if it was one of substantial public interest. The state next charged the district court erred in ordering the state to pay lead testing expenses. The district court did err in this regard. There was no statute authorizing this award.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that there was nothing to suggest that defendants were not holding containers, or that they were anything than alcohol containers, or that the liquid inside was anything other than alcohol. There was no showing to support an inference that the destroyed evidence would have been exculpatory. There was no showing of bad faith in the destruction of the cans, bottles or their contents. The State had a legitimate interest in the prevention of underage drinking. Suspension of a driver's license was a form of deterrence. The fact that the suspension was applicable to persons between eighteen and twenty-one did not render it unconstitutional. They were still subject to restrictions on drinking and were subject to the same sanctions for punishment and deterrence.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that the United States Supreme Court held that Ring announced a new procedural rule that did not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review. Ring had no applicability to defendant's case. Although defendant argued that the Idaho Supreme Court should follow the lead of the Indiana Supreme Court, the supreme court noted that it had confidence in the ability of district judges to carefully and fairly weigh the facts relating to the imposition of the death penalty. The prior process was not unfair or suspect and the supreme court would not set aside the properly imposed sentence of death in defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that taxpayers who had a generalized grievance shared by a large class of citizens did not have standing. In such case, a taxpayer's remedy was through the political process. Thus, the supreme court held the citizen lacked standing to challenge the tax. The supreme court also rejected the citizen's argument that the bill creating the additional revenue arose in the Idaho Senate, and therefore violated Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 14. To the contrary, the House introduced the sales and use tax bill. Further, art. III, &sect; 14 did not prohibit the Senate from denying passage of a revenue bill, and it did not specifically prohibit the Senate from amending a revenue bill. In sum, the Senate made amendments and the House approved. Thus, the sales and use tax was constitutionally enacted. Finally, the citizen failed to provide any authority to support his claim the district court erred in imposing sanctions against him, thereby waiving that issue on appeal, and the supreme court found that although the law was well settled that the Senate could amend a revenue bill, the appeal was not frivolous, so as to have justified an award of attorney fees for the State.</SPAN></P>

The evidence showed that the ground water was collected in drains and commingled with other diffuse sources such as rain. If the district was relying on an unappropriated source for the expansion, it did not qualify for amnesty under &sect; 42-1426.  Even if the water was treated as ground water, &sect; 42-1426(2) required subordination to those priority rights established before April 12, 1994. Next, the court held that the district did not qualify for the rebuttable presumption established by Idaho Code &sect; 42-1416 (repealed) because the enlargement would have caused a per se injury to the rights of junior appropriators. The ground water users did not waive their right to object because they filed a recommendation instead of an objection. Finally, attorney fees were not warranted as a sanction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was affirmed. Costs were awarded, but no attorney fees were allowed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The factory contracted with the decedent's employer to haul wastewater from its facility. The farm entered into a written agreement with the factory to permit it to build a wastewater facility and to truck wastewater onto its farm site for dispersal. The decedent was killed while waiting to dump a load of wastewater at the farm site. While the trial court erred in finding that the farm, as a mere landowner, was the decedent's statutory employer, its grant of summary judgment was affirmed by the court on the alternate basis that the survivors failed to create a material issue of fact for trial that the farm breached any applicable duty of care, or how that breach proximately caused injury. The work being done was the work of hauling wastewater. Nothing indicated that the farm was engaged in the business of hauling water for pecuniary gain. Thus, the farm was not a statutory employer. Summary judgment was proper as to the factory because it qualified as the decedent's statutory employer under Idaho Code &sect; 72-223 due to its contractual relationship with the decedent's employer. Thus, the factory was immune from third-party tort liability under the Idaho Worker's Compensation Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both cases stemmed from plaintiffs paying liquor license transfer fees to the city. The district court held that 17 members was not a sufficient number to be considered numerous for class action purposes under Idaho R. Civ. P. 23(a), (b). The court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in that holding. The court held that the city's exaction of a liquor license transfer fee could constitute the taking of property without just compensation where the city had no authority to charge a transfer fee. Further, the court's decision in a previous case holding that the city's ordinance imposing a liquor license transfer fee was invalid applied retroactively to the current case. The court also held that because the entertainment companies' notice of claim did not include the name and address of the entertainment companies, their claims under state law were barred, but that the notice of claim requirements of Idaho Code &sect; 50-219 did not apply to their federal claims. Also, because the sum owing was a transfer fee and not a tax, the district court erred in holding that the entertainment companies were required to have paid the fee under protest in order to bring the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the First Judicial District, Bonner County, Idaho, dismissed appellant workers' suit against appellees, Idaho Industrial Commission (commission) and the Idaho Special Indemnity Fund (ISIF), alleging bias, prejudgment, and due process violations in the adjudication of their claims. The workers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the action. The appellate court found, however, that it was not an action between workers and employers. In addition to naming the ISIF, the workers brought suit against the commission itself. An action by a worker against an entity besides a surety or an employer did not generally fall within the purview of the commission. The appellate court treated the dismissal as coming under Idaho R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). In order to avoid dismissal, the workers had to assert an exception to the exhaustion requirement that applied. The workers advanced factual assertions by which the appellate court could infer bias or prejudgment. However, the workers' specific facts did not rise to the level necessary to infer bias or prejudgment on the part of the commission. Without some preliminary inquiry into the merits of the claim, the commission could not properly judge whether an injured worker was surrendering a strong claim for too small a settlement, or whether the ISIF was satisfying spurious claims at great cost. The issues raised by the workers were not frivolous, and therefore no award of attorney fees was warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to the district court's judgment that it did not have jurisdiction to decide claims such as those brought by the workers; the judgment was affirmed as to the dismissal of the action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

Neither party disputed the fact that the patient lived in the county for at least 30 days prior to being treated at the center and he was engaged in seasonal labor and intended to leave Idaho after the 2002 farm season. The county correctly determined that he was not a resident for the purposes of the medical indigency statutes. The statute did not violate equal protection where the payment of medical indigency benefits only to persons who were physically present in Idaho for at least 30 days and intended to remain or did not intend to move elsewhere was rationally related to the legitimate state interest of allocating limited funds. The appellate court declined to award attorney fees to either party.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, State of Idaho that imposed concurrent unified prison sentences of 30 years, with 10 years fixed, on two counts of lewd conduct with a minor under 16 years of age against separate victims, and that denied defendant's request for probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Idaho's sentencing scheme was unconstitutional because it violated his right to a jury trial pursuant to Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), which required that any fact, other than a prior conviction, that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant also claimed that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing concurrent sentences of 30 years with 10 years fixed. The court held that Idaho's sentencing scheme was unaffected by the holding in Blakely because it was an indeterminate sentencing system in which a defendant was given a sentence with a minimum and a maximum. The court noted that there was nothing in Idaho Code &sect; 19-2521 that extended the maximum penalty for defendant's crime. The court also found that defendant failed to show his constitutional rights were violated because the jury and not a judge found him guilty of the two counts of lewd conduct and found him to be a multiple offender. Also imprisonment was appropriate for a multiple offender under &sect; 19-2521(f). The court held that the imposed sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment that sentenced defendant to imprisonment and denied his request for probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties, who were cohabiting, participated in a wedding ceremony officiated by an acquaintance, who allegedly represented to them that he was a minister.

Defendant filed an answer that denied the existence of the alleged marriage. Defendant moved for summary judgment on the ground that the parties did not have a valid marriage. The trial court upheld a magistrate's decision to grant the motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that the Idaho Legislature clearly required a license in order to have a valid marriage. Both the issuance of a license and solemnization were required. Because the parties chose not to obtain a marriage license, their purported marriage violated the provisions of Idaho Code &sect; 32-201(1) (1996). Because they were never married, plaintiff's divorce action was correctly dismissed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Second Judicial District of the State of Idaho, in and for Lewis County, granted defendant post-conviction relief based upon the retroactive application of a United States Supreme Court decision. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court reasoned that first-degree murder was a lesser-included offense of capital first-degree murder and that because defendant had been tried and found guilty of by a jury of first-degree murder, he could only be resentenced for that offense. Defendant asked that the appellate court apply a more lenient standard of retroactivity. However, the appellate court noted that the retroactivity of the decision was a matter of federal law, not state law. Defendant had no right under either the Idaho or Federal Constitutions to have the jury find the existence of an aggravating circumstance. Because there was no error, habeas corpus did not provide a remedy. Idaho Code &sect; 19-2515 did not define a separate crime of capital first-degree murder. It merely set forth the procedures that had to be followed in order to impose a death sentence. The United States Supreme Court's decision in Ring did not elevate those statutory aggravating circumstances into elements of a crime, nor did it create a new crime. Because Ring simply established a new procedural rule for the imposition of the death penalty that was not retroactive, Ring had no application to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners possessed a parcel of land consisting of approximately 175 acres located in the agricultural suburban zone of Kootenai County, Idaho. A planning director with the Kootenai County Planning Department sent the landowners a letter informing them that their private airstrip was prohibited. According to Kootenai County, Idaho, Zoning Ordinance No. 271, the use of a private noncommercial airfield was neither a permitted nor conditional use of the property. In their complaint for declaratory relief, the landowners sought a determination of whether or not their private landing field and hangar were permissible or impermissible use under the Kootenai County Ordinance. The landowners' failure to exhaust their administrative remedies deprived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction over their claim for declaratory relief. The landowners had the following options for seeking redress of the planning director's interpretation of the ordinance: apply for a text amendment to the ordinance, or zone change and conditional use permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the district court to dismiss the claim for declaratory relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State of Idaho appealed a decision of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, which found House Bill 403 of the 2003 Idaho legislative session (HB 403) unconstitutional. Plaintiffs, a group of school districts and parents, brought suit against the State, alleging violations of Idaho Const. art. IX, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group filed the action over 10 years ago, alleging that the public school funding system failed to provide necessary funding, and the legislature enacted HB 403 in an effort to resolve the lawsuit. The legislation established that the group and the State sue individual school districts and the venues would be changed to the judicial districts of the school district. The court held that the group had standing, as the State did not have power legislatively to remove the group as a party by revoking its standing. The court held that the language of the bill was aimed at essentially disbanding the group's case and restructuring it in a manner that destroyed the group's cause of action, and it was clearly a special law, in violation of Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 9. Further, Idaho Code &sect; 6-2215(3), as amended by HB 403, directly contradicted Idaho court procedure and effectively dismissed parties to a pending lawsuit without any court action, and, because Idaho Code. &sect; 6-2214, as amended by HB 403, assigned the power to tax to the judiciary, it violated the Idaho Constitution. Therefore, that part of HB 403 that amended Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 6-2215(3) and 6-2214 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff individuals asserted claims of nuisance and trespass against defendant seed growers. After the enactment of Idaho Code &sect; 22-4801 et seq., the individuals requested that the district court declare the statute unconstitutional. The District Court of the First Judicial District, State of Idaho, Kootenai County, held that the statute was unconstitutional. The seed growers moved for permissive appeal, and the motion was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue on appeal was whether the district court erred in finding HB 391, 2003 Leg. (Idaho 2003), Idaho Code &sect; 22-4801 et seq. (amended 2003), was an unconstitutional taking; whether the legislation was an unconstitutional limitation that was not in the interests of the common welfare; and whether the district court erred in finding that HB 391 was a local or special law. The taking asserted was in the nature of a regulatory taking, but the landowners did not claim a permanent deprivation of all economically beneficial uses of their land. The provision of Idaho Code &sect; 22-4806A(6) granting immunity to the grass farmers did not represent an unconstitutional taking. Because there clearly were some interests of the common welfare being protected by the legislature's action in allowing field burning, the supreme court could not say that the landowners met their burden to show no conceivable constitutional application for this legislation. Despite some particularized references to the 10 northern counties, including the imposition of stricter requirements on North Idaho counties, the statute applied to all counties. The statute was not a local and a special law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the district court's conclusion.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that the landowners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, as the County hearing examiner was designated as the decision maker for appeals concerning issues of interpretation. The landowners failed to demonstrate that justice required relaxation of the exhaustion rule or that the County acted outside its authority. Thus, the general rule of exhaustion of administrative remedies applied. As the landowners' complaint sought declaratory relief from the planning director's interpretation of the zoning ordinance, this issue should have been pursued before the county zoning authorities under the procedures of the county's administrative appeal ordinance and not by the trial court through declaratory relief. Thus, the landowners' failure to exhaust their administrative remedies deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over their claim for declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a 10-year-old elementary student.

However, the supreme court concluded that the language of &sect; 33-512(11) evidenced a legislative purpose of protecting, not prosecuting, pupils. Idaho Code &sect; 33-512(6) already granted the board of trustees of each school district specific powers and duties to prescribe rules for the disciplining of unruly or insubordinate pupils. The supreme court held that an interpretation of Idaho Code &sect; 33-512(11) that criminalized student misconduct was not necessary to carry out its purpose or to avoid rendering the statute a nullity.

The District Court of the First Judicial District (Idaho) denied defendant's motion to dismiss on First Amendment grounds, in which he alleged that the statutes were overbroad.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect;&sect; 18-1507A &amp; 18-1507, specifically, the definition of &quot;erotic nudity&quot; in &sect; 18-1507(2)(e), were unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment because they criminalized an intolerable range of constitutionally protected conduct by seeking to prohibit possession based upon the thoughts of the possessor. The Supreme Court of Idaho held that &sect; 18-1507(2)(e) was not unconstitutionally overbroad, because it withstood analysis under Ferber and Osborne. First, it limited its reach to works that visually depicted sexual conduct by children below a certain age. The statute limited its scope in &sect; 18-1507(2)(b) &amp; (c) to &quot;sexually exploitative material&quot; such as photographs or videotapes depicting a child under the age of 18. Second, it suitably limited the category of &quot;sexual conduct&quot; proscribed. By limiting the prohibition of such &quot;displays&quot; to material made &quot;for the purpose of overt sexual gratification or stimulation of one or more of the persons involved,&quot; the statute simultaneously targeted child pornography, which was not protected speech, and reduced the possibility that the statute would be used to prohibit protected speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The director argued that the corporation had operated a collection agency, in Idaho in violation of the Idaho Collection Agency Act (Act), Idaho Code &sect; 26-2221 (2000), and thus properly issued the cease and desist order. The appellate court found that Idaho had personal jurisdiction over the corporation, which failed to meet its burden of proving unconstitutional selective enforcement to establish impermissible activity by a state agency. No substantial rights were prejudiced by the director's decision. The rental vehicle damage claim, which the corporation collected against the Idaho resident, constituted a claim or other indebtedness within the meaning of Idaho Code &sect; 26-2223(2). According to the corporation's agreement, monies collected were to be placed in a trust account, from which the corporation disbursed the appropriate sums to the car rental agency after retaining a percentage of monies collected. The assignment created between the corporation and the agency was for the purpose of collection. The corporation collected on the agency's behalf, in violation of the Act. Because the case was of first impression, the director's request for attorney fees was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The director's cease and desist order was affirmed and reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the parent was fired from her position with the charter school in which her child was enrolled, the parent began writing letters criticizing the charter school's special education program. The charter school responded by filing its lawsuit. The trial court held that because the charter school was a governmental entity, it could not maintain an action for libel and slander against an individual. The trial court further held that the charter school failed to provide any Idaho statute or case law supporting a cause of action in tort for interference with an entity's responsibilities under state statutes. The appellate court noted that because a governmental entity could not maintain a libel and slander claim against a person whose speech was protected, dismissal of the libel and slander claim was appropriate because an injunction on speech critical of a public official was an impermissible prior restraint. The appellate court held that a charter school's claim that a parent tortiously interfered with its responsibilities under the Idaho Public Charter Schools Act was a non-existent cause of action and unsupported by the common law, Idaho statutes, or Idaho case law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician did not challenge the Board's authority to permanently restrict his license. The physician contended that he was denied due process by the Board's failure to promulgate regulations setting forth clearly defined standards with respect to the use of injectable hormones. The Supreme Court of Idaho held that one of the purposes of the Medical Practice Act, Idaho Code &sect; 54-1814, was to assure the public health, safety and welfare, and consistent with that purpose the Board could discipline the physician for providing health care that failed to meet the applicable standard of care even if it could not prove that his patients had suffered any physical harm. The Board found credible the expert physicians it called to testify who appeared to be representative of the community. The Board's findings as to the standard of care were supported by substantial evidence and were not clearly erroneous. The hearing officer issued a protective order, pursuant to the parties' stipulation, preventing the physician from harassing the expert witnesses who were going to testify. But the Board had no contempt power and thus, had no authority to fine the physician for violating the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Idaho Code &sect; 18-6409 was unconstitutionally vague because it encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement due to its lack of standards defining when someone's peace was disturbed or what words were vulgar, profane, or indecent. The Supreme Court of Idaho held that the third part of Idaho Code &sect; 18-6409 was unconstitutional, because, as written, it criminalized speech that was protected by the First Amendment. Therefore, the court struck that part of the statute to eliminate overbreadth so that it conformed to the opinions of the United States Supreme Court interpreting the First Amendment. However, the court would not reverse defendant's conviction based solely upon his challenge that the statute was facially overbroad. Because defendant did not allege that the statute was unconstitutionally applied to his conduct or that he did not have fair notice that his conduct was proscribed, and because he did not show any error by the trial court, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners applied to the county for a variance from the setback requirements after they had begun construction of a boathouse.

The trial court vacated the issuance of the variance and remanded the matter to the board. On remand, the board denied the variance. The trial court awarded the neighbors attorney fees and costs against the county. On appeal, the court found that, based on a board member's ex parte contacts and prehearing statements concerning the boathouse, the trial court properly determined that the neighbors' due process rights were violated. The board member's comments not only created an appearance of impropriety, but also underscored the likelihood that he could not fairly decide the issue in the case. The court further found that the filing of the neighbors' memorandum of costs was not in compliance with Idaho App. R. 40(c), as it was not filed within 14 days from the filing and announcement of the opinion on appeal. As a matter of law, the untimely memorandum barred consideration of the neighbors' request for attorney fees and costs.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the district court excluded from the sales factor denominator the taxpayer's sales of accounts receivable. The district court then granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Commission. In affirming, the court determined that the law of the case doctrine applied. Therefore, the court was bound by the finding that the inclusion of accounts receivable owing from freight sales and money received from the sale of those accounts receivable resulted in an improper apportionment. The double-counting of income was an &quot;unusual fact situation&quot; that justified avoidance of the apportionment set forth in &sect; 63-3027. Further, the district court considered all three relevant factors when it determined whether the standard apportionment fairly represented the taxpayer's income.

On review, the Court of Appeals overruled its decision in Sabin and vacated the dismissal order. The State petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court ordered a hearing on the inmate's post-conviction claim of deficiency of counsel, but gave notice of its intent to dismiss all other claims. The inmate failed to timely respond to the notice pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 19-4906(b). The district court denied the inmate's claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and dismissed remaining claims. On review, the Court of Appeals overruled its decision in Sabin v. State, 129 Idaho 257, 923 P.2d 502 (Ct. App. 1996), which held applicants for post-conviction relief who failed to respond to a notice of intent to dismiss waived appellate review. The Supreme Court of Idaho upheld the decision of the Court of Appeals. As for the merits of the inmate's post-conviction claim, the Court held that he waived his right to a presentence investigation report, but that he did not waive the right to make corrections to the psychosexual and social assessment reports. The notice of intent to dismiss the inmate's claim was inadequate, because it did not give the rationale for dismissing the claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, which could include a notice from the district court of the bases for an intent to dismiss all or part of the application. Dismissal of the inmate's post-conviction claim relating to the lack of a PSI was affirmed. Dismissal on all grounds was vacated.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder and first-degree kidnapping. Defendant was sentenced to death and appealed. Defendant filed a post-conviction application to proceed pro se, which the court summarily dismissed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, defendant asserted that he was denied the right to the effective assistance of counsel because of a conflict of interest that the lower courts were aware of, but into which they failed to make adequate inquiry to protect defendant's due process rights. The Supreme Court of Idaho held that defendant had not been denied the right to effective assistance of counsel, and the exercise of his right to waive counsel was found to have been competent. The district court did not err in conducting the competency reviews or in concluding that defendant had voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel. Defendant had not established reversible error in the conduct of the trial, the selection of the jury, or in his contests to the summary dismissal of his postconviction application. However, in compliance with Ring v. Arizona, which rendered unconstitutional a sentencing scheme of that required a trial judge to make the factual findings regarding the existence of aggravating circumstances, defendant had to be resentenced under the newly enacted death penalty statute,&nbsp;Idaho Code &sect; 19-2515, which presented neither a double jeopardy nor an ex post facto problem.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a decision of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, State of Idaho, Ada County, which affirmed a magistrate's dismissal of trespass charges under Idaho Code &sect; 18-7008(8) against defendant and concluded that the statute was void for vagueness and overbroad. Defendant cross-appealed and claimed that the trial court erred in finding that defendant was not protected under double jeopardy grounds against a retrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appeared at the state health and welfare department to discuss his child support obligations. When defendant refused to leave after being asked to do so, he was arrested for trespassing. The magistrate dismissed the charge and found that the statute was void for vagueness. Alternatively, the magistrate granted defendant's motion for acquittal under Idaho Crim. R. 29 on the ground that the official who requested defendant to leave did not express an adequate reason for doing so. The trial court agreed that the statute was void for vagueness and further found it to be overbroad. The court reversed on appeal. Because Idaho Code &sect; 18-7008(8) informed the public of the prohibited conduct, the statute gave fair notice of the conduct that was made criminal by the statute, and thus the statute was not void for vagueness. Because the statute did not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, the statute was not overbroad. Because the magistrate's dismissal was based on an erroneous legal conclusion, that the official failed to give defendant a reason why he had to leave, double jeopardy did not bar a retrial on the trespass charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conclusion that the trespass statute was void for vagueness and overbroad.

Appellant contractor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor was a licensed public works contractor engaged in collecting solid waste. The contractor sought a declaratory judgment that Idaho Code &sect; 31-4401(2) did not permit the county to charge a user fee to county residents who did not use the county solid waste disposal facilities. The appellate court determined that the trial court erred in holding that the statute permitted the county to charge fees to the nonusers of the county facilities where the contractor had its own disposal facilities. The appellate court held the county could only charge the contractor or its customers fees if they attempted to deliver waste to a county facility. However, the appellate court found there was not a violation of the Commerce Clause because the county ordinance did not prohibit importing solid waste collected outside the state or higher fees charged to process waste generated outside the state. The appellate court concluded the disposal fees did not violate the Commerce Clause because they subsidized the county transfer station, thereby making out-of-state disposal facilities less able to compete with the county facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed insofar as the county did not violate the Commerce Clause; however, the portion of the judgment holding that the statute authorized a county to charge a users fee to nonusers of the county solid waste disposal facilities was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rancher and the United States filed de minimis stock water rights claims to the same basin area. A state investigator prepared a director's report listing all existing water rights claims. The rancher received notice that the report was available for his inspection, but was not informed of any actual conflict to his water claims. Later, the Snake River Basin Adjudication (SRBA) granted the United States its beneficial use claims and reserved water rights claims. The rancher then unsuccessfully sought relief from the judgment on the basis of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The appellate court held there was no doubt that the rancher was aware of the commencement of the SRBA and that action concerning its claimed rights and the rights of others in the region would be adjudicated. The appellate court concluded the rancher was able to recognize the conflicts and get notice of the objections to its water claims once it actually looked at the director's report, but that he simply looked too late; therefore, his difficulties arose from a lack of timely attention, not inadequacy of notice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that the trial court erred in: (1) refusing to reallocate the burden of proof as requested; (2) holding that Idaho Code &sect; 18-3810 (1997) was not unconstitutionally vague; (3) holding that the corporation's video machines were illegal gambling devices; and (4) refusing to rule on whether the video machines would be illegal gambling devices if they were operated in some other manner. The instant court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to require the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the machines were gambling devices or slot machines. These lawsuits were not criminal proceedings, and the machines that were the subject of the lawsuits were not persons. Section 18-3810 was not unconstitutionally vague. The definition of slot machine was sufficiently definite so that people of common intelligence did not have to guess at what a slot machine was.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sued appellee State Alcohol Beverage Control Board (ABC) in the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County, Idaho, alleging a liquor license transfer fee triggered by the sale of its liquor license was unconstitutional tax. The trial court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the corporation sold its liquor license, it was required to pay a transfer fee equal to 10 percent of the sale price to the state, pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 23-908(5). The corporation paid the transfer fee under protest and filed suit in trial court against the ABC, arguing that the transfer fee was an unconstitutional tax, a taking without just compensation, and an unjust enrichment for the State. The trial court dismissed the case, finding no claim upon which relief could be granted. The appellate court initially noted the transfer fee at issue was not violative of the uniformity and proportionality constitutional requirements for taxes because those provisions did not apply to liquor licensing or transfer fees. The appellate court held the disputed transfer fee fell within a very broad constitutional power of the State to regulate the traffic of liquor. The appellate court concluded deference was given to the State in its use of the police power regarding a transfer fee, and there was no unconstitutional taking of property under either the Idaho or United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon selling its liquor license to a third party, the corporation was required to pay a transfer fee to the city equal to 7 1/2 percent of the sale price, pursuant to Boise, Idaho, City Code &sect; 5-05-10. The corporation argued that the city was not specifically authorized by statute to impose a liquor license transfer fee, the fee was a disguised and unconstitutional tax, the fee was an unconstitutional taking of property, and the fee was an unjust enrichment for the city. The appellate court found that Idaho Code &sect; 23-916 provided cities with authority to impose a license fee, not a transfer fee. The statute could not have been drafted to include transfer fees, as they were non-existent when the statute was passed. Cities were not granted the authority by the legislature to impose a transfer fee. The city exceeded its power in collecting the transfer fee.</SPAN></P>

The citizens also challenged the denial of their motion for leave to file a bond.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A special reserve levy was approved to fund the construction of a new high school. As a result, a lease-purchase agreement was entered into with the bank. The citizens filed a declaratory action seeking the invalidation of the levy. After the citizens failed to file a bond, their action was dismissed. The district court determined that the citizens were required to file the complaint and a bond within 40 days of the contested election. The citizens' motion for leave to file a bond was denied. In reversing, the court determined that two counts of the citizens' action challenged the validity of the lease-purchase agreement between the bank and the school district. It did not challenge the election itself. Therefore, the lack of a cost bond was irrelevant to those counts. The third count of the complaint did challenge the election. However, under Idaho Code &sect; 34-2001A(B), the citizens were permitted to post a bond in a school district election contest at any time after a clerk of court or district judge determined the amount of the bond. Bond filing was not jurisdictional in the sense that the case was subject to dismissal merely for failing to file the bond.</SPAN></P>

The county filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking to have the action dismissed on the ground that it was immune from liability under Idaho Code &sect; 46-1017. The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Boise County, granted the county's motion. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor issued a proclamation declaring a disaster emergency as a result of severe winter storms creating excessive snowfall and ice conditions throughout the county. The county and the owner entered into an agreement to use the owner's dump truck to haul debris from the flooding and mudslides. When the county road superintendent heard that the owner also had a front-end loader, he used it to clear debris. The owner was not present, had not known that his loader was going to be used by the county, and did not consent to that use. The loader was destroyed by a mudslide. The district court held that the county was immune from liability, pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 46-1017, which was part of the Idaho Disaster Preparedness Act of 1975, Idaho Code &sect; 46-1001 et seq. (1997). The Supreme Court of Idaho held that &sect; 46-1012(3) was clear and unambiguous. Compensation for property damaged, lost, or destroyed could be recovered under the Act only if its use or destruction was ordered by the governor or his representative.  Idaho Code &sect; 46-1017 did not limit the scope of immunity to damages compensable under &sect; 46-1012. Therefore, the district court had not erred in dismissing the claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was affirmed. Costs, but not attorney fees, were awarded on appeal to the county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding, petitioner opponents asserted that an Indian gaming initiative, Idaho Proposition 1, violated the Idaho Constitution's prohibition against gambling, violated notions of equal protection, and extinguished existing debts. The opponents sought an order and or writ prohibiting respondent Idaho Secretary of State from placing the initiative on the November 2002 ballot. Respondents moved to dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The opponents alleged that they would suffer injury because the gambling authorized by the initiative, if adopted, would require additional funding of social services and law enforcement. The instant court noted that the opponents had not alleged an injury in fact. Any injury suffered was speculative. It was not possible to determine the accuracy of the alleged future injuries. Under traditional standards for determining standing, the opponents did not have standing. There was not yet a real controversy because the initiative was simply a proposal and had not become a law. There was no need for adjudication. The case did not meet the elements of the traditional ripeness test. The instant court concluded that there was no justiciable controversy. There was no challenge to the process by which the initiative had been qualified to be on the ballot or that the subject matter was beyond the reach of an initiative. If the initiative passed, there would most certainly be a justiciable controversy. If the initiative failed, there would be nothing to adjudicate. The instant court could not be compelled to decide a case that lacked a justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children's mother executed a will designating the guardians in the event of her death. The magistrate court denied the guardians' request for automatic appointment and held that they had not fulfilled the required qualifications for appointment since they had not alleged that the father of the children was unknown or dead. The supreme court ruled that the guardians failed to establish the conditions of Idaho Code &sect; 15-5-202, in that they failed to demonstrate that the father of the children was dead or had been adjudged incapacitated. The argument that a person was incapacitated simply by being unknown was not supported by the probate code. Furthermore, Idaho Code &sect; 15-5-202 was not unconstitutional. The statute allowed a parent to appoint a testamentary guardian, but placed procedural safeguards to protect the rights of a surviving parent, who would also had the right to control the care and upbringing of his or her children.</SPAN></P>

The inmate, who had previously filed a petition for postconviction relief, raised five claims in his second petition for postconviction relief. The first three claims involved ineffective assistance of counsel, the fourth related to the constitutionality of the statutory scheme for capital postconviction proceedings, and the fifth challenged the constitutionality of the length of the inmate's confinement. The only issue before the instant court was whether it should dismiss the inmate's appeal based upon the provisions of &sect; 19-2719. The instant court held that the inmate failed to raise the claims in his successive petition within the time specified in &sect; 19-2719 because he had made no showing the claims were not known and could not reasonably have been known at the time he filed his first petition. Therefore, the inmate waived his claims pursuant to the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1994, the Term Limit Act was passed by the Idaho voters. Subsequently, the Idaho legislature passed legislation that repealed the Term Limits Act. In the body of the law, the legislature declared that an emergency existed so that the repeal would become effective on February 1, 2002, rather than July 1, 2002. The court held that the case was ripe and appropriate for judicial review, as it impacted the primary election that was coming up shortly, and a decision by the court would allow the electoral process to proceed with certainty. The citizens had standing to bring the case, as one of the citizens was running against an opponent who would be ineligible for office, if the repeal of the Term Limits Act was unconstitutional. While the legislature could not violate the right of the people to propose laws and enact them at the polls, it had the legislative right to repeal an initiative, which once enacted, was treated as other ordinary legislative measures. The court also held that the legislature's determination of an emergency in an act was a policy decision exclusively within the ambit of legislative authority, and the judiciary could not second-guess that decision.</SPAN></P>

The plan contained a population deviation of 11.79 percent, well above a prima facie showing of a violation of equal protection standards. The commission justified that deviation on the basis that it occurred as the result of an advancement of rational state policies, particularly maintenance of the integrity of political subdivisions. Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 5 prohibited the division of counties, except to meet the constitutional standards of equal protection. The prohibition was honored by the commission with respect to Madison and Fremont counties, but was not honored as to Bingham and Bannock counties. In those instances, the idea of joining communities of interest prevailed over the requirement of maintaining county integrity. The basis for justifying the population deviation in the plan was not consistent with other decisions made by the commission that did not honor the integrity of political subdivisions. Therefore, the commission was directed to reconvene to adopt a redistricting plan that was consistent with constitutional standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subcontractor had an account with the supplier with an outstanding balance before he began the project.

The Supreme Court of Idaho held that there was substantial and competent evidence to support the district court's findings regarding which materials were provided by the supplier to the project. Therefore, they were properly included in the lien amount. Although the district court concluded that the subcontractor's testimony was unreliable, the district court had testimony from the contractor he had hired, who did most of the work on the project, and the correlation between the invoices submitted by the supplier, the bills submitted from the subcontractor to the general contractor, and the payments made by the general contractor to support the decision.

The statutes did not distinguish based upon classifications, but rather applied equally to all candidates based on the number of years served. Considering the rational basis standard, the statutes did not violate the candidates' right of equal protection guaranteed by the Idaho Constitution. The statutes were rationally related by limiting access to the ballot by certain incumbents to the legitimate government goal of giving more individuals the opportunity to hold government offices than would be possible without the benefit of the ballot access restrictions.

As State failed to show that the population disparity resulted from advancement of a rational policy, the court ruled that the presumption of discrimination applied, and L66 was unconstitutional in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

The instant court held that the three-year span from the date of defendant's first appellate brief to the assertion of his current claims was an unreasonable length of time for the pursuit of postconviction relief because the issues raised or not raised by appellate counsel were known at the time of the filing of the first appellate brief.

The court found that since the defendant did not possess a constitutionally protected liberty interest, the district court did not violate the defendant's due process rights by relinquishing jurisdiction without holding a hearing on the accuracy of prison's report. The court also found that the district court properly concluded that the defendant was not a good candidate for probation and that a reduction in sentence was appropriate. The trial court noted that the defendant was likely to relapse into substance abuse, had emotional and anger management problems, and an immaturity problem, in making its decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state tax commission assessed income tax deficiencies against the taxpayer. At issue was the taxpayer's apportionment of income to Idaho. Corporations such as the taxpayer operating both in Idaho and in one or more other states were required to apportion some business income to Idaho. The apportionment took into account three factors called the &quot;property factor,&quot; the &quot;payroll factor,&quot; and the &quot;sales factor.&quot; The taxpayer included as part of the sales factor the sales of its account receivables. The state tax commission conceded that item constituted a sale. The trial court thus ruled against the state tax commission. Also, the trial court concluded dividends the taxpayer received from mining soda ash were not &quot;business income&quot; under Idaho Code &sect; 63-3027(a)(1) because they were not received in the regular course of business. After summary judgment was entered for the taxpayer, the appellate court found that including the sale of accounts receivable in the sales factor did not fairly show how the taxpayer earned its income. It also found that the trial court only considered one of two definitions of &quot;business income&quot; and should have considered the other one as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment for taxpayer on the issue of whether including in the income apportionment formula money received from the sale of accounts receivable fairly represented how the taxpayer earned its income was vacated. Judgment that income the taxpayer received from stock dividends was not business income also had to be vacated.</SPAN></P>

According to defendant, the jury was unable to distinguish a felony from a misdemeanor because of the statute's broad definition of &quot;traumatic injury.&quot; This confusion, defendant claimed, forced defendants to prove the absence of a &quot;traumatic injury&quot; in order for a jury to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor. Defendant contended that the lack of a distinction between a misdemeanor and a felony rendered the statute unconstitutional. Defendant also argued that the jury instructions unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to him. The instant court held that the domestic violence statute's definition of &quot;traumatic injury&quot; was sufficiently defined and was not unconstitutionally vague. The jury instructions did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proving an essential element of the statute from the State to defendant.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court of Idaho held that: (1) the U.S. Supreme Court had not established an absolute constitutional privilege to publish information in a public file, and distinguished the present case from one relied on by the publisher; and (2) the privilege did not extend to cloak the press in an absolute privilege to publish a statement regarding the plaintiff's sexuality found in a forty-year-old court file where the statement was not used in an official or judicial proceeding, was never entered into evidence, and was not in a court pleading.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court affirmed, finding that there were circumstances which would allow a defendant to be convicted of the lesser crime of misdemeanor domestic battery, and the legislature had clearly expressed its intent of creating a crime and punishment for those who willfully caused traumatic injuries to other members of a household.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant union sought declaratory relief and an injunction precluding respondent city from implementing a subcontract collective bargaining agent. The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, State of Idaho, Ada County, denied appellant's request, and this appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant firefighters' union claimed Idaho's civil service statutes prohibited the subcontracting of work to non-civil service employees. Had the agreements resulted in termination or demotion of existing civil service employees, respondent's action would have been in conflict with the Civil Service Act. However, none of the union-members lost their jobs. The collective labor agreement (CLA) made arbitration of appellant's grievance compulsory. The issues raised by appellant constituted a grievance under the CLA. It was error for the district court to conclude that the contracts were within the exclusive discretion of respondent. The Collective Bargaining Act, Idaho Code &sect; 44-1801 et seq., required respondent to negotiate its decision to contract out firefighting services. Mandatory negotiations on the subcontracting issue would not have significantly interfered with respondent's management rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part. Respondent's contracts with non-union firefighters did not violate the Idaho Constitution or the Idaho Civil Service Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state treasurer challenged the judgment of the District Court, Fourth Judicial District, Ada County (Idaho), which ruled, inter alia, that the ballot to amend Idaho Const. amend. IX, &sect;&sect; 3, 11 was properly submitted to the voters; that the Idaho School Bond Guaranty Act (Act), Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 33-5301 et seq., 63-3638(6), and 57-728, was constitutional; and ordered appellant to perform the duties of his office as required by the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the appellant contended that the single ballot to amend Idaho Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 3, 11 was illegal because the sections were unrelated and independent of one another; therefore a single ballot should not have been used. Appellant also argued that the Act was unconstitutional because the purchase of notes under the Act was a transfer of endowment funds not authorized by Idaho Const. art. IX, &sect; 3. The court held that the Act was constitutional and immediately subject to implementation by the appellant. The court held that the single ballot was properly submitted to the voters. The two amendments were related and although not dependent one upon the other, they were neither incongruous nor in conflict. The amendments were part of a common scheme to increase the flexibility of the management of the public school endowment fund. The court also held that the purchase of notes was not a transfer, use or appropriation of endowment funds but was the purchase of an investment to be held as an asset of the fund, which in turn will produce income for the fund. Therefore the Act did not violate the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Third Judicial District Court, Canyon County (Idaho), which upheld the constitutionality of a municipal ordinance denying a retail license for the sale of beer or wine to someone, who within the previous five years, had been convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or other intoxicating substances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that respondent city's ordinance which prevented him from having his beer and wine license renewed was unconstitutional because there was no rational relationship between his having been convicted of driving while under the influence and his operating a business involved in the retail sale of beer and wine. The instant court upheld the trial court's ruling that the ordinance was constitutional. Respondent could have reasonably concluded that a retail seller of alcoholic beverages who had himself been recently convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs was less likely to fulfill his obligation of not selling alcoholic beverages to intoxicated customers. For the same reason that the ordinance was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose, the instant court concluded that the ordinance was not unreasonable or arbitrary. The instant court declined to award attorney fees to respondent, as appellant's arguments were not frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.</SPAN></P>

The State requested a continuance to accommodate the complaining witness. The magistrate continued the trial. Defendant moved to dismiss because of the denial of his right to a speedy trial. The magistrate granted the State a later continuance, to which defendant again objected in a motion. The magistrate conducted a hearing and stated that the volume of the caseload made it impossible to afford defendant his right to a trial within the required six-month period under Idaho Code &sect; 19-3501 (2000) and denied defendant's motion to dismiss. Defendant entered a guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the speedy trial issue. The magistrate entered an order withholding judgment and placed defendant on probation. The decision of the magistrate was affirmed by the district court and later by the Court of Appeals. The supreme court found that the magistrate erred by improperly denying defendant's motion to dismiss for violation of his speedy trial rights under Idaho Code &sect; 19-3501(3) as the magistrate granted a continuance beyond the statutory limit without a showing of good cause by the State.</SPAN></P>

The lower court ruled that several provisions of CBECA were unconstitutional. Plaintiffs did not show that CBECA denied them their right to a speedy remedy. CBECA did not impermissibly limit plaintiffs' rights to pursue constitutionally required educational services. Plaintiffs' rights under Idaho Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant, who was a passenger in a car that was pulled over by a police officer, argued that: (1) the search and seizure of a bag found in the car was unconstitutional; (2) there was insufficient evidence presented which would have allowed jury to properly conclude that defendant was guilty of forgery; (3) the prosecutor engaged in multiplicitous charging; (4) defendant's trial attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel; and (5) trial court abused its discretion at sentencing. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence. It was not improper for the officer to search the bag in the course of searching the car with the consents he had obtained from the driver, from the apparent owner, and from defendant. Although some of the documents found in defendant's possession could not have been passed as checks without more work, a rational jury could have determined that defendant intended to continue the process. Defendant was properly charged with 14 counts. The court did not have sufficient evidence to consider defendant's claim of ineffective assistance. The sentences imposed by the trial court were not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that appellant's speech was not constitutionally protected because her speech fell within the &quot;fighting words&quot; exception to free speech and was thereby subject to regulation. Appellant's statement contained no message of social or political importance, and the &quot;fighting words&quot; exception applied even though the girl could not physically have retaliated.

The trial court found that all of these claims were either raised or could have been raised in the initial post-conviction application, and denied the petition. The supreme court affirmed, holding that while the issue of conflict of interest by trial counsel was newly discovered and reviewable, appellant failed to show his representation was adversely affected by any conflict. Further claims of ineffective assistance were rejected as untimely. Finally, appellant did not have a right to appointed counsel on his second petition, and denial of appellant's discovery request did not prevent further investigation by appellant's representatives.</SPAN></P>
