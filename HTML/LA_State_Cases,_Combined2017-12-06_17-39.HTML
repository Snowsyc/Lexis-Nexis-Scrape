</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, of possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance--MDMA,  in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(A). The trial judge found defendant to be a second felony offender and imposed a 30-year sentence without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was attempting to enter a nightclub with 50 or 60 people waiting in line outside to get in and police officers present. Posted signs stated that patrons were subject to search. Defendant triggered a beep as he walked through the metal detector. Defendant created a disturbance as security attempted to frisk him, he was arrested for disturbing the peace, and a search produced a bag of multi-colored pills, a random sample of which tested positive for MDMA. After the jury rendered its verdict, a poll revealed the vote was 11-1 in favor of conviction. Defendant argued that the non-unanimous verdict violated his right to a trial by jury, and that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 782(A) and La. Const., art. 1, &sect; 17(A) were unconstitutional. The court held that under the exception to the general rule pretermitting review, it could consider whether Apprendi v. New Jersey had overruled Louisiana authority validating a non-unanimous jury verdict. The court held that neither Apprendi nor the other cases cited by defendant required a unanimous jury verdict. Rather, they spoke to the issues that must be decided by a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was affirmed. His sentence was vacated and the matter remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, an interstate natural gas pipeline company, appealed a partial summary judgment from the 19th Judicial District Court, in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which, in consolidated property tax refund proceedings, determined that defendant assessors were required to reassess pipeline property and declined to rule on the company's Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, challenge to pipeline valuation rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the company met the definition of a pipeline company in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1851(K), its property was classified as public service property under &sect; 47:1851(M) and was assessed at 25 percent of fair market value pursuant to La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 18(B). Some of its competitors operating in intrastate commerce did not meet the definition of pipeline companies and therefore paid ad valorem taxes at the 15 percent rate applicable to properties that were not public service properties. The district court ruled that the pipeline company was entitled to reassessment at the 15 percent rate but did not address the constitutional issue. The court, after conducting a dormant Commerce Clause analysis, held that the definition of &quot;pipeline company&quot; found in &sect; 47:1851(K) resulted in disparate treatment between interstate and some intrastate pipeline companies and therefore was unconstitutional and in violation of the Commerce Clause. The remaining portions of &sect; 47:1851 were severable and valid, with the exception of the phrase &quot;pipeline company&quot; in &sect; 47:1851(M), which had to be removed. The district court correctly ordered a remand for reassessment of the properties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the district court's determination that ad valorem taxes on all pipeline property had to be calculated at 15 percent of fair market value as determined by the assessors of the parishes within which the properties were located, reversed as to the consideration of the constitutional issue, and rendered judgment declaring &sect; 47:1851(K)&nbsp;unconstitutional and ordering that the phrase &quot;pipeline company&quot; be stricken from &sect; 47:1851(M).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which convicted him of aggravated battery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34 and sentenced him to a period of incarceration at hard labor for eight years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for aggravated battery but the appellate court affirmed. The record contained no motion to quash challenging the assistant district attorney's signature pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 534(1), and defendant's objection at trial to the timing of the arraignment raised a different issue. Accordingly, the issue that the indictment was flawed was not properly preserved for review by the appellate court. Additionally, his argument that the State failed to prove that the offense occurred in Orleans Parish was without merit because he failed to challenge venue in a pretrial motion to quash. His eight-year sentence was not excessive because he faced a sentence of up to 10 years at hard labor and a fine of up to $5,000. The jury did not find defendant credible and the district court also considered the victim's wish that defendant be punished to the full extent of the law. First offenders had received maximum and near maximum sentences and defendant had perjured himself. A lesser sentence would have depreciated the serious nature of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 18th Judicial District Court, in and for the Parish of Iberville, Louisiana, granted judgment in favor of appellee, Parish of Iberville Sales Tax Department, by issuing a permanent injunction against appellant city, enjoining the collection of the tax. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court found that the 2 1/2% maximum tax limit contained in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2711 was available entirely to a municipality without reference to sales and use taxes imposed by other local governmental entities. The 1998 legislative resolutions were not persuasive in the case. The city's 2007 ordinance, St. Gabriel, La., Ordinance 2007-0001-1155 contained no new tax, but merely stated the city's change in policy from abstaining from collecting all of the tax authorized by the 1996 ordinance to a new course of action, i.e., to begin collecting all of the tax authorized by the voters as stated in St. Gabriel, La., Ordinance 1996-10. The city had imposed no new tax, rather, it had begun to collect the whole of the 1996 tax. Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2711, incorporated municipalities were authorized to levy and collect sales and use taxes not in excess of 21/2% upon satisfying the procedural requirements of that statute, without reference to the limitations imposed on parishes and school boards by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2721.6(A)(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents had both relinquished custody of their child to grandparents shortly after the child's birth. The grandparents' action to establish custody under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 133 immediately followed resulting in a consent judgment for their sole custody of the child. Four years later, the father commenced the current action to modify the grandparents' custody and establish his primary custody of the child. The trial court allowed the child's custody to remain in the &quot;excellent&quot; environment of care which the grandparents had continuously provided and the appellate court affirmed. Based upon the provisions for the award of custody to a nonparent under art. 133, the trial court correctly rejected modification of the grandparents' custody. The father produced no evidence demonstrating that the family environment that the grandparents had provided the child immediately after his birth had changed and had become unstable and inadequate to continue to serve the best interests of the child. The strength of the father's rehabilitation, which afforded him liberal visitation, did not establish by itself the requisite proof under art. 133 to modify the prior adjudication of custody.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the parents could not have amended their petition in such a way as to provide the trial court with jurisdiction over the parents' request for mandatory injunctive relief. There was no way the parents could state a cause of action against BESE for the injunctive relief they sought. The statute the parents challenged, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:1990, specifically provided a mechanism to address the situation that the parents complained occurred when students left the Recovery School District (RSD) and returned to the East Baton Rouge Parish (EBRP) school system. The responsibility for making such adjustments was on the DOE. The RSD's use of the school buildings was authorized by La. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3(A) and provided an exception to the general prohibition against the loan of public property. Since La. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 9(A) did not prohibit the creation of the RSD, it was within the plenary power of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority (NORA), brought expropriation proceedings against defendant property owners in the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana). The trial court appointed an attorney to represent a deceased property owner; the other owner did not appear. The trial court authorized the expropriation of the property, and the attorney appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners, once husband and wife, had divorced in 1990 and neglected and ultimately abandoned their house on property in New Orleans' Ninth Ward. Complaints against the property regarding grass, rats, drug use, vagrancy, and vandalism had come in over the years. The house was demolished in 1997. No one appealed the adjudication of blight as provided by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:2575 and 2576 by filing a petition pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:964. The attorney argued that the intent of NORA to transfer the property to a private party, Habitat for Humanity, made the acquisition violative of La. Const. art. I, &sect;4(B), and that La. Const. art. I, &sect; 4(H) required that the property be offered first to the owners from whom it was taken. The court rejected these arguments, finding that La. Const. art. I, &sect; 4(B)(2)(c) unambiguously provided that this type of expropriation was a public purpose, so that the taking was authorized. This property was not taken for the predominant use of a private party nor for the purpose of transferring the property to a private person. It was taken for the public purpose of removing a threat to the public health or safety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed both the judgment overruling the exception of unconstitutionality and the judgment granting expropriation of the property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant's public intimidation conviction was reinstated on appeal, he was adjudicated a third felony habitual offender and sentenced to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The First Judicial District Court of Caddo Parish, Louisiana, determined that a downward departure was not warranted, and defendant's term of life imprisonment was upheld.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended the trial court imposed an unconstitutionally excessive sentence. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the trial court went into great detail to explain why it believed the mandatory sentence was, in fact, not constitutionally excessive. The record indicated that, after expressing some sympathy for  defendant and his situation, the trial court ultimately decided that from a legal perspective the mandatory sentence was appropriate. The trial court's decision was not unreasonable and was supported by the record. For instance, defendant's two prior felony convictions were crimes of violence, and the trial court stated that defendant showed his propensity for violence when he sent harassing letters to his wife while he was in prison. Defendant did not qualify as an exceptional case where a downward departure would have been warranted. And contrary to defendant's assertion, the trial court's compliance with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 was not required as the mandatory life sentence imposed for a third-felony habitual offender was prescribed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(b)(ii).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Ouachita, Louisiana, convicted defendant of driving while intoxicated, fourth offense. He was sentenced to 20 years at hard labor, the first 60 days without the benefit of parole, to be served consecutively to any other sentence and a $5,000 fine, in default of which he was to serve an additional year in jail consecutive to his hard labor sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the 20-year sentence at hard labor was constitutionally excessive for a 64-year-old man entering a guilty plea to fourth offense DWI. The appellate court found that the sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive. The trial court provided a considered discussion of the reasons for the sentence it was imposing, including the potential danger to society posed by a lesser sentence for a defendant with a proven record of recidivism. The trial court carefully analyzed the circumstances, defendant's repeated criminal behavior, and the fact that the instant DWI violation occurred while defendant was on supervised probation for his three prior convictions. The sentence imposed did not shock the sense of justice, was not grossly out of proportion to the seriousness of the offense, and did not needlessly inflict pain and suffering. Defendant was ordered to participate in a substance abuse treatment program. The appellate court vacated the illegally lenient sentence and remanded for resentencing. The trial court also had to make a new determination of defendant's financial condition, and if appropriate, should dismiss the default time as mandated by law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was affirmed; the sentence imposed by the court was vacated and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Twenty-Eight Judicial District Court, Parish of LaSalle, Louisiana, convicting him of sexual battery, and sentencing him to serve twenty-five years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During the period between March 1 and March 31, 2007, it was alleged that defendant touched the vagina of his eleven-year-old daughter on two separate occasions. Defendant also rubbed her breasts. Defendant subsequently entered a plea of guilty to sexual battery. The appellate court ruled that defendant's sentence was not excessive. The mandatory minimum sentence for sexual battery was not excessive on its face, as a mandatory minimum sentence was presumed to be constitutional. Based on the fact defendant committed a sexual act against his own daughter and violated a position of trust, the appellate court could not say the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence was excessive in the instant case. Also, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:43.1(C) did not allow for the consideration of defendant's actual conduct, the injury inflicted upon the victim, or the sentencing guidelines. The Louisiana Legislature sought to protect innocent children by enacting the penalty provision at issue, and defendant failed to present facts particular to his case that would support a departure from the mandatory minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana), which sentenced her, after a guilty plea, to the maximum sentence of 30 years for vehicular homicide under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:32.1, and the maximum of six months on each of three counts of vehicular negligent injuring under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:39.1, to be served concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the maximum sentence of 30 years was constitutionally excessive under the circumstances of her case. On appeal, the court found that defendant was not the worst type of offender for whom maximum sentences were reserved. Testimony established that defendant did not have a problem with drugs until five to eight years prior to the accident which killed a victim. Prior to her own injury in a car accident, defendant had no problems with the law and was not involved in illegal activity. Defendant became addicted to pain killers and suffered depression due to her bad second marriage and her inability to overcome her addiction. Defendant was also raising two sons, virtually on her own, during this time. The court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion when it sentenced defendant to the maximum without adequate consideration of the circumstances in the case. Imposition of the maximum sentence of 30 years was grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime in violation of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 and was nothing more than a needless imposition of pain and suffering.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court severed defendant's misdemeanor sentences, vacated the 30 year sentence imposed on the conviction for vehicular homicide and remanded the matter to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not file a motion to quash or make the argument of untimeliness in the trial court; therefore, the argument could not be raised for the first time on appeal. The State had no obligation to provide defendant with its proof of the multiple offender bill prior to the hearing. The record of the pleas and the court minutes indicated that defendant was apprised of his right to a jury trial when he entered his guilty pleas. The Court of Appeal of Louisiana held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to twenty years for distribution of hydrocodone, ten years for obstruction of justice, and twenty-five years for conspiracy to distribute marijuana. Defendant was a career criminal involved in the trafficking of dangerous drugs, and the sentences were within the statutory ranges. The sentences were not excessive under La. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was 15 years old at the time of the murders, was convicted of three counts of second-degree murder in the murder of his parents and his alleged coconspirator. The appellate court affirmed, stating that the evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant possessed the requisite intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm on his parents. In defendant's second recorded statement to an investigator, defendant admitted to shooting his parents and the jury apparently chose to believe that statement over the previous statement in which defendant labeled the alleged coconspirator as the gunman. The victims were also shot numerous times, with multiple gunshot wounds to the upper portions of their bodies. Some of the gunshot wounds inflicted on defendant's mother were at very close range. The mandatory life sentences were appropriate given the senselessness of the three murders. The sentences were not grossly disproportionate to the offenses committed by defendant under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana), which sentenced him to serve 15 years at hard labor after he had entered a plea of guilty to the offenses of vehicular homicide, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:32.1(A)(1) and (2), and first-degree vehicular negligent injuring, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:39.2(A)(1) and (2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had pled guilty to vehicular homicide and first-degree vehicular negligent injuring. He was sentenced again after a remand to serve 15 years at hard labor, 8 years to be served without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence, and to pay a fine of $2,000. Defendant argued that his sentence was excessive because he was not the worst type of offender, and that his sentence was cruel, unusual, and excessive under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The appellate court disagreed and affirmed. Jurisprudence setting sentences in similar cases offered widely disparate sentences being assessed for the same crime. In the instant case, the question of whether the instant sentence was deemed to have shocked the sense of justice or made no measurable contribution to acceptable penal goals, was answered in the negative. The sentence was structured by the trial judge to fit the facts as determined by the court. The sentence was not so grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime as to have been considered shocking. The relevant question was whether the trial court abused its broad sentencing discretion, not whether another sentence might have been more appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence showed that the maternal grandparents enjoyed a close and loving relationship with the children prior to their mother's death. The grandfather had served a prison sentence 40 years earlier. After the grandmother obtained court-ordered visitation, the father did not communicate with her to arrange for further visits. Conflicting testimony was presented regarding disputes between the parties. The trial court found the grandmother more credible and determined that the father's failure to contact her required a judgment providing for specific hours of visitation. The court found no violation of the father's due process rights under U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV because the trial court, in determining the best interests of the children under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:344, reasonably considered the facts of the case and made a specific credibility finding that was adverse to the father. Although the trial court did not specifically refer to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 136(B) in its reasons for judgment, its findings adequately addressed the relevant factors. The trial court reasonably gave little weight to the grandfather's felony conviction because it had occurred so long ago.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, convicting him of molestation of a juvenile, in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the early part of 2002, defendant, then age 32, had lewd contact and nonconsensual sex in western Caddo Parish with a 14-year-old female. The age difference between the two was almost exactly 18 years. The required unanimous six-person jury found defendant guilty of molestation of a juvenile, and defendant was sentenced to life at hard labor, without benefits. Defendant argued that the State should have proven venue at trial by a preponderance of the evidence. Venue was never placed at issue in the trial court, not before the trial, not during the trial, not in argument, not in any requested jury charge, and not in the motion for postverdict judgment of acquittal. The appellate court ruled that under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 615, defendant's failure to file a motion to quash waived any issue of venue. Also, the record did not support a finding that trial counsel's failure to file a motion to quash fell below the objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms and resulted in actual prejudice to defendant. Furthermore, the jury heard the victim testify as to the force used by defendant and felt it sufficient to render a guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>

Ultimately, the Office of Workers' Compensation, District 7 (Louisiana), applied the league's collective bargaining agreement and awarded the employee back compensation benefits, plus costs. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the employee contended the workers' compensation court incorrectly calculated his average weekly wage and thus incorrectly determined his supplemental earnings benefits. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the workers' compensation court correctly calculated the employee's average weekly wage based on the amount he actually earned prior to his injury, and not on his contract amount. The fact that the employer ultimately paid the employee his entire contract amount plus severance was immaterial. The appellate court also found that the employee was entitled to two years supplemental earnings benefits under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1221(3)(a) if he could prove he was unable to earn wages equal to 90 percent or more of his wages at the time of injury. The workers' compensation court correctly applied the collective bargaining agreement, which stated that the team was entitled to 25 weeks credit against any compensation liability assessed since the employee was paid his entire contract amount. The employee was not entitled to attorney's fees and penalties as the team had a valid defense to the employee's claims and were ultimately successful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, that convicted him of video voyeurism involving a juvenile under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:283B(4) and distribution of marijuana to a person under the age of 18 under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:981C, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court held that, where defendant allowed a teenaged girl and her boyfriend to use a bedroom in his home and secretly videotaped them, the evidence supported the video voyeurism conviction. Although defendant argued that the evidence failed to prove a lewd and lascivious intent, other videotapes taken by defendant were admitted showing teenaged girls nude or scantily clan dancing suggestively or masturbating. The evidence enabled the jury to infer that defendant's sexual proclivities leaned toward teenaged girls and that he secretly taped the girl and her boyfriend intending to watch the video for his sexual gratification. Further, although there was no expert testimony regarding testing and identification of the substance seized from defendant's home, the evidence supported defendant's drug conviction because the 14-year-old girl testified about how she felt after smoking the substance defendant gave to her and a police officer assigned to the narcotics division testified that he smelled marijuana when he entered defendant's home, that he found marijuana in defendant's home, and that defendant admitted that some of his videotapes showed juveniles smoking marijuana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of conviction was affirmed, but the case was remanded to the trial court with instructions to inform defendant in writing of his sex offender registration and notification requirements under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his manslaughter conviction and 30-year sentence and the appellate court affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence. Defendant did not object below to the responsive verdict of manslaughter. Accordingly, he was entitled to a reversal only if the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction of the charged offense, second-degree murder, as set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1. The trial judge made a credibility call to accept testimony refuting defendant's version that the gun accidentally discharged. The appellate court was unable to say that the trial court was clearly wrong in its evaluation of the witnesses' testimony. Because the evidence was sufficient to prove second-degree murder, it was sufficient to support the responsive verdict of manslaughter. Defendant's sentence was improper because there was no evidence that defendant formed the specific intent to kill the victim at some time prior to the fight that broke out between the parties. Further, defendant had no history of violence and the record indicated that a 20-year sentence would fulfill all the requisites of the constitutional requirement of proportionate punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a city and a purchaser of property, sought review of an order from the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), which awarded judgment to plaintiffs, taxpayers and a mortgagee, in an action to declare a tax sale null and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers failed to pay the ad valorem taxes on their property for the 2001 tax year. The city notified them of a pending tax sale. The notice was sent via certified mail. A return receipt was signed by an employee of a physical therapy company that was housed on the subject property. The property was sold to the purchaser, subject to the right of redemption. Plaintiffs filed a petition for declaratory judgment, seeking to have the tax sale annulled. The trial court declared the sale null and void. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in declaring the tax sale null and void. The taxpayers did not dispute the fact that, prior to the tax sale, they received notice that the taxes were delinquent and that the sale was pending. The mortgagee of the property did not request notice as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2180.1(A). The court found no merit to the taxpayers' claim that the tax sale should be declared a nullity based on the city's failure to provide post-tax sale notice. The mortgagee and the taxpayers failed to meet their burden of proving the invalidity of the tax sale for lack of statutory notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Twenty-sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier, Louisiana, convicted defendant of two separate charges of obscenity as a first offender pursuant to a plea bargain agreement. Defendant was sentenced to serve three years' imprisonment at hard labor for each conviction, with the sentences to be served concurrently. Defendant was also ordered to register as a sex offender and to pay a fine. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the sentence was excessive and the imposition of a maximum sentence was unconstitutionally excessive. The appellate court found that the record, including the confidential information contained in the presentence investigation (PSI) report regarding defendant's criminal history and the fact and circumstances surrounding the crimes, clearly supported the trial court's imposition of the maximum sentences. The trial court properly acted within its discretion in assessing defendant as a &quot;worst offender&quot; and his crimes of obscenity as the &quot;worst offenses.&quot; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106G(1) clearly provided for a fine of not less than $1,000, nor more than $2,500, or in default, imprisonment. Defendant's sentence could not be imposed without the stipulation that it be without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence. The information contained in the PSI confirmed that no victims were juveniles. The portion of defendant's sentence requiring him to register as a sex offender was vacated. The portion of the sentence assigning all future cases involving defendant to his own docket violated La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 253.1 and public policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions were affirmed. The portions of defendant's sentence denying him benefits, requiring registration as a sex offender, ordering jail time in lieu of payment of fines and specifying that any further charges against defendant be assigned to the trial judge's own docket were vacated; in all other respects, the sentences of defendant were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 19th Judicial District Court, in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, granted summary judgment in favor of appellee member insurer, and denied appellant Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association's (LIGA) cross-motion for summary judgment on the same legal issue. LIGA appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The member contended that the word &quot;contribution&quot; used in La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 8.1(F) and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1395(D)(2) was unambiguous and referred to assessments made by LIGA to its member insurers. The appellate court disagreed. Using the member's historic premiums for the year prior to assessment as the basis for calculation of the assessment, and using that assessment to offset covered claims arising prior to the member's admission to LIGA did not amount to an unconstitutional retroactive &quot;contribution&quot; coerced from the member. Its contribution was still prospective in nature, that was, assessed and paid after the date of the member's admission as a member insurer. LIGA was only responsible for &quot;covered claims,&quot; a statutorily-defined term having a precise, technical meaning. The legislature was more concerned with protection of LIGA's solvency from a potential insolvency of the member rather than protection of the member from assessment by LIGA. If the member sought and was granted the benefit of protection by LIGA on the same terms as other members, then it was only fair that it should participate in and contribute to LIGA on the same terms as other members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and summary judgment was rendered in LIGA's favor, dismissing the petition and cause of action of the member insurer with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff survivor brought a wrongful death action against defendants, a truck driver, an employer, a parish, a vacuum services company, and insurers. The 40th Judicial District Court, Parish of St. John the Baptist, Louisiana, entered several summary judgments that dismissed the survivor's tort claims. The survivor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent was driving on a highway in the parish when he crashed into the truck driver's rig. The survivor asserted that the parish and the vacuum services company were negligent in entering into a contract, allowing sanitary wastewater to be trucked into a treatment facility. The survivor alleged that the truck driver failed to maintain a proper lookout, and the employer negligently hired and trained the truck driver. On appeal, the survivor asserted, inter alia, that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the vacuum services company, the employer, and the parish on the basis of statutory immunity under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800.17. The appellate court found that the motions for summary judgment were improper because the movers failed to establish that vacuum services company and the employer were state agents, contractors, or representatives. Further, for &sect; 9:2800.17 to apply, the parish had to show that the wastewater was from Hurricane Katrina. Finally, the trial court did not err in dismissing a duty to warn claim against the vacuum services company because the duties of the Department of Transportation and Development included a duty to warn.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the judgment granting partial summary judgment in favor of the vacuum services company on the duty to warn claim. The appellate court vacated judgments granting summary judgment on the issue of statutory immunity in favor of the vacuum service company and the insurance company; the judgment in favor of the parish; the judgment in favor of the insurer, the employer, and the truck driver. The matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana) of two counts of armed robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his two consecutive fifteen year sentences were constitutionally excessive. The court of appeal disagreed. At sentencing, the trial judge in the case specifically noted both defendant's youth and his extensive juvenile record, as well as his arrest record. The judge noted the seriousness of the armed robberies and the fact that one of the victims thought he was going to die. The judge stated that he had considered the sentencing guidelines and found that any other sentence would deprecate from the seriousness of the crime. Defendant chose not to accept a plea bargain. Furthermore, as the State noted in brief, during the trial the trial court heard the testimony of both victims in great detail, thus making the judge aware of the severity of the armed robberies. The State also noted that the trial court took into account the extensive arrests and juvenile record of defendant. For those reasons, the sentences imposed were not vindictive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was remanded for correction of the commitment minute entry to have it conform with the transcript. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The requester's written public records request sought email records from a number of city council members. These emails were stored in the city's server, an electronic filing cabinet. Fearing the imminent disposal of the emails, the requester enlisted the assistance of a sanitation department employee, who facilitated pick-up and production of the emails. The documents were therefore produced without the city's attorneys reviewing them for privileged material. Approximately 3 months after the release of the documents, the city sought and received a preliminary injunction allowing it to review the documents for privileged material prior to the requester's publication of them. The court held that such a prior restraint violated the requester's rights under the First Amendment, although the requester did not raise any First Amendment arguments below. While the requester might be subject to discovery rules and ethical rules preventing disclosure, such as La. St. Bar art. XVI, R. 4.4(b), and La. Code Civ. Proc. art. 1424(D), and privileged materials were not public records under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:4.1(C), the requester's First Amendment rights were paramount.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, husband and wife, brought a medical malpractice action against defendant hospital in the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana). After their deaths, their children proceeded. The children asked the district court to approve their petitions to settle their claims against the hospital so that they could obtain payments from the Patient's Compensation Fund (PCF). The district judge approved the petitions. The PCF appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband received a blood transfusion in the hospital in 1985 and contracted AIDS, which he unknowingly communicated to his wife. The husband died in 1988; the wife in 1995. The PCF filed peremptory exceptions of no cause of action and no right of action to the petition to settle the wife's claim pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 927(A)(5) and (6). The court held that  the exception of no cause of action was appropriate based on the law of the case: the court had previously held that the Medical Malpractice Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.41 et seq., did not apply to the wife's claim because she was not a &quot;patient&quot; as defined under the Act. The court held that the PCF had standing to object in order to protect the integrity of its fund. As to the husband's claim, the PCF could not urge the exception of prescription because the hospital had settled the claim. Because the patient had settled, no constitutional challenge to the Act survived, and therefore the PCF did not have the right to intervene under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.44(D)(2)(b)(xii).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the district court's denial of the exception of prescription as to the husband's claim, its approval of the settlement on behalf of the husband, and its denial of the PCF's motion to intervene. The court reversed the district court's approval of the settlement with the wife. The court remanded the husband's claim for trial of damages in excess of the $ 100,000 settlement, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.44(C)(5)(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs' property was subjected to several servitudes, including one in favor of a lot located behind plaintiffs' land. After construction began of a paved road on the servitude, plaintiffs alleged that their land was converted into a public street for public use. Summary judgment was granted for defendants, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court noted that a resubdivision plan and its accompanying documents were executed prior to the plaintiffs' purchase of the property. They were sufficient to constitute a dedication of the servitude to public use, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:5051. Also, the evidence offered in support of the motion for summary judgment was sufficient to establish an implied dedication prior to plaintiffs' purchase of the land. The evidence established the combination of an unequivocally manifested intent to dedicate on the part of the owner and an equally clear intent to accept on the part of the public. The appellate court declined to hear an issue relating to an extinguishment of the servitude because trial court made no ruling on it, and the affirmance of the summary judgment on dedication of the servitude concluded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's juror challenge under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 797 because, although the juror said that his relationships with defense counsel, the assistant district attorney, and one of the investigators would influence him, he did not say whether he would be influenced in favor of the State or the defense. The juror also indicated that he could follow the law, would hold the State to its burden of proof, would give defendant the presumption of innocence, would find him not guilty if the case was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and would not hold it against defendant if he chose not to testify. Further, the trial court did not err under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 831A and 841 in granting the State's challenge for cause to a prospective juror outside of defendant's presence because defense counsel was present to protect defendant's interests at the conference during which the juror expressed concern for her safety due to the fact that she lived near the crime scene and defendant's residence and because defendant's presence would likely have inhibited inquiry into the juror's safety concerns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury found defendant guilty of attempted aggravated rape and three counts of aggravated rape. The Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu, Louisiana, denied defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal. He was sentenced to fifty years at hard labor for attempted aggravated rape and to life imprisonment on each count of aggravated rape. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with several sexual offenses against children. He was charged with having committed the offensive acts against one of his victims between May 1, 1977 and December 31, 1980; at that time the penalty for aggravated rape was death. Therefore, the trial court was required to comply with the procedural rules for capital cases, such as a unanimous jury and sequestration of the jury. The Court of Appeal of Louisiana held that the trial court committed reversible error by convicting defendant of one count of aggravated rape based on a verdict in which only 10 out of 12 jurors found him guilty. The trial court's failure to sequester the jury was harmless, as defendant did not object and a death sentence was not imposed. The testimony of the child victims was sufficient to support his conviction for the sex offenses. Under the statutory scheme that applied at the time defendant committed his crimes, the trial court erred by imposing his sentences without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction for one count of aggravated rape was reversed, and the sentence was reversed; defendant's remaining convictions were affirmed. Defendant's sentences for the remaining two counts of aggravated rape were amended to delete the portion of the sentences to be served without benefits. Defendant's sentence for the attempted aggravated rape conviction was vacated and remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a livestock owner and his insurer, appealed a judgment from the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana), which, in a jury trial, ruled in favor of plaintiff driver in a negligence action. The trial court found that the insurer acted in bad faith in its handling of the driver's property damage claim and awarded a penalty to the driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While driving on a rural roadway on a foggy night, the driver collided with a bull that had broken through the owner's fence. She sustained personal injuries, and her vehicle was totaled. The owner presented evidence that he and his son had searched for the bull; however, the owner had not alerted the authorities to the bull's escape. Prior to trial, the parties stipulated that the location of the accident was a closed range area on the date of the accident. The jury instruction was based upon La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:2803. The driver's uncontroverted testimony established that the insurer never contacted her to investigate her claim. The court held that because the accident occurred in a closed range area, the owner was presumed negligent under &sect; 3:2803 and was required to prove that he had taken reasonable precautions to keep the bull in an enclosed area and to prove how the bull escaped. The trial court did not err by not instructing under an ordinance instead. The burden of proof rested upon the owner to exculpate himself from even the slightest degree of negligence. The facts supported a bad faith finding and penalty under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 22:1892(A)(3), 22:1973.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee City filed a petition for injunctive relief and order of abatement against appellees, a company and its owner (owner), for supporting the maintenance of a nuisance by knowingly permitting prohibited activity to exist on the owner's bar or bar/restaurant. The Twenty-First Judicial District Court of Livingston Parish, Louisiana, rendered a judgment and order of abatement. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the owner contended, inter alia, that the City had no legal right to close the bar or bar/restaurant located on his property through an abatement action, and the district court erred in finding that the owner knowingly permitted maintenance of a nuisance. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the relief the City was seeking was specifically provided for under the abatement statutes,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4711 et seq., and that the enjoining and abating of a nuisance was a civil remedy over which the district court had subject matter jurisdiction. Contrary to the owner's assertions, the City was not required in its petition, in addition to its well-pled allegations, to describe the specific incidents where the owner knowingly permitted prohibited activity; the City's notices of violation to the owner were sufficient and stated a cause of action. The testimony and evidence of overwhelming criminal activity on the premises and the testimony that the owner and proprietors were aware of this activity, yet did not take sufficient precautions or measures to curtail or eliminate this activity, showed that they knowingly permitted these prohibited activities to exist.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant petitioner sought habeas relief, contending he was entitled to early release based on good time credit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the petitioner raised several issues contending the trial court erred in interpreting La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:574.4(S) and that he had a constitutionally protected interest in the good time that he earned. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the intention of the legislature in enacting the statute was to impose the additional requirement of an approved residency plan prior to the release of prisoners incarcerated for sex crimes, whether they were released by parole or by order of the office of adult services. The reason the petitioner was not released on his good time discharge date was because he did not have an approved residence plan. The fact that he had a constitutionally protected interest in good time did not deprive the legislature of the right to enact legislation that possibly had the effect of impacting that statutorily created interest. And the fact that the Department could not deprive the petitioner of good time without a hearing did not have any legal relevance to the situation here because the Department did nothing to deprive petitioner of his good time; rather, the Department was prohibited by statute from releasing the petitioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff grandparents filed a motion and rule for contempt against defendant mother in the Seventh Judicial District Court, Parish of Concordia (Louisiana). The trial court denied the mother's exception of no cause of action, ordered visitation for the grandparents, ordered the mother to inform the child of the existence of her biological father, and found the mother in contempt. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother and father had one baby and were divorced a year later. The father died not long after the divorce, and the grandparents (his parents) and the mother agreed to a visitation schedule. Meanwhile, the mother remarried and had another child, her third. The grandparents claimed that the mother had twice denied them visitation. The court held that the trial court erred in not granting the mother's exception of no right of action as to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:344. The father was divorced at the time of his death and neither interdicted nor incarcerated; &sect; 9:344 was inapplicable. The court found that the consent judgment affording grandparent visitation created an extraordinary circumstance, allowing visitation under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 136(B); however, the extensive grandparent visitation granted, two weekends per month, was unreasonable. They lived three hours apart; the mother was caring for three children who had other visitation obligations. The court reduced the amount of visitation to one weekend a month, with the grandparents doing the driving. The mother, not the court, could decide when her daughter should be told about her biological father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court as to its denial of the exception of no cause of action only as it pertained to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:344. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment awarding grandparent visitation but reduced the amount of time to one weekend per month, with the grandparents in charge of transportation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 2003, the property owner secured a permit from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to operate a construction and debris landfill. In 2008, the city-parish determined that the landfill had to comply with the greenbelt and buffer requirements provided in an ordinance. The owner ceased landfill operations and filed a petition for a preliminary injunction. The owner claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court denied the preliminary injunction. On appeal, the court found that the owner failed to prove that the city-parish threatened any irreparable injury. Because a showing of irreparable harm was necessary to prove entitlement to a preliminary injunction, and the owner failed to meet that burden, the court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of the preliminary injunction. Further, the owner failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. While completing the process to get a permit from DEQ, the owner never took any steps to ensure compliance with the ordinance, or sought a waiver from those parts of the ordinance it found burdensome by petitioning the city-parish for a waiver or variance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana) of possession of cocaine, greater than 28 grams and less than 200 grams in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(F)(1)(a). Defendant appealed, raising many issues including ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised many issues on appeal, but the court affirmed. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because he had constructive possession of the cocaine seized. The trial court concluded that defendant's explanation for excluding a juror was a pretext of discrimination. The court did not disturb this on appeal. The juror declared that she could be fair and impartial and there was no indication that her part-time employment in a church nursery would affect her ability to be fair. Thus, defendant's seemingly race-neutral explanation was not plausible or supported by the record. Because, contrary to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 841(A), defendant failed to object to the trial court's ruling regarding another juror, defendant did not preserve the right to appeal this ruling. Given that a letter not part of the record could not be considered regarding defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, plus the record lacked information needed to substantiate defendant's claim, the claim could not be resolved on appeal and had to be relegated to post-conviction relief under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 930.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The ineffective assistance matter was relegated to post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant fireman brought a civil service claim against his employer, appellee fire district, for denial of procedural due process when he was terminated. The Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier, Louisiana, granted summary judgment in favor of the district and dismissed it from the suit on the grounds that the fireman was not entitled to the protections of the Louisiana civil service law. The fireman appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the fireman contended the district court erred by dismissing the district from the suit and granting it summary judgment. The appellate court agreed, finding that even if La. Const. art. X, &sect; 16 extended constitutional protection to a small subset of fire protection districts, the Article made no express prohibition barring the general plenary power of the legislature to enact civil service laws for all other fire protection districts. Likewise, if the purpose of La. Const. art. X, &sect; 16 was to provide constitutional protection to only a subset of all fire protection districts, such purpose was not inconsistent or irreconcilable with the legislative purpose of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2531 et seq., which had previously established civil service for all fire protection districts. As such, the appellate court concluded that the civil service system of &sect; 33:2531 et seq. applied to the district, the fireman's employer, and summary judgment in its favor was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The summary judgment was reversed; the fireman's motion for partial summary judgment was granted; and the case was  remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the juvenile court did not err by denying the juvenile's motion to suppress marijuana because the officer's actions did not constitute either an actual stop or an imminent actual stop, and therefore, the juvenile abandoned the bag containing marijuana prior to any unlawful intrusion into his right to be left alone from governmental interference.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that &sect; 9:5605 was constitutional and therefore the firefighter's action was properly dismissed. The court held that &sect; 9:5605 did not violate La. Const. art.

The prisoner alleged that the trial court erred in dismissing his petition because the trial court had original jurisdiction to hear his petition for mandamus, alleging La. Rev. Stat.

The prisoner's challenge to the constitutionality of the statute was required to be questioned first in the trial court, and it was required to be specifically pled. The issue was not properly before the appellate court. Under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed a delinquency petition against both juveniles charging them with illegal possession of a handgun by a juvenile in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.8. The juveniles both filed a motion to quash claiming that the offenses could not be the basis of a delinquency petition and that &sect; 14:95.8 was not a charge that met the definition of a delinquent act under La. Child. Code Ann. art. 804.3. The court found that there was a major distinction between the adult offense condemned by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95(A)(1), carrying a concealed weapon, and the underlying offense in &sect; 14:95.8, which condemned merely the knowing possession of a handgun by a person under seventeen. None of the operative provisions of &sect; 14:95(A) condemned what was prohibited by &sect; 14:95.8(A). Because an adult could not be charged with a violation of &sect; 14:95.8 and La. Child. Code Ann. art. 804.3 defined a delinquent act as an act committed by a child of 10 years of age or older which if committed by an adult was designated an offense under the statutes or ordinances of the State of Louisiana, the delinquency proceedings in the juvenile court could not be based on a violation of &sect; 14:95.8.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 2001, a grand jury indicted defendant on two counts of first degree murder. Defendant pled not guilty and was later found incompetent to stand trial. Almost two years later, the trial court held another sanity hearing and determined defendant was competent to stand trial. In June 2005, defendant changed his former pleas to not guilty by reason of insanity. In March 2007, defendant withdrew those pleas and entered guilty pleas on both counts of first degree murder. The trial court accepted defendant's pleas and sentenced defendant to life imprisonment. Defendant was granted an out-of-time appeal. Defendant argued that the trial judge should have recused herself under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 671 and refused to accept his guilty pleas because she represented defendant at his arraignment. The appellate court ruled that defendant was barred on appeal from raising the issue of the trial judge's failure to recuse because he entered an unconditional guilty plea and the failure to recuse was a non-jurisdictional defect that was waived by an unconditional guilty plea. Also, the appellate court declined to consider the trial judge's failure to recuse sua sponte as an error patent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city's claim was filed by the adjuster for the self-insured risk fund covering the city. The employee relied upon La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1314 and La. Admin. Code tit. 40, &sect; I.5545,  to argue that the city's claim should be barred because its claim was filed by an insurance adjuster instead of an attorney. The court rejected this argument, observing that &sect; I.5545 clearly stated that the presence of an attorney was required in all hearings. The use of these specific words ruled out any generalization that could be interpreted to entail the requirement of an attorney for filings. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1310(A) and &sect; I.5545, an adjuster could file the 1008 on behalf of the insurer, but counsel was required to be present and represent the company or the insurer at all hearings before the Workers' Compensation Judge.</SPAN></P>

The district court granted the city's motion for summary judgment, and the taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city, a home rule city under La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 4, allowed its employees who had registered as domestic partners to claim dependent benefits for their partners. The court held that the taxpayers were not entitled to summary judgment because their motion was premature under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 966 because the city had not filed its answer. The taxpayers contended that no law authorized the creation of the city's domestic partnership scheme, making it violative of La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9. The court rejected this position, noting that the ordinance did not control the making and administration of domestic partnerships but merely provided a registration mechanism. There was nothing in the ordinance that &quot;governed&quot; private or civil relationships in violation of art. VI, &sect; 9; the registry ordinance did not rule domestic partnerships by right or authority, exercise a directing or restraining influence over the partnerships, or guide them. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:3062 allowed the city to contract for insurance protection for its officers and employees; therefore, the provision of health benefits was provided by law within the meaning of La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

Later, defendant agreed to talk with the detectives and signed his name on the warning and waiver of rights form next to the word &quot;refused.&quot; Defendant was not moved from room to room during the process and defendant's wife was not brought to the station until after defendant began making his statement. Defendant acknowledged that the waiver of rights form was read to him before he signed it. Defendant also admitted saying he had told the truth at the conclusion of his statement. The State established that defendant was advised of his rights and that he voluntarily waived them prior to making the statement. There was no evidence that the statement was made under the influence of fear, duress, intimidation, menaces, threats, inducements or promises.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, convicting him of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1, adjudicating him as a second felony offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, and sentencing him to 20 years at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested and convicted after police officers found drugs and a gun in his vehicle following a traffic stop. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because: (1) the officer verified that the vehicle belonged to the mother of defendant's child and defense witnesses agreed that defendant drove it 90 percent of the time, so a rational juror could find that he exercised full dominion and control over the car; and (2) a rational juror could also conclude that the large semiautomatic revolver, even enclosed in the console, was within the driver's easy reach in the compact vehicle. The district court did not err by allowing the State to file an amended bill of information after the trial had begun and denying defendant's motion for a mistrial because both bills charged defendant with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and therefore the amendment did not charge a new offense or add a new crime. Both felonies had been disclosed to defendant in discovery. The trial court did not err by adjudicating defendant as a habitual offender because the holding in the Baker case applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction and multiple offender adjudication were affirmed. The sentence was corrected to delete the imposition of a fine and was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Claimant employee filed a disputed claim for compensation with the Office of Workers' Compensation (OWC) seeking reinstatement of benefits from defendant employer. The employer filed a variety of exceptions, including lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The OWC determined that it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed the employee's case. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee's original injury was in 1980, before the enactment of the Workers' Compensation Act. She therefore filed her claim in district court and eventually entered into a consent judgment. In 2006, the employer ceased paying her benefits. The court held that the employee was not asserting a new claim, nor was she seeking modification of a prior order. She sought to enforce a prior judgment of the district court. Therefore, the district court had continuing jurisdiction to enforce its orders. Accordingly, the civil district court, not the OWC, had jurisdiction over the employee's claim. The 2005 amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1310.3(E) only added to the illustrative list of the types of claims in which the OWC was vested with original, exclusive jurisdiction. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1310.3(E), providing that the OWC was vested with exclusive jurisdiction over all claims or disputes arising out of the worker's compensation chapter, did not apply because the employee's claim arose out of prior law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the OWC dismissing the employee's case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 19th Judicial District Court, in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, granted a preliminary injunction in favor of appellee importer enjoining appellant, Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry for the State of Louisiana's (Commissioner), authority to enforce the agency regulations regarding inspections for certain antibiotics in imported seafood. The Commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court noted that subject matter jurisdiction was conferred by the Louisiana Constitution, La. Const. art. 5, &sect; 2. The legislature could not, by statute, divest the district court of its constitutional subject matter jurisdiction to determine the legality of administrative regulations, and to issue an injunction preventing enforcement if the regulations were found to be illegally promulgated. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:963 did not divest the district court of its subject matter jurisdiction over the proceeding. Agency review of the constitutionality of the regulations was not a prerequisite to the importer's filing an action for injunctive relief since only the district court could decide the constitutionality of the regulations. The district court properly denied the Commissioner's dilatory exception raising the objection of prematurity, as well as the Commissioner's peremptory exception raising the objection of no cause of action. Because La. Admin. Code tit. 7, &sect; 35.511, was promulgated without legislative or constitutional authority, the district court properly issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the Commissioner's authority to enforce the unlawful regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed; the Commissioner's application for a supervisory writ of review was denied and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the 16th Judicial District Court, Parish of Iberia (Louisiana), convicting him of four counts of aggravated rape in violation of La.R.S. 14:42 and sentencing him to four consecutive life sentences at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for raping the four victims, his young nieces and stepdaughter. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for the aggravated rape of his stepdaughter because her testimony showed that defendant had sex with her in 1999 when she was 12 years old, not under the age of 12, as required by La.R.S. 14:42. However, the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction of forcible rape under La. R.S. 14:42.1 because the stepdaughter testified that defendant pushed her over the couch and had vaginal sexual intercourse with her, that her face was buried in the sofa during the incident, and when she pushed up from the couch and asked defendant to stop, he pushed her back down and continued. The court rejected defendant's contention that the time limitations for the institution of prosecution had lapsed with respect to the cases involving his nieces because in 1984, while the original prescriptive periods for the offenses were still running, La. Code Crim.P. art. 571 was amended to remove the time limitations on prosecution for aggravated rape. Defendant's life sentences without benefits were not excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction for the aggravated rape of his stepdaughter was vacated and a judgment of guilty was entered for the crime of forcible rape, and the case was remanded for resentencing on that conviction. Defendant's remaining convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, State of Louisiana, which convicted him of armed robbery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64, sentenced him to 35 years' imprisonment at hard labor, and imposed an additional five years imprisonment at hard labor under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64.3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that he was arrested without probable cause in Orleans Parish and that any statement given thereafter was illegal and inadmissible. Defendant also claimed that the State made improper comments during its closing argument and that his sentence under &sect; 14:64.3 was unconstitutional. The court held that because defendant was transported to Jefferson Parish pursuant to a valid arrest warrant, his argument that the Orleans arrest was illegal was moot. His confession and identification of himself from the bank's surveillance photos were admissible because they were given freely and voluntarily and not under duress or intimidation. The State's comments about fingerprint evidence was in response to defendant's closing argument raising the issue of the lack of fingerprint evidence. Although the jury did not specifically find that the crime was committed with a firearm, because the enhanced sentence did not increase the penalty beyond the maximum term, there was no due process violation in the application of &sect; 14:64.3. Finally, pursuant to the terms of &sect; 14:64.3 in effect at the time of the commission of the crime, defendant could not be sentenced to hard labor thereunder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the enhanced sentence, affirmed the remainder of the judgment, and remanded to the trial court for sentencing in accordance with the provisions of &sect;14:64.3 as written at the time of the commission of the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Ouachita (Louisiana) of attempted possession of a controlled dangerous substance (hydrocodone). Defendant received the maximum sentence of two and one-half years' imprisonment at hard labor. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that evidence of the driver's arrest for possession of cocaine and the marijuana found in the vehicle prejudiced the verdict by showing defendant's bad acts. The court of appeal disagreed. The central issue in the case was whether defendant had constructive possession of the hydrocodone pill. Thus, issues of defendant's knowledge and intent were necessary to the State's proof. Both the arrest of the driver for possession of crack cocaine and the discovery of the marijuana in the driver's door occurred simultaneously with the discovery of the hydrocodone. Those facts formed an integral part of the act that formed the basis for the proceedings. Moreover, facts relating to the existence of other drugs in the car had probative value and were relevant to issues of defendant's intent to possess, his exercise of dominion and control, and knowledge of the drug. The jury was free to infer that the driver's possession of cocaine exculpated defendant as he might have also placed the pill in the center console. Likewise, the jury could have inferred defendant's friends' joint enjoyment of illegal drugs.</SPAN></P>

The victim had a fractured skull with cerebral edema and cranial bleeding. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion for a post-verdict judgment of acquittal based on House Concurrent Resolution No. 3 (2008), which directed the Louisiana State Law Institute to study La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 814(C) to determine whether amendments were necessary to clarify the legislative intent behind that article. Defendant's conviction was proper under the Elaine case, which continued to be good law following the 1985 amendment to art. 814(C), because she failed to object to the inclusion of negligent homicide in the jury instructions. The court further held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because it would have supported the greater crime charged, manslaughter. The record showed that the victim died due to a major blow to his head and the only person with him during the time period in which he was injured that was capable of inflicting such a blow was defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana) of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1. He was sentenced to 15 years at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, but the trial court suspended the imposed fine. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised many issues on appeal, but the court affirmed. Given that the trial court imposed the mandatory sentence of 15 years as well as the mandatory fine permitted under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1(B) of $ 5,000 and then suspended that fine, the court found that there was no error patent. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding of possession in defendant's trial. At a minimum, defendant had constructive possession of the gun that was underneath the driver's seat when he was driving. The jury chose to believe that defendant's action proved his awareness of the presence of the gun and that he had the general criminal intent under La. Rev. Stat.

In light of the special relationship between the members of the NOPD and the public, conduct such as the police officer's clearly interfered with the efficient operation of the NOPD, violated the trust the public must have in the police force, and justified his termination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Civil District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, denied relator hospital's exception of improper venue on plaintiffs', administrator and heirs, wrongful death claim against relator and doctor for an alleged failure to diagnose the decedent's stomach cancer. The hospital sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The hospital argued that the trial court erred when it failed to find that Ascension Parish was the only proper venue for plaintiffs' suit. The hospital grounded its case on the application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46:1063 to the facts of the case. It argued that the statute was a specific statute which provided an exclusive venue provision. The appellate court determined that &sect; 46:1063 was not an exclusive venue provision that superseded La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5104(B). Thus, plaintiffs' wrongful death claim could proceed in Orleans Parish because the decedent died in Orleans Parish, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5104(B) provided that venue in a suit against a political subdivision was proper if brought in a parish in which the cause of action arose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Thirty-Sixth Judicial District Court, Parish of Beauregard (Louisiana) convicting him of two counts of aggravated rape, two counts of sexual battery, and two counts of indecent behavior with juveniles. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of life imprisonment for each rape count, 120 months at hard labor on each sexual battery count, and 84 months at hard labor on each indecent behavior count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence established that defendant touched, kissed and/or licked the vaginas of two girls under the age of thirteen. The court held that the evidence was legally sufficient to sustain his convictions for aggravated rape under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42, because penetration was not required for oral sexual intercourse. Defendant argued that his convictions for aggravated rape, sexual battery, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:43.1, and indecent behavior with juveniles, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81, constituted double jeopardy. The same conduct did not constitute the basis for each offense because the rape involved oral intercourse with defendant's tongue, the battery involved touching with his hand, and the indecent behavior required proof that the crimes were performed in the presence of the other victim. The court also found that defendant's remaining pro se assignments of error including ineffective assistance of counsel lacked merit. Pursuant to the court's review for errors patent on the face of the record, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 920, defendant's sentence was amended to reflect that dimunition eligibility was denied under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:537(A).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's sentences as amended. The court remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the evidence did not support a finding of intent. The appellate court found that the evidence established that the victim was in a defensive posture at the time of the shooting and that the bullet did not ricochet off of any other object or surface prior to hitting her, indicating a straight-on shot. A witness testified that defendant fled the scene immediately. The victim stated that defendant had just shot her. The evidence indicated that the gun was not discharged by accident. The trier of fact could have rationally inferred the specific intent of defendant from the circumstances of the case and, therefore, could have found that the evidence negated reasonable doubt as to defendant's intent. The trial court did not err in admitting evidence of defendant's batteries of previous girlfriends as a rational trier of fact could have weighed the evidence and found that defendant's guilt had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, even absent the testimony of the former girlfriends. The fact that the same penalty was a possibility under two different statutes was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana), which convicted him of attempted carjacking, a violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his convictions for attempted carjacking and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and the appellate court conditionally affirmed the judgment. The verdict indicated that the jury chose to believe the victim's testimony that defendant did not have permission to use the truck after the victim left defendant's residence and that credibility determination should not be second-guessed by the appellate court. Accordingly, defendant's conviction for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle was affirmed. His conviction for attempted carjacking was also affirmed because defendant dove head first through the victim's passenger window and told the victim to go. An officer also testified that it appeared to him that defendant attacked the victim and was trying to take the car. The jury was not irrational in choosing to favor the view of two police officers over that of the attempted carjacking victim. The matter was further remanded, in part for an evidentiary hearing in order for the trial court to determine whether there were reasonable ground to doubt defendant's capacity to proceed to trial and sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that: (1) a jury trial was not required for the habitual offender proceeding; (2) the State properly introduced the court minutes showing that defendant pled guilty to the predicate offenses and was represented by counsel at each plea; (3) under La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 841, defendant waived the argument that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he was the person who had been convicted of the prior offenses; (4) defendant failed to prove that the State's pursuit of the habitual offender bill was vindictive because he produced no evidence to suggest that the State filed the habitual offender bill of information for the purpose of deterring or punishing the exercise of his legal rights; and (5) defendant was not entitled to a downward departure from the mandatory minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Thirty-Sixth Judicial District Court, Parish of Beauregard (Louisiana) of two of six counts of felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:80. The trial court adjudicated defendant a fourth felony offender for purposes of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 and imposed concurrent 25 years at hard labor sentences. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised various issues on appeal, but the court affirmed. For purposes of defendant's convictions, there was sufficient evidence to prove that defendant, who was older than 19, participated in consensual oral sexual intercourse with the victim, who was younger than 17. Because the date of the offense was not an element of the crime, the State was not required to prove the offense occurred on the date alleged in the charging instrument, for purposes of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 468. The victim testified at trial, was cross-examined by the defense, offered testimony inconsistent with a prior statement, and then specifically refuted the veracity of her prior statement. Thus, under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 801(D), her inconsistent statements were nonhearsay and the trial court was not required to perform the balancing test of La. Code Evid Ann. art. 607(D)(2). Defendant was adjudicated a fourth felony offender and the applicable sentencing provision was La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(c)(i). Defendant's sentences were in the low-range of those possible, and the court did not find that the sentences were excessive under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee's attorney argued that an award of $750.00 for 17 hours of work amounted to an attorney fee of $44.12 an hour, which was arbitrary and capricious. He argued that the Attorney Fee Review Board established a minimum hourly rate of $100.00 and a maximum hourly rate of $400.00. The appellate court found that the conclusions reached by the hearing referee suggested that he intended to consider some of the factors established in the Rules of Professional Conduct. The record did not state how the factors were evaluated. The appellate court noted that the severity of the disciplinary action was generally not material to the amount of time an attorney spent in interviewing a client, conversing with opposing counsel, drafting pleadings or reviewing a file in preparation for a hearing. There was also merit in the employee's argument that his professional duty required him to put forth his best effort to represent his client no matter the penalty appealed from. There was no reasonable basis for a factual finding that the attorney did not expend 17 hours on behalf of the employee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the indictment, arguing that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.3 was invalid on its face because it suppressed protected speech. The appellate court disagreed, holding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.3 directly advanced a compelling state interest. It was evident beyond the need for elaboration that the state's interest in safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor was compelling. Further, the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constituted a government objective of surpassing importance. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.3 was narrowly tailored to prohibit criminal conduct, rather than protected speech. It was illegal to solicit a child for sex. This illegal conduct was not suddenly shielded from criminal liability when the pedophile hid behind a computer screen. Offers to engage in illegal transactions were categorically excluded from U.S. Const. amend. I protection. Because &sect; 14:81.3 was not substantially overbroad, it was unnecessary to consider its application to situations other than those which Louisiana could restrict consistent with the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:69. He was sentenced to ten years at hard labor. The State filed a habitual offender bill of information.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the habitual offender bill of information was untimely and was vindictive, having been filed because his original ten-year sentence was too low. Defendant never raised the issues of timeliness or prosecutorial vindictiveness in the trial court. He also failed to file a motion to quash the habitual offender bill, which was the proper method to challenge the bill under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 531-532. The court decided that the filing of the bill was timely. At the beginning of the sentencing hearing, before defendant's original sentence was imposed, the State informed the trial court that it was filing the habitual offender bill. Therefore, defendant received fair notice that he would be facing enhanced penalties. The bill of information was timely because it was filed on the same date as the defendant's sentencing hearing on the underlying offense. However, the State failed to introduce into evidence the documentation relating to defendant's 1996 conviction for attempted possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The court held that the State had failed to carry its burden of proving that defendant was a fourth felony offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated defendant's habitual offender sentence and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

In conducting a plain error review, the court held that, where the trial court did not advise defendant of his right to a formal hearing, of his right to have the State prove its case under the multiple offender statute by proving defendant's identity as the person who pled guilty, and of his right to remain silent, defendant was not informed of his statutory rights under La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Webster (Louisiana) of 23 counts of pornography involving juveniles, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.1. He was adjudicated as a second felony offender and sentenced to a total of 40 years at hard labor, without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in not requiring the State to designate which precise count of his recent convictions was to be subjected to the enhancement authorized by the habitual offender statute. The court rejected this contention because there was no contemporaneous objection either at the habitual offender hearing or sentencing hearing. Further, the error was immaterial and not prejudicial because the State could have enhanced all of defendant's convictions. Defendant next argued that his sentence was excessive for his non-violent voyeuristic compulsion. The court held that the trial court complied with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 in the imposition of sentence by examining defendant's prior criminal history of two counts of carnal knowledge of a juvenile and three counts of video voyeurism. The trial court did not err in deciding that defendant was a grave risk to the safety of the community and that he was desperately in need of correctional treatment in a custodial environment. Based upon the nature of the offenses and his criminal history of sex offenses involving juveniles, there was no abuse of discretion in the imposition of the maximum sentence.</SPAN></P>

The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents claimed that the suit was timely filed within one year of their knowledge that the hospital was covered by the Medical Malpractice Act (MMA), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.47, and the facts which gave rise to the malpractice claim against the hospital. The appellate court found that, when met with an exception of prescription filed in the district court during a pending medical panel review under the MMA, the plaintiff was required to prove the defense of contra non valentem as allowed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628. The defense was necessary because the hospital's actions and the baby's death occurred almost two years before the MRP letter which commenced the action against the hospital. The parents had the burden of proof at the hearing on the exception of prescription to establish evidence of their late discovery of the hospital's negligence, which they failed to do. Section 9:5628 was not unconstitutionally vague and deprive the parents of their day in court. The constitutionality of a statute had to be first questioned in the trial court and specially pleaded with the grounds for the claim particularized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Patients' Compensation Fund (PCF) and the patient sought review of the decision of the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which, in part, granted the State's motion for summary judgment involving the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42(B)(1) in a medical-malpractice case and failure to obtain an informed consent arising out of a tummy tuck. The patient had also been awarded damages from the PCF.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient filed an action against the doctor alleging malpractice and failure to obtain an informed consent. After settling with the doctor for less than $100,000, the patient proceeded to trial against the PCF and was awarded damages totaling $1,797,548. The trial court granted the PCF's posttrial motions and lowered the damages but denied the PCF's motion for a new trial. The patient raised the issue of the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42(B)(1) and the State intervened to address that issue and filed a motion for summary judgment, which the PCF adopted and which the trial court granted. The PCF and the patient appealed and the appellate court affirmed. The appellate court was unable to say that the jury was manifestly erroneous in finding that the increased risk of a wound problem was a material risk of the surgery that was not disclosed. The patient, corroborated by her uncle, testified that the doctor did not discuss the risks with her. Additionally, La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 1003 was not applicable because the authenticity of an original affidavit by a former employee of the doctor was questioned by the patient's counsel at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the 22nd Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Tammany (Louisiana) of one count of second-offense possession of marijuana and one count of possession of oxycodone. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that an officer's expert testimony should have been excluded because it was irrelevant and more prejudicial than probative. The court of appeal disagreed. Defendant's ownership of the OxyContin recovered from the trailer was the central fact at issue in the case. The defense claimed the State's case was based on guilt by association, and specifically denied that defendant had confessed his ownership of the OxyContin recovered from the trailer. The State's theory was that not only had defendant confessed his ownership of the OxyContin, he had further stated that the police had interrupted him and the other men around the table as they were about to &quot;shoot the half a pill of Oxycontin.&quot; The officer identified the OxyContin as a highly concentrated form of the drug and indicated that the spoon and unused hypodermic recovered from the trailer along with the OxyContin were consistent with the preparation of the drug for injection. The testimony made the existence of the defendant's alleged statements more probable, and thus, was relevant. The officer's specialized knowledge assisted the jury in understanding the evidence and determining facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, lessees of state water bottoms for the purpose of harvesting oysters, sued defendant, State of Louisiana, Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (DWF), and asserted that it breached its obligations under the lease. The Nineteenth Judicial District Court, In and For the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana granted the lessees' motion for partial summary judgment and denied DWF's motion for summary judgment. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Despite specific language by the legislature regarding the retroactivity of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 49:214.5 and 56:427.1, the lessees asserted that the retroactive application of the statutes in the instant case was unconstitutional. The court found that the retroactive application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect;. 49:214.5 and 56:427.1 created no contractual impairment of a constitutional dimension under La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 10, was justified by a significant and legitimate purpose, and was reasonable for the public policy of coastal restoration, which justified the retroactive application of the statutes with regard to the lessees' contractual rights. However, the trial court erred when it found that the lessees' vested rights in their cause of action were disturbed by the retroactive application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 49:214.5 and 56:427.1 in violation of the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions because the property rights of an oyster lessee were exclusively defined in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:423, and the rights granted in &sect; 56:423(B) had never been recognized as anything other than rights granted against third parties to the leases, not against the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was reversed. The lessees' motion for summary judgment was denied and summary judgment was granted in favor of DWF. The lessees' claims were dismissed with prejudice. All costs of the appeal were assessed to the lessees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Webster, Louisiana, that convicted him of molestation of a juvenile in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.2(A) and that sentenced him to 12 years in prison at hard labor under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that, where the 14-year-old victim became intoxicated at a party supervised by the 38-year-old defendant, where the victim awakened to find herself in defendant's bed and defendant having sex with her, and where the trial court found the victim's testimony to be credible and accepted her version of events over that of defendant despite the victim's intoxication at that time, the victim's testimony provided sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed a lewd or lascivious act upon the victim with the specific intent to gratify his sexual desire. Further, where defendant was the only adult present at a party attended by minors and created the situation that led to the lewd act by furnishing the victim with alcohol and by requiring her to stay at his house once she began drinking, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt defendant's use of his position of supervision or control to facilitate the commission of the crime under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81(A). As such, the sentence imposed under the harsher scheme provided by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81(C) was legal and supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier, Louisiana, that convicted him of possession with intent to distribute marijuana in a quantity exceeding 60 pounds in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(F)(1), arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence because the reasons given to justify the stop of his vehicle were mere pretext.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was stopped along an interstate because his window tint was illegal, his license plate was improperly displayed, and he was not wearing a seat belt. During the stop, the trooper discovered that defendant did not have a driver's license and that the vehicle was not registered. After defendant gave inconsistent answers to questioned posed by the trooper, the trooper learned that defendant had been convicted of felony marijuana possession and weapons charges in Texas. The trooper requested consent to search the vehicle, but defendant refused to consent. The trooper called for a K-9 unit, and the dog alerted the trooper to the presence of marijuana in the vehicle's trunk. On review, the court held that the trooper had a valid, reasonable suspicion that a traffic violation had occurred at the inception of the stop where the license plate was partially obscured and the windows were tinted. Once defendant's behavior gave rise of a suspicion of unlawful activity, the trooper called for a canine search. Once the dog alerted on the truck of the vehicle, the trooper had probable cause to search the vehicle for contraband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of conviction was affirmed. However, the court discovered an error patent. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(F)(1), the district court erred in sentencing defendant to serve his entire sentence without benefit of parole probation. Because defendant was eligible for either after serving the minimum sentence, the sentence was amended to provide that defendant would be eligible for parole or probation after serving five years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The candidate asserted that candidates for federal office were exempt from the CFDA; however, the trial court found that the candidate was governed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18: 463(A)(2)(a). On review, the court affirmed, finding that the trial court properly found that the candidate falsely certified on his notice of candidacy that he did not owe any outstanding fines, fees, or penalties pursuant to the CFDA as provided in &sect; 18:463(A). The CFDA did not impose substantial qualifications upon the right to hold office. Rather, the Act enforced legitimate state interests in governing campaign finance and a duty to protect the integrity of the political process as permitted under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 4, cl. 1. Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 18:1274 and 18:461(A)(1), the candidate for the primary election was required to make a certification under &sect; 18:463(A). Therefore, the objection to candidacy was properly filed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1401(A), and a false certification was ground for disqualification under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:492(A)(5). The court found sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of disqualification of the candidate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the disqualification. However, since the court was equally divided on the correctness of the trial court's ruling, the decree was issued as a separate per curiam opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After being convicted of public intimidation, defendant filed an appeal from a first ruling of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, holding that his life sentence without the benefit of probation or suspension of sentence was not excessive. Defendant also requested reconsideration of his sentence to a downward departure from the mandatory minimum life sentence without benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the trial court ruled that the life sentence without benefits was not excessive, defendant filed an appeal. Thereafter, the court ordered the trial court to hold a hearing addressing defendant's waiver of counsel and request for self-representation regarding his previous Johnson hearing. The trial court found that the record failed to reveal that defendant made a clear and unequivocal waiver of his right to counsel and that he was entitled to a new Johnson hearing. A new hearing was held and the trial court again determined that the life sentence was not excessive. Accordingly, the appeal from the trial court's first ruling was moot. In addition, the court held that despite its belief that defendant should not have been found guilty, in order for the court to depart downward from the mandatory minimum sentence under the Louisiana Habitual Offender Law, defendant had to establish a favorable factual basis with respect to reasons why he fell within those rare circumstances. Also, defendant had to present evidence consistent with the guidelines of State v. Johnson. Because defendant failed to do so his sentence could not be changes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the request and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana) convicted the defendant of one count of armed robbery, in violation of La.

Ann. &sect; 14:64, and on the basis of the fact that the instant conviction and his two prior convictions were crimes of violence, imposed the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment--which exceeded the statutory maximum for the charged offense--on the defendant as a third offender. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Neither the defendant's sentence nor the statute describing the sentences to be imposed for second and subsequent offenses, La.

Apprendi specifically excluded multiple offender proceedings from its holding requiring facts that increased a criminal penalty beyond a statutory maximum to be submitted to a jury. Furthermore, it was questionable whether the issue of the right to a jury trial had been preserved for future review, as the issue was not raised at the defendant's multiple offender hearing nor prior to the hearing. No motion to quash the multiple bill was ever filed, and no mention of the issue was made in the motion to reconsider the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction, multiple offender adjudication, and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient received care from the psychiatrist, and their doctor-patient relationship ended in 1988. When the patient began treating with another psychiatrist years later, she allegedly discovered that her current mental health problems stemmed from the care she had received from her former psychiatrist. She and her husband filed suit in 1998, claiming that the psychiatrist had falsely imprisoned her and held her in isolation in the psychiatric center by inducing her parents to believe she suffered from a disorder that required prolonged hospitalization. The district court dismissed the claim against the psychiatrist, the psychiatric center, and their insurers after finding that the claims were time barred. On review, the court held that the malpractice claim was not only prescribed on its face but was also barred by the three-year peremptive period of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628. This statute set forth an absolute three-year period beyond which medical malpractice claims could not be filed, and the period could not be tolled for any reason, including fraud or willful concealment. Because the patient's claim was extinguished, the district court properly dismissed the lawsuit.</SPAN></P>

The lessee deposited royalties owed under its mineral lease with the lessor into the registry of the district court. The district court ordered the funds paid to the lessor's successor. The lessor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessor was a levee district created in 1890. In 1938, the state conveyed certain property to the lessor. The lessor sold the property but reserved mineral rights. In 1968, the Louisiana legislature created the successor, a new levee district, which overlapped the lessor's territory. In 1989, the lessor entered into a mineral lease with the lessee. In 1997, the legislature enacted La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38:291P(3), which caused all rights and property owned by the lessor to be transferred to the successor. The court agreed with the district court that the successor district, not the lessor, was entitled to the royalties from the mineral lease. When the legislature enacted &sect; 38:291P(3), the lessor owned a servitude consisting of the right to explore and produce minerals on the property. That servitude was clearly included in the items transferred pursuant to &sect; 38:291P(3). The lessor's right to obtain mineral royalties attributable to the servitude was transferred with the servitude. The provisions for the creation of new levee districts in La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 38, were not applicable to the successor, because its organization was specifically sanctioned by art. VI, &sect; 38(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the district court's decision ordering the royalties paid to the lessor's successor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After denying defendant's motions to quash and to suppress evidence, the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, convicted defendant of aggravated rape of a known juvenile and indecent behavior with a known juvenile. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor on the rape count and to seven years on the indecent behavior count, to be served consecutively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to support a guilty verdict to the charge of indecent behavior with a juvenile under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81, based merely upon the presence of an infant in the same room while he and his concubine engaged in the videotaped sexual activity. The appellate court disagreed, finding that defendant clearly touched and held his infant daughter in the course of his sexual activity with his girlfriend. The fact that they engaged in sexual activity in the presence of their infant daughter so that the child was in a position to see or sense that sexual acts were taking place formed a sufficient basis to support the conviction. The fact that defendant picked up and held the child while he continued to engage in sexual activity compelled the conclusion that he had the requisite intent to complete the offense. Since the child-victim on the rape charge, the &quot;declarant&quot; in the videotaped interview, testified at trial following the admission of the tape, and was subject to cross-examination, the tape's admission was not a violation of the Confrontation Clause. Defendant's life sentence was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed, and the matter was remanded to the trial court with an order that defendant be informed in writing of both his sex offender registration requirements and his notification requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a city mayor, brought suit against defendants, the city's council members, in the Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana), seeking a judgment declaring a city ordinance invalid and seeking an injunction preventing the council members from acting under the ordinance. The trial court granted a preliminary injunction. The council members made peremptory exceptions, which were denied, and the members sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">City of Alexandria Ordinance 231-2007 allowed the council to enter into contracts for legal services to be provided to the council. The council members argued that the city was a necessary party to the action. The court held that the city council could not sue or be sued. The council was neither a natural person nor a juridical person under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 24. However, the individual members of the council could be sued as natural persons. The injunctive relief sought by the mayor and granted by the trial court was directed to the individual council members and it restrained them from entering into an invalid contract on behalf of the city. The court found that the city was not a necessary party under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 641, because complete relief could be accorded to existing parties, and the city's interest was protected by the inclusion in the suit of representatives of its two branches of government, the mayor and council members. A dismissal would deprive the mayor of his only adequate remedy. Although La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1880 required the city to be a party, the mayor and council members were already parties.</SPAN></P>

The operative date upon which prescription began to run in the current case was April 23, 2004. Her initial complaint was sent via a letter dated March 8, 2005. The Patient's Compensation Fund notified her attorney that filing fees had to be paid within 45 days or the complaint would not suspend the time within which suit must be instituted. The fees were not paid and the patient was advised that her case was no longer considered filed. The invalid request for review of her malpractice claim did not suspend the time within which suit must be instituted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, an employer and its insurer, challenged the judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, granting a peremptory exception raising the objection of prescription on a workers' compensation reimbursement claim in favor of defendant, the Louisiana Workers' Compensation Second Injury Board (Board), as well as a judgment denying the motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On March 8, 2000, the employee was injured during the course and scope of his employment with the employer, and the first weekly compensation benefit was paid on April 20, 2000. On June 19, 2000, a reimbursement claim was filed with the Board, which was approved on February 1, 2001. The Board awarded reimbursement for all weekly indemnity benefits actually paid and payable in excess of the first 104 weeks of payments, provided that proper proof of payment was submitted. On May 11, 2006, the insurer sought reimbursement from the Board for compensation payments made in connection with the March 8, 2000 work accident through March 30, 2006. The Board concluded that the request for compensation benefits paid from March 8, 2002 through May 16, 2005 was untimely under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1378, because the proof of payment was submitted to the Board more than one year after the payments were made and were thus prescribed at the time of the submission to the Board. The appellate court ruled that at the time proof of payment was submitted to the Board, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1378 limited reimbursement to those claims submitted within one year of the date the payment was made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:201 allowed attorney fees to a landowner in an expropriation proceeding instituted by the state or a state agency where the final judgment was that the state or agency could not acquire the property in question. The landowner argued that when the state delegated to the company the authority to expropriate private property under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:2(8), the company became an &quot;agent&quot; of the state. The court disagreed, reasoning that because the types of private entities with the power to expropriate were listed separately in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:2 from the state and its subdivisions, the implication was that these entities were not &quot;agents&quot; or &quot;agencies&quot; of any governmental body. The landowner also argued that La. Const. art. I, &sect; 4, which guaranteed a property owner compensation &quot;to the full extent of his loss,&quot; guaranteed his right to attorney fee reimbursement. However, the court noted that this provision provided attorney fees only to a landowner whose property was &quot;taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The contract granted the company a 5-year exemption under La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 21(F) from industrial ad valorem taxes on an addition to its plant. The assessor stated a cause of action challenging the exemption because he was not estopped from maintaining the action by remaining passive until the contract was executed. The assessor stated a cause of action to direct the state to enable him to place the exempt-property list on the parish assessment rolls because a writ of mandamus was proper under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3863 to compel the state to determine the value of the property. The assessor demonstrated sufficient interest, both in his individual and official capacities, to sustain his. The assessor's suit was timely under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2032. The constitutional question brought the action within the trial court's original jurisdiction. The assessor's allegations about the correctness of the exemption did not have to be reviewed by the state under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1989, et seq. before undergoing judicial review. The assessor failed to  present competent evidence to prevent dismissal of his suit or to supports his summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>

The retailers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retailers argued that the trial court erred in failing to declare the &quot;challenged practices&quot; unconstitutional. The appellate court found that the Commerce Clause basis for the Sherman Act ( Sherman Act), 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1, was narrowed, or &quot;qualified,&quot; by the 21st Amendment. The State had met any procedural burden to raise the 21st Amendment. All six bans were within the core of the State's power to regulate the transportation, distribution, sale, and consumption of alcoholic beverages under the 21st Amendment. By denying market incentives--the price differential across geographic areas--that would give rise to a bootleg market, Louisiana regulators avoided the creation of a bootleg market and distribution system. All of the retailers' Sherman Act claims were subject to dismissal as the bans were restraints imposed unilaterally by government and did not qualify as concerted action. No showing was made that the bas took place in or substantially affected interstate commerce. No discrimination against interstate commerce, and no discrimination in support of economic protectionism, was alleged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sister and appellee siblings filed a petition for possession, a detailed descriptive list, affidavits of death and heirship, and a judgment of possession.

The St. Bernard 34th Judicial District Court (Louisiana) granted summary judgment in favor of the siblings. The sister appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the death of the parties' father, the parties filed a detailed descriptive list that included a credit union account. The judgment of possession placed all the heirs in possession of the property comprising the estate. In the sister's petition to nullify/amend the judgment of possession and to reopen succession, she requested that the account be excluded from the descriptive list and the judgment of possession because it allegedly was erroneously included as an asset of the estate. The appellate court determined that the district court properly found that it was not possible to reopen the succession and amend the judgment of possession under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. arts. 2004 and 3393 because (1) the case did not involve property that was overlooked or omitted from the judgment of possession, (2) &quot;other proper cause&quot; was not judicially recognized to remove assets from the estate, and (3) no allegation of ill practices was made. The statutory requirements of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6:653.1(A) were not met, because the decedent did not submit an affidavit to the credit union declaring that the sister was within the mandatory degree of kinship to be recognized as a beneficiary.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal disagreed. The State presented the testimony of an animal welfare agent who physically examined the dogs, and the testimony of an expert in the field of dogfighting who reviewed photographs of the dogs. Both witnesses testified that several of the forty-three dogs found at defendant's residence had injuries indicative of illegal dogfights. Some of the injuries were old, and some were considered recent. One dog had injuries that were received during a fight that had occurred within the last month. Some dogs had signs of old injuries and scarring. The expert testified that there was no doubt in her mind that several of the dogs had been fought in illegal dogfights. Further, the State presented several items that were seized from defendant's residence that were consistent with dogfighting or training dogs to fight, including two used break sticks, two treadmills, one of which had possible blood splatter on it, a trap used to catch small animals, and voluminous dogfighting memorabilia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, sustained the defendants', State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE), the Louisiana Department of Education, the Recovery School District (RSD), and the Orleans Parish School Board (OPSB), peremptory exception pleading the objection of no cause of action and dismissing plaintiffs', teacher's union and residents, claims with prejudice. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of Act 35 of the First Extraordinary Session of 2005 (Act 35), which was passed by the Louisiana Legislature in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Plaintiffs challenged the ruling sustaining the State defendants' exception raising the objection of no cause of action. The appellate court found that Act 35 did not alter or impair the contractual rights between the union and OPSB as set forth in the collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). The RSD was not obligated to apply those CBAs in the schools it supervised and operated. Act 35 was not passed in an attempt to impact public sector labor relations, and any impact it may have had was secondary and unintentional. It constituted a legitimate exercise of the State's police power to protect the general welfare of its people. While the union may have believed that it would have continued to negotiate with OPSB or the RSD on future CBAs once the current CBAs expired, this expectation was not reasonably based on any statutory, jurisprudential, or contractual authority. The trial court did not err in denying the plaintiffs' motion for leave of court to amend the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of simple possession of cocaine. The trial court found him to be a third offender and sentenced him to life in prison. His sentence was later modified to 10 years in prison as a third offender. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court imposed an excessive sentence. The court found that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1A(2)(b)(ii), the mandatory sentence for his third offender adjudication was life in prison. The trial court more than adequately complied with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 in giving its reasons for sentence. Although defendant was found with only cocaine residue, the trial court imposed the 10-year sentence based on his prior criminal record, which dated back to arrests as early as 1967 and continued through the 1990s, with incarceration for the last prior offense lasting until the mid 1990s. Defendant had prior convictions for possession of an unregistered firearm and second-degree battery. The trial court gave adequate reasons for the sentence, and a comparison of sentences of similar crimes did not show that the 10-year sentence was disproportionate to the crime and defendant's criminal history.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

OCTOBER 22, 2007 MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT THE RECORD IS GRANTED. PORTION OF JUDGMENT DENYING DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS AFFIRMED.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, developers and a parish, challenged a decision of the 21st Judicial District Court, Parish of Tangipahoa (Louisiana), which ruled in favor of appellee city, ordered the developers to present plans at a public hearing before a parish council, denied injunctive relief, denied declaratory judgment, and entered mandamus relief ordering the council to review and revise its ordinances. Motions to supplement the record were before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This case involved a 300-unit apartment complex planned by the developers for construction in an unincorporated area of the parish. The city opposed the development and ultimately the matter went to court. The trial court ordered the developers to obtain approval from the council rather than the planning commission and ordered the parish to review and revise ordinances. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part on appeal. Because Tangipahoa Parish Ordinance Number 07-59 did not actually cure any of the perceived problems raised by the city in this litigation, its passage did not moot this controversy. The planning commission had authority to approve or disapprove subdivision projects, and according to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:101.1, the act of approving or disapproving a subdivision plat was statutorily recognized and defined as a legislative function. Thus, a writ of mandamus under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. arts. 3862, 3863, should not have been issued to compel the parish, the parish council, and/or the planning commission to promulgate new or revised ordinances and procedures affecting the approval process for subdivision projects, which was a purely legislative function.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied one motion to supplement the record, but granted the other one. The court affirmed the judgment insofar as it declined to enter declaratory judgment and denied injunctive relief. The court reversed the judgment insofar as it (1) ordered the developers to submit plans to the council, (2) ordered the council to hold a public hearing, and (3) issued mandamus relief and the related orders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence. The appellate court pretermitted two assignments of error. The supreme court then remanded the case for consideration of these alleged errors. In affirming the conviction and sentence, the appellate court held that there was no error in the denial of defendant's motion to quash the habitual offender bill of information. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 did not unconstitutionally allow sentencing enhancements without a jury determination. The ruling in Apprendi made an exception for prior convictions. Next, the 12-year sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. Due to the fact that defendant was adjudicated a third-felony habitual offender, he was subject to a maximum sentence of 20 years. The trial judge here gave three pages of reason for his sentence; defendant was driving without headlights, drove away at a high rate of speed, he had another conviction involving a vehicle, and he lied while testifying. Based on defendant's age, his criminal history, the circumstances of the offense, and the factors under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, the sentence was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

There was a competency hearing prior to trial and the trial court determined that defendant was competent, he was found competent to represent himself, there was no objection by counsel as to any failure to find him competent to proceed with the multiple offender proceeding, and appellate counsel did not raise this issue, and thus defendant did not show any prejudice. Furthermore, the court had already affirmed findings of defendant's competency in this case and there was no indication that defendant's condition deteriorated post-trial and prior to his multiple billing. The trial court imposed a term of seven and one-half years following defendant's adjudication as a second offender and the maximum the trial court could have imposed was 10 years and the minimum was two and one-half years under La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury for the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Jefferson Parish, Division &quot;B&quot; (Louisiana), found defendant guilty of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated incest of a juvenile under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:42, 14:78.1. He was sentenced to life in prison for the rape and 25 years on each incest count. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently and without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to prove that an aggravated rape occurred. He contended there was no evidence of penetration and maintained the evidence only showed that he licked the victim and touched her, which was insufficient to show penetration. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:42(A)(4) and 14:41(A) and (C), the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of aggravated rape because (1) oral sexual intercourse did not require penetration; and (2) the victim's testimony alone was sufficient to establish the elements of a sexual offense. A life sentence for aggravated rape was mandated by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42(D)(2)(b) unless the State decided to seek the death penalty under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42(D)(2)(a). Defendant did not urge a downward deviation at the time of sentencing. In his motion to reconsider, he simply asserted his sentence was unconstitutionally excessive. At no time did defendant argue or present any evidence showing any exceptional circumstances to justify a downward departure from the mandatory life sentence. Thus, he failed to carry his burden of proof that his life sentence for aggravated rape was unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment, but remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to provide written notification of the general sex offender and child predator registration requirements to defendant, to determine his ability to pay the victim's reasonable costs of counseling that result from the offense based on his financial resources and future ability to pay, and to correct the commitment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parish gave notice to the tax debtor of its intent to sell her property at a tax sale for unpaid taxes. The property was sold. The purchaser of the property brought an action to confirm the tax sale. The tax debtor answered the petition, and filed a reconventional demand to annul the tax sale. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of the purchaser, confirming the tax sale. On appeal, the court found that the tax debtor did not meet her burden of proving that the tax sale was invalid for failure to notify the mortgage holder. There was no proof that the mortgage holder requested notice, as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2180.1(A), and the mortgage holder was not a party to the suit. Further, the notice given was sufficient to meet due process requirements. The sheriff sent a certified letter to the tax debtor, at the correct address. The sheriff's office received the return receipt back from the post office. Although the notice misspelled the tax debtor's name, the return receipt's signature contained the correct spelling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury for the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Jefferson Parish, Division &quot;J&quot; (Louisiana), found defendant guilty of possession of cocaine under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(C). After a hearing, the trial court found that defendant was a fourth felony offender. The trial court then vacated the original sentence and sentenced him to 30 years' imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation or suspension of sentence. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Testimony was presented that after experienced detectives received narcotics complaints defendant was observed in a high-crime, high-drug area in what appeared to be a hand-to-hand narcotics transaction. Upon the approach of the detectives, who were wearing clothing that identified themselves as officers, defendant fled. The experienced officers' observation of an apparent drug deal in a high drug crime area followed by defendant's flight upon the approach of two police officers gave the officers the requisite reasonable suspicion to pursue and detain him under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 215.1 and the Fourth Amendment. Also, the discarded bags of narcotics were properly seized as abandoned property. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the evidence under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 703(D). Further, the trial court noted the pattern of cocaine possession and believed that defendant deserved a stiff sentence. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to 30 years' imprisonment given defendant's criminal history and the sentence was not excessive under the Eighth Amendment or La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, but remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to amend the minutes and commitments to correct discrepancies and to send defendant written notice of the prescriptive period for post-conviction relief applications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff was a nine-year-old passenger in a vehicle that struck a patched area of the roadway, skidded off the highway into a ditch, rolled over to its side, and then struck a number of trees growing near the back of the ditch. Plaintiff sued the DOTD for negligence, alleging failure to properly maintain the road and that the road failed to comply with applicable design standards; as a result, the roadway, shoulders, and recovery zone were allegedly deficient. The jury returned a verdict finding the driver 60% at fault and DOTD 40% at fault. The trial court erred by granting a JNOV for DOTD and amending the judgment to reflect a finding that DOTD was 0% at fault. The Court of Appeal of Louisiana reinstated the jury's verdict. There was conflicting testimony concerning the driver's consumption of alcohol before the accident. However, this did not absolve the DOTD from fault. The presence of a tree 10.52 feet from the edge of the roadway was a significant contributing factor to the collision and plaintiff's injuries. The jury did not abuse its discretion by awarding plaintiff $ 12,650,234.00 in damages. There was no error in the jury instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The JNOV was reversed. The alternative judgment granting a new trial was reversed, and the judgment rendered on the jury verdict for plaintiff was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

The insurer's unconditional payment of the property damage claim was an acknowledgement under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3464 sufficient to interrupt prescription.

Because defendant did not have the right to counsel at a certain pretrial hearing, it was unnecessary to further consider whether defendant was represented, and if not, whether he waived the right to representation. The hearing on the motions to quash was not a critical stage for Sixth Amendment purposes, as the grounds of the motions concerned alleged violations of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 230.1 and 701, and these claims did not concern the time limitation for the institution of prosecution or for the commencement of trial, which were valid grounds for a motion to quash under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 532(7). For purposes of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 841(A), defendant did not object to the admission of crime laboratory reports and thus failed to preserve his right to challenge the evidence post-verdict. Defendant did not raise a speedy trial issue at any time prior to the appeal, and this was rendered moot upon conviction. There were no errors patent found.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for threatening to set the victim's home on fire after a fight with his girlfriend. On appeal, the court held that there was a misjoinder of offenses in the bill of information under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 493 because defendant was entitled to a jury trial for the felony charge and was not entitled to a jury trial on the misdemeanor charge; however, because defendant failed to file a motion to quash the bill of information, he waived any objection to the error. The court severed the misdemeanor conviction from the appeal and ordered defendant to file a writ of review regarding that conviction. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's felony conviction because: (1) defendant's statement to a deputy that he did not mean what he said to the victim and his girlfriend clearly indicated that he knowingly made a false statement; (2) the jury was entitled to conclude that a reasonable person hearing defendant's threat to trap the occupants in the home and burn the home down would have taken the threat seriously; and (3) La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:54.1 did not require that the offense occurred in a public setting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that an acknowledgment of paternity signed in Oklahoma was valid and that the alleged father had timely brought his action to establish paternity.

Code Ann. art. 198 to bar the alleged father's attempt to establish paternity. The alleged father filed his petition for custody within the two-year period under the old law and five days before the new law became effective. He acknowledged paternity in writing and lived with the child and the mother for three years. The court found that the Oklahoma acknowledgment was valid. The retroactive application of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 198 would have unconstitutionally stripped the alleged father of a vested right to establish paternity under the circumstances of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant corporation filed a defamation suit against appellees, the Louisiana State Inspector General (IG), among others, based on reports prepared and published by the IG regarding the corporation's attempt to obtain a brand name contract. The denial of the State's special motion to strike was reversed. On remand, the Civil District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, awarded the IG attorney's fees and costs. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the corporation raised several issues challenging the award of attorney fees. The appellate court found that the corporation was given an opportunity to refute the IG's findings of fact and opinions in the draft report before the final report was published on the IG's website. Although the IG may have arrived at some derogatory opinions, the facts on which those opinions were based were not defamatory; they simply were the facts as discovered by his office. The appellate court found no evidence of malice, actual or implied, on the part of the IG. Thus, there was no reason not to apply the law of the case doctrine. Further, La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 971B mandated an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs. The appellate court was allowed, and even required, to determine if the amount awarded was reasonable, thereby considering whether &quot;mitigating factors&quot; were applicable. The IG could recover only those fees associated with the motion to strike. The appellate court found the award was excessive, and the evidence submitted by the IG supporting the attorney's fees and costs was completely inadequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and the matter was remanded to the trial court for a determination of attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to grant her motion to suppress evidence because there were no exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless entry into the home. The court of appeal agreed. The officers could not see into the residence because of the texture of the glass. The officers could only see the forms of individuals moving back and forth in what was described as panicked movements. Based on the totality of the actual information available to them at that time, law enforcement officers could not reasonably have concluded that the reason for the movement was the destruction of evidence or arming of the occupants. Because the officers lacked probable cause to believe that the destruction of evidence was imminent, or their safety was at risk, there were no exigent circumstances that justified the forced entry into the residence. Any evidence discovered by law enforcement as a result of the warrantless entry, therefore, could not be considered in determining whether there was probable cause for a search warrant to be issued and could not be admitted into evidence under the plain view doctrine.</SPAN></P>

On each of those occasions, the robber stood directly in front of the clerk and a brief conversation took place. The clerk stated that the perpetrator did not have anything covering his face and was not wearing sunglasses or a hat.

The detective testified that after defendant confessed to the robbery, he prepared a photographic lineup with the defendant's picture and showed it to the clerk.

The trial court also erred by granting the DOTD summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact remained regarding whether the rope swing positioned over shallow water posed an unreasonable risk of injury, as the DOTD's maintenance supervisor testified that, at the time of the accident, no measures had been taken to control access to the swimming hole. Questions also existed as to whether the DOTD's inspections of its rights-of-way should have including the swimming area and revealed any potential defects, including the rope swing positioned over shallow water.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court found that the legislature did not enact La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 971 to bar parties seeking redress for violations of their First Amendment rights by the State, and others acting in concert with the State, from filing legitimate civil rights suits. The counselor's complaint attacked the Board's authority on the behest of the expert and under color of state law to sanction him for commenting on the substandard quality of the expert's services. By imposing sanctions under La. Admin. Code tit. 46, &sect; LXXXVI.1604, Canon 4(A)(7), the Board not only impeded the free flow of information but imposed a code of silence among professional counselors to the detriment of injured employees. The Board's sweeping ban which covered all speech which the Board may define as &quot;disparaging&quot; was not narrowly tailored to avoid unnecessarily circumscribing protected expression. It did not serve a compelling state interest. The counselor's petition contained facts sufficient to show he may be successful in asserting a claim against the expert and the Board for violating his First Amendment right. The counselor had to amend his pleadings to particularize his claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment dismissing the counselor's claims against the expert was reversed and remanded to allow the counselor to amend his pleadings; the judgment dismissing the Board on an exception of venue was reversed.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to 35 years in prison at hard labor and 10 years in prison at hard labor, respectively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised various issues, but the court affirmed. It was clear from the recitation of the facts presented by the State that defendant was admitting to conduct that was adequate to support the convictions. The State's recitation of facts was more properly categorized as imprecise than inadequate, and the conduct admitted to by defendant supported the convictions, although the facts were not accurate as to the victim named in the bill of information that initiated the proceeding in which the plea was obtained. Nothing established a lack of awareness as to the nature of the offense. At best, the record established that the trial court failed to inform defendant of the nature of the charges in violation of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 556.1 and that the trial court failed to inquire into whether counsel explained the offenses to him. The court could not conclude that noncompliance with Article 556.1 warranted setting aside the plea. By not filing a motion for reconsideration of sentence under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.1(A)(2), defendant was limited to review on the question of excessiveness under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. Defendant's sentences were not excessive.</SPAN></P>

The Criminal District Court Orleans Parish, Louisiana, set aside defendant's original sentence and sentenced defendant to twenty years at hard labor without benefit of probation or parole, with credit for time served.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the trial court erred when it imposed the sentence to be served without benefit of parole because La.

The court did not need to take action to correct the trial court's failure to specify that defendant's sentence be served without benefit of suspension of sentence because the correction was statutorily effected. Defendant argued that the trial court should have granted his motion for mistrial when an officer testified that he found a zip-lock bag of green vegetable matter during the search incident to arrest. The trial court did not err when it denied defendant's request for a mistrial, under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 771, because the discovery of the marijuana was part of the res gestae, and the officer's testimony was used to establish the facts leading up to, and including, defendant's arrest. The sentence was not excessive because defendant was adjudicated a fourth felony offender, he was sentenced to the minimum sentence under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(c)(i), and defendant did not produce any evidence to rebut the presumption of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed a judgment of the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, State of Louisiana, convicting them of looting during a declared state of emergency in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62.5(C) and sentencing them to 15 years at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted for taking beer and wine from a grocery store in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. On appeal the court held that &sect; 14:62.5(C) did not violate the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers because the governor's ability to declare a state of emergency as referenced in &sect; 14:62.5(C) had a clearly stated legislative policy in the Louisiana Homeland Security and Emergency Assistance and Disaster Act (HSEDA), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 29:721 et seq., and the standards and limits surrounding the governor and parish president's ability to declare a state of emergency in accordance with the legislative will was sufficiently set forth in the HSEDA. One defendant's sentence was vacated because the trial court did not rule on her motion for post-verdict judgment of acquittal before sentencing as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 821. The court held that defendants' maximum 15-year sentences were excessive because they were not the most egregious offenders of the crime of looting, as all defendants were first-time offenders, two were employed at the time of trial, and they did not attempt to run from the police officer and were compliant with his requests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants' convictions were affirmed, but their sentences were vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:996.10, the payment of expenses of the court and/or the judges was permissive, as it provided that the judicial expense fund &quot;may be used&quot; for any purpose or purposes connected with, incidental to or related to the proper administration or function of the said court or the offices of the individual judges.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a juvenile delinquency case, the Seventh Judicial District Court, Parish of Concordia (Louisiana), adjudicated defendant juvenile a delinquent child pursuant to an adjudication hearing on the offense of oral sexual battery. At the dispositional hearing, the trial court committed defendant to the custody of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, Office of Youth Development, for a period of four years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim stated that defendant placed his sexual organ in her mouth. There was no indication in the record that defendant had notice that the uncertified medical records of another victim from a separate case were going to be introduced. Thus, defendant had no responsibility to subpoena the doctor who treated that victim. Also, the doctor did not live in Louisiana and refused to honor her subpoena and testify. Neither the State nor defendant could enforce an apparent out-of-state subpoena. Based on those facts, defendant's statutory and constitutional rights to confrontation were violated. Thus, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3714(A), the trial court erred by allowing the medical records to be admitted into evidence. Furthermore, the error was not harmless because the medical records provided the only physical evidence in a case contingent upon credibility, and the trial court specifically relied on those medical records in its oral reasons for judgment. Finally, pursuant to La. Code Evid. Ann. arts. 803(4), (6), and 804(A), (B)(5), the medical records were not admissible under the medical treatment, business records, or initial complaint exceptions to the hearsay rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court reversed and vacated the trial court's delinquency adjudication and disposition in the juvenile case and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision not to order a presentence investigation, especially when none was requested, and there was no reason why the trial court should have taken evidence that defendant's many offenses were non-violent property crimes. The trial court in no way prohibited defendant from making any argument in favor of a downward departure and gave no indication that the trial court would not have allowed evidence to be presented in favor of any such argument. Also, the only factor argued by defendant, aside perhaps from his age, was the non-violent nature of his prior crimes, a factor that prior precedent rejected as a sole basis for rebutting the presumption of constitutionality necessary for departing from the minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, along with her son, was charged with illegal possession of stolen things having a value greater than $ 500. A jury found the son not guilty and defendant guilty. She was sentenced to three years imprisonment at hard labor. The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction and sentence, stating that a rational trier of fact could not have concluded that the evidence as admitted excluded a reasonable hypothesis that defendant had no knowledge that the vehicles she purchased after Hurricane Katrina were stolen. While defendant did pay a reduced price for the vehicles, uncontroverted trial testimony established that at the time of purchase, both vehicles had damage that would have lowered their prices, including water damage to one of the vehicles. The evidence further suggested that the disparity between the estimated value of the vehicles when defendant first saw them (already damaged) right around the time of the hurricane and the price she paid for them was not so great that it should have been readily apparent to an unsophisticated buyer such as herself. Defendant also testified that when she purchased the vehicles, it never crossed her mind that they were stolen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a client, sued defendants, her attorneys, their law firm, and their liability insurer, alleging four specific instances of legal malpractice. The Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), dismissed the legal malpractice claims on the basis of peremption, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 9:5606, and granted summary judgment in favor of defendant, upholding the constitutionality of &sect; 9:5605. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court agreed with plaintiff that the trial court erred by dismissing her petition as perempted. The petition was filed within a year of the third and fourth alleged incidents of malpractice, and, on the face of the petition, those claims were timely filed within the terms of the statute. Moreover, the trial court's reliance upon the continuing representation principle to support the dismissal of those claims was legal error. Each separate act of malpractice had to be considered to be a separate cause of action with its own one-year and three-year peremptive period. Having thus determined that two claims were not perempted from the face of the petition, the court next decided if the trial court erred by dismissing her other two claims that occurred more than one but less than three years prior to the date she filed suit. As to both claims, the court found that plaintiff could not have reasonably been expected to have known at the time of the incidents that malpractice had occurred. Plaintiff's suit, which was filed within a year of her consultation with the new attorney and within three years of the incidents, was timely with respect to her other two claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment granting the exception of peremption and dismissing plaintiff's suit, and the court remanded the matter to that court for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient filed a medical malpractice action against the physician and a hospital. The physician sought to enforce the requirement of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.47(I)(2)(c) that the plaintiff in a medical malpractice suit post a cash or surety bond. The patient's attorney alleged that the patient was indigent and unable to post a cash or surety bond. The trial court granted the patient 30 days to post a cash or surety bond and stated that the patient's failure to comply with the order would result in dismissal of his claims against the physician. When the patient failed to timely post a cash or surety bond, the trial court dismissed the action against the physician. The trial court denied the patient's motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court found no error in the trial court's dismissal of the action against the physician. The patient did not post a bond and did not seek permission to proceed as a pauper by the deadline, although his counsel notarized the affidavits required by La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 5183.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury for the Thirty-Sixth Judicial District Court, Parish of Beauregard (Louisiana), found defendant guilty of distribution of cocaine under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967. The State filed a habitual offender bill, and the trial court conducted a hearing, finding defendant to be a fourth offender. The trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment. The trial court denied his motion to reconsider the sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that his life sentence was excessive. The trial court found that defendant was a fourth habitual offender; thus, a life sentence was mandated by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1A(1)(c)(ii). In order to rebut the presumption that the mandatory minimum sentence of life was constitutional, defendant had to clearly and convincingly show that he was exceptional. However, defendant failed to show that he was exceptional. Defendant testified at the habitual offender hearing, but he focused on claiming that he was innocent of the underlying offense. At the end of his testimony, he admitted being a drug user, and claimed to be an addict, but denied having sold drugs since 1993. The appellate court found defendant's unsupported claim that he was merely a drug user, rather than a drug distributor, was negated by his most recent conviction. Also, defendant's bare claim that he was a nonviolent addict would not render the mandatory minimum sentence of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 excessive because a nonviolent criminal history could not be the major reason for a downward deviation. Thus, defendant's life sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction. The appellate court also amended his sentence to delete the trial court's statements regarding diminution eligibility. Finally, the appellate court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to make an entry in the minutes reflecting the appellate court's amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the sexual acts occurred in Caddo Parish or that the victim was under age thirteen. The court of appeal disagreed. The State raised in its pre-trial motion defendant's Bossier Parish sexual misconduct as allowable other crimes evidence. If that same evidence of defendant's Bossier Parish actions with the victim represented the only evidence of aggravated rape, making prosecution in Caddo Parish improper, defendant was obliged to raise venue through the pre-trial motion to quash. No special jury instruction was therefore required because the substance of defendant's arguments related to venue. Moreover, the victim testified that defendant molested her in Shreveport while he was moving into the apartment. Defendant leased the apartment on September 9, 2004. The evidence adduced at trial clearly showed that the baby was born on June 29, 2005. Conception occurred between August 25, 2004 and October 6, 2004, in advance of the victim's thirteenth birthday. Therefore, it was clear that defendant's sexual misconduct with the victim occurred in Caddo Parish before she turned 13.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a decision from the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, which convicted him of looting under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with looting when he was observed taking furniture from a store after a hurricane struck the state. He entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to 14 years in prison. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62.5(A) was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided adequate notice of the proscribed conduct and its consequences to persons of reasonable intelligence. The phrase &quot;normal security&quot; in &sect; 14:62.5(A) prohibited the unauthorized entry into a home, place of business, or other structure and the removal of property when the home, business, or structure was compromised by reason of a hurricane, other forces of nature, or civil unrest. After defendant admitted that he was a second felony offender, his underlying sentence was vacated, and he was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Due to the fact that a plea agreement was entered, defendant was precluded from raising an appellate argument based on the alleged excessiveness of the sentence under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.2(A)(2). Finally, it was noted that defendant might have received an improper indeterminate sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction was affirmed, but the case was remanded to the district court for clarification of defendant's sentence upon resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of distributing cocaine. On remand, the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Ouachita (Louisiana) sentenced defendant as a fourth felony offender to 30 years at hard labor without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence, the first two years of which was to be served without benefit of parole. Defendant sought review of his sentence for excessiveness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(c)(i), the trial court had imposed the mandatory minimum sentence on defendant where the State had presented evidence that he was a fourth felony offender. In sentencing defendant, the trial court was cognizant of the sentencing considerations of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 as it had noted his limited education, his age, his young children, and his role in the cocaine distribution. However, there was no justification for a sentence less than the mandatory minimum where defendant had presented no evidence that his circumstances were exceptional or that he was the victim of the legislature's failure to assign sentences meaningfully tailored to his culpability, the gravity of his offense, or the circumstances of his case. Because defendant had not shown that his case was exceptional and warranted a rare departure from the mandatory minimum sentence under the Habitual Offender Law, the trial court properly sentenced defendant within the statutory range prescribed for a fourth offender under the Habitual Offender Law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged by bill of information with DWI 4th, contrary to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98(E). The Eleventh Judicial District Court for the Parish of DeSoto, Louisiana,, without objection from either side, charged the jury that six possible verdicts were available to them. The jury returned with a verdict of attempted DWI 4th. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The possible six verdicts that were available to the jury were: (1) Guilty of DWI 4th; (2) Guilty of Attempted DWI 4th; (3) Guilty of DWI 3rd; (4) Guilty of DWI 2nd; (5) Guilty of DWI; and (6) Not guilty. The issue on appeal was whether attempted DWI was a crime. The appellate court believed that it was. The appellate court noted that the record was crystal-clear that defendant committed the crime of DWI 4th offense. The appellate court concluded that it was no moment that attempted DWI required the additional harmonization of the attempt statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:27, with DWI, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98. No objection was made at trial to the proposed charge, which arguably waived any objection on appeal. The jury cut defendant a huge break with an obvious compromise verdict. The appellate court concluded that just because the verdict was unusual and undeserved, however, did not mean that the verdict was illegal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee filed a disputed claim for workers' compensation alleging that he was injured while in the course and scope of his employment with the employer. The employee filed an amended disputed claim adding the fund. The fund responded by filing a petition for declaratory judgment, in which it alleged that at the time of his accidents, the employee was not employed with the employer. As such, the fund asserted that the workers' compensation agreement between it and the employer did not provide coverage. Prior to trial, a settlement agreement was reached in which the fund paid the employee $ 10,000 and he released all parties. The fund reserved its right to assert its coverage issue. Before the submission of any evidence, the workers' compensation judge held that since this was an allegation of insurance fraud, subject matter jurisdiction was lacking. The appellate court ruled that the workers' compensation judge erred in finding that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking. The settlement of the employee's claim did not divest the Office of Workers' Compensation of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat.

The judge brought an action against defendants, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 13:587. The trial court denied relief to the judge. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 13:587 did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of the legislature's exclusive authority to establish courts of limited jurisdiction.

Moreover, the screened-in porch was an inhabited dwelling because the placement of the roof of the porch was not dispositive of whether the porch was part of the house and there was evidence that the porch was completely screened, the outside door leading to the porch was locked, and there were doors on the porch leading inside the house.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:469. The Nineteenth Judicial District Court In and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, denied plaintiffs' preliminary injunction request. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the qualifying period for the office of sheriff closed, the incumbent died before the election. Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:469, the qualifying period for the primary election was reopened for three days and additional candidates qualified. Plaintiffs alleged that &sect; 18:469 violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Louisiana Constitution, La. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 2 and 3, based on the additional monies that would have to be spent. The appellate court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a preliminary injunction because plaintiffs failed to establish a prima facie case that they would prevail on the merits on their constitutional challenges since, inter alia, (1) La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:469 served a legitimate government purpose of promoting candidacy, (2) regarding the prospective candidate's claims involving time requirements, he did not challenge the relevant statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:465, and (3) taxpayers' financial burden did not justify injunctive relief. The trial court did not err in failing to consider the declaratory judgment request, but the request was entitled to expedited treatment on remand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant police department challenged a decision from the New Orleans, Louisiana, Civil Service Commission (CSC), which determined that the discipline imposed against appellee police officers was illegal due to the lack of a pre-termination hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officers had abandoned their posts or failed to report for duty after a hurricane struck. The officers contended that the failure to conduct a pre-termination hearing constituted a violation of due process under the United States Constitution and La. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;2. The CSC determined that the discipline imposed upon the officers was illegal, and this appeal followed. In vacating the decision of the CSC, the appellate court held that due process required an opportunity for a hearing before the deprivation of a significant property interest. The officers had a property interest in employment because they had received the position, and they were guaranteed to continued employment unless certain exceptions applied. However, there were situations where a postdeprivation hearing was enough to satisfy due process requirements. Due process had a flexible standard that called for such procedural protections as the particular situation demanded. The emergency situation in the city after the hurricane constituted an extraordinary or truly unusual situation. The voiding of the disciplinary action in this case would have had a negative impact on those that remained at their posts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decision from the CSC was vacated. The cases were remanded for the receipt of additional evidence as necessary to resolve the cases and render a judgment on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff drainage district sued defendant landowner, seeking a declaratory judgment regarding access to a drainage ditch. The Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Vermilion, Louisiana, rendered judgment in favor of the drainage district, cast the landowner with the costs associated with an expert witness fee, and denied the landowner compensation for the drainage district's use of the legal servitude. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner denied the drainage district access to a drainage ditch which formed the northern boundary line of the landowner's property. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 38:113, 38:1764, and 38:1804, the appellate court determined that the trial court properly found that the drainage ditch was a natural drain and that the drainage district had the authority to clean and maintain the ditch because the evidence in the record clearly established that the drainage ditch was a natural drain which formed part of the natural drainage scheme in the geographical area which had been in existence for decades. Under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1920, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in assessing the costs of court against the landowner, including the expert witness fee, because the drainage district prevailed in its declaratory judgment suit. Finally, the trial court did not err in failing to award the landowner compensation for the drainage district's use of a construction servitude, because the record was void of any evidence to support the allegation that the landowner was damaged, or the amount of any damages alleged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers sought review of an order from the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which awarded summary judgment to defendants, a city, United Governmental Services of Louisiana, and law firms, and held that New Orleans, La., Ordinance No. 18637 was constitutional in an action challenging the assessment of penalties, interest, and attorney fees in connection with the collection of taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers did not pay their property taxes timely. Once the taxes were paid, the taxpayers received notice that they each owed additional penalties, interest, and attorney fees for making the late tax payments. The taxpayers brought a suit against defendants, challenging the assessment of the penalties, interest, and attorney fees. The taxpayers asked for partial summary judgment declaring Ordinance 18637 unconstitutional. Defendants asked for summary judgment declaring the ordinance constitutional. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court found that Ordinance 18637 violated La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 25 in that it allowed the taxing unit or its authorized agent to file suit to collect the delinquent tax, and to recover costs and attorney fees. The offending portions of Ordinance  18637 were so interrelated with the remainder of the ordinance that they could not be severed. While the city's home rule charter granted it the right &quot;to lay and collect taxes,&quot; the 30 percent penalty assessed against the taxpayers was actually a legal fee disguised as a penalty. The assessment of attorney fees was inconsistent with La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court judgment upholding the constitutionality of Ordinance 18637. The court declared Ordinance 18637 unconstitutional. The court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, convicting him, in three consolidated cases, of illegal use of a weapon during a crime of violence, three counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, possession with intent to distribute a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance (CDS), and illegal carrying of weapons while in possession of a CDS.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of possession of a CDS and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon because the police officer's testimony established that the contraband was inside the vehicle with defendant and therefore was within his dominion and control. There was sufficient evidence of defendant's intent to distribute the contraband because, given that the officer found $ 2,696 in defendant's pocket, 19.75 grams of powder cocaine in the vehicle's glove compartment, a gram of marijuana in the ashtray, and a loaded firearm and digital scales in the vehicle, there was no reasonable hypothesis that the possession of the cocaine was for personal use. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon because the State presented evidence that defendant pleaded guilty to armed robbery in 1994 and a police officer testified that defendant's fingerprints taken in open court matched the fingerprints on the back of the bill of information for the armed robbery charge. The trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with second degree murder; however, a jury for the Thirty-Ninth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Red River (Louisiana) found defendant guilty of the responsive verdict of manslaughter under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">There was no reasonable hypothesis that defendant acted in self-defense because (1) he testified at trial that he initiated the confrontation with the victim; (2) the testimony revealed that he believed the victim had previously engaged in inappropriate behavior with his daughter, which provided defendant with motive for the murder but did not support his claim of self-defense; (3) defendant's story at trial that he allowed the victim to come within arms-length while wielding a machete was simply not logical; (4) the State presented testimony that there were no signs of a physical struggle at the site of the alleged confrontation and shooting; (5) defendant admitted that for over a week he lied to both his mother and the police about the victim's disappearance, which was evidence of consciousness of guilt, not self-defense; (6) the State presented much evidence of concealment, which tended to prove guilty knowledge and cut against a claim of self-defense; and (7) defendant's version of the killing at trial was contradictory in significant respects to his prior statements to police.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, convicting him of armed robbery (among other counts), and adjudicating him to be a second felony offender and sentencing him to 80 years hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence, with the sentence to run concurrently with defendant's other sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On remand, defendant was adjudicated a second felony offender and was sentenced to 80 years hard labor for armed robbery. Defendant asserted that there was a complete lack of aggravating factors warranting the 80-year sentence and that the trial court did not consider all factors in making its sentencing determination. Defendant argued that the sentence imposed, even though it was admittedly within the statutory parameters of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15.529.1, was not particularized to fit both the offender and the offense. The appellate court ruled that defendant's sentence was not so disproportionate to the seriousness of the offense as to shock one's sense of justice. The minimum sentence for armed robbery for a second felony habitual offender was 49 1/2 years' imprisonment at hard labor, and the maximum sentence was 198 years under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:529.1 and 14:64. Defendant committed four crimes of violence against three different city employees while they were on duty, including shooting one of the victims in the back of the head simply because he said he did not have any money. Defendant had a prior criminal history, including crimes of violence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana) of looting following Hurricane Katrina. Defendant was sentenced to serve five years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. The court of appeal disagreed. A detective was &quot;absolutely positive&quot; that the three individuals he saw looting were the same three who ran and were subsequently apprehended and identified as defendant and his accomplices. Another detective testified that he removed the merchandise from the garbage can used to transport the stolen items. He counted them, and recorded the items and amounts on a note pad he carried with him. Those notes were offered into evidence and were contained in the record. He also photographed the items, although in preparation for trial, only the photos from the first arrest could be located. The detective also explained that the vast amounts of merchandise collected that day from looters, and lack of manpower, prevented the items from being taken to police headquarters and processed. The testimony of police officers faced with snipers, citizens in dire need, and numerous looters, was clear, consistent, and positive regarding the identity of the looters, and the exact items looted. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction was affirmed. The sentence was vacated and the matter was remanded to the trial court for re-sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The record established that in 2001, the candidate was convicted of two felony counts of attempted extortion.

Also, the candidate asserted that as a first offender, he was entitled to an automatic pardon upon completion of his sentence, pursuant to La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(E)(1). The appellate court ruled that the automatic pardon provision under La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(E)(1) did not restore the candidate's right to hold public office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a senator resigned during a term, the candidate was elected to fill the vacancy. He was subsequently elected to serve second and third consecutive terms of office. When he announced an intention to run for a fourth time, the objectors filed a petition, which stated that the candidate was ineligible to do so. The petition was dismissed, and this appeal followed. In reversing, the appellate court determined that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case because La. Const. art. III, &sect; 7(A) had no bearing on its authority to challenge a candidate's qualifications. In fact, the trial court had jurisdiction under La. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(A) and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1403. Next, the term limits for the candidate were set out in La. Const. art. III, &sect;&nbsp;4(E). Because the candidate had served for more than two and one-half terms in three consecutive terms, he was prohibited by law from being a candidate here. To the extent that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:601 was interpreted in derogation of the clear language of the Louisiana Constitution, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decision was reversed, and judgment was entered in favor of the objectors.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal disagreed. The circumstances indicated that defendant was aware that he was in possession of a controlled dangerous substance. At the time the Xanax pills were found, defendant was in a vehicle with a person under investigation for narcotics distribution through a neighborhood known as a high-crime area with narcotics traffic. Both officers testified that defendant admitted the pills were his and stated that he got them from a friend for his mouth pain. They further testified that defendant had a crack pipe when he was searched and that he originally agreed to assist them in narcotics investigations to avoid arrest. When defendant was arrested two weeks later, he stated that he traded a rock of crack cocaine to people in exchange for the pills, which he believed to be pain medication for his mouth. Given defendant's statement that he traded a rock of crack cocaine for the pills that he believed were pain medication, the evidence was sufficient from which a rational fact finder could have determined that defendant knew the pills were a controlled dangerous substance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) of molestation of a juvenile.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. The court of appeal disagreed. Defendant testified that he was born August 31, 1979, and the victim was between the ages of six and seven years old when these incidents of sexual abuse occurred; thus, the State presented sufficient evidence to show that defendant was over the age of seventeen, that the victim was under the age of seventeen and that the age difference was more than two years. The testimony of the child from the video described many lewd and lascivious acts committed upon her by defendant. The child testified that defendant threatened to kill her if she told. That constituted evidence that defendant committed the acts through a threat of great bodily harm. Further, defendant lived with the child, the child called defendant &quot;daddy,&quot; and defendant committed many of the lewd and lascivious acts while the child was in his care. Those facts supported the conclusion that defendant accomplished the acts by use of influence by virtue of being in a position of control or supervision over the child. Accordingly, the State presented sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury for the 19th Judicial District Court In and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) found defendant guilty of Medicaid fraud, theft, and money laundering under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;14:70.1, 14:67, and 14:230. He was adjudged a second-felony habitual offender and sentenced to 50 years at hard labor. Defendant appealed his convictions and his habitual-offender sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions for Medicaid fraud and money laundering did not violate the double jeopardy prohibition in the Fifth Amendment or La. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 because the evidence required to support the finding of guilt of Medicaid fraud (the fraudulent billing) did not also support the conviction for money laundering (concealing or disguising the nature or source of proceeds derived from the Medicaid fraud). However, the evidence required to support the finding of guilt of theft - the taking of money (proceeds derived from Medicaid fraud) by means of fraudulent conduct, practices, or representations (the fraudulent billing) - did involve the same evidence required to support the Medicaid fraud convictions and the money laundering conviction. Thus, defendant's theft conviction violated double jeopardy. However, the evidence was sufficient to convict him of Medicaid fraud and money laundering. Furthermore, his habitual-offender sentence was proper because he had previously been convicted of a felony. Finally, the sentence imposed on him was not grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offense; thus, it was not unconstitutionally excessive under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences for Medicaid fraud, vacated defendant's conviction and sentence for theft, and affirmed defendant's conviction, habitual-offender adjudication, and sentence for money laundering.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers sued defendant political subdivisions, alleging that ordinances that rededicated a certain percentage of sales and use taxes for debt service on bonds issued to finance a retail outlet were unconstitutional and contravened statutory authority. Plaintiffs appealed a decision of the 21st Judicial District Court Parish of Livingston, Louisiana, dismissing their consolidated challenges. Defendants moved to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Supreme Court of Louisiana had held that the failure to challenge the bond resolution within 30 days of its publication barred all challenges to the bonds, their security, and the means of payment, but it had pretermitted consideration of the appellate court's ruling that timely filed challenges to the legality of the elections were not barred by La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33:9038.34(L). The Supreme Court's pretermitting discussion was not an approval of the appellate court's ruling. Reconsideration of the previously raised issues was appropriate as the appellate court had previously declined to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction and it had to consider the Supreme Court's decision in the bond validation suit. Since plaintiffs' claims did not challenge the election, La. Const. art. VI. &sect; 35(A) did not apply. The Supreme Court's decision in the bond validation suit was conclusive as to the validity of the bonds, the tax, the pledge of revenues, and any other provisions of the bonds; it had clearly stated that plaintiffs had failed to timely exercise the right to contest the bond resolution and its security provisions. Thus, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The motion to dismiss the appeal was granted. Each party to the appeal was to bear its own costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the 32nd Judicial District Court, Parish of Terrebonne (Louisiana), which convicted him of simple kidnapping in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of simple kidnapping and was found to have been a third-felony habitual offender; he was sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor for seven years. He appealed after his motion for reconsideration of sentence was denied. The appellate court affirmed however, stating that the evidence was sufficient. The victim testified that defendant placed the knife to her throat and forced her from the kitchen to the bathroom, to the yard, and from the yard to her own residence. The victim further testified that defendant continued to hold the knife to her throat and threatened to &quot;blues&quot; her, which the victim testified meant that defendant would do anything possible to her. And, while the prior inconsistent statements of two witnesses in the case were admissible to attack credibility under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 607(D)(2), such nonhearsay statements were also admissible for their assertive value as well. Defendant was exposed to a maximum sentence of 10 years for his conviction under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:45(B) and 15:529.1(A)(1)(b)(i), and he was sentenced to 7 years. It was clear that the sentence imposed was well within the statutory limits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The original leases contained reversionary clauses under which improvements such as boathouses vested in the District when the leases expired. To avoid reversion, various lessees negotiated lease options at different times, resulting in some lessees obtaining a more favorable future rental rate than the suing lessees. The trial court held that the suing lessees' lease options were void for failure to specify the rental amount as required by La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2668. On appeal, the court agreed. A decision in a separate but related case upholding the validity of the more favorable lease options was inapplicable, as those leases did specify a rental rate. The suing lessees' equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3, were not violated because the first lessees to accept the option offer were legitimately treated differently from the suing lessees, as the earlier leases contained statutory or constitutional infirmities. The reversionary provision did not result in a taking without just compensation under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 4(B)(1) because the lessees received the bargained-for benefit of using the boathouses for the lease period.</SPAN></P>

The State noted that defendant left a trail of evidence that a canine unit followed that brought police to his doorstep within a short period of time following the shooting, where he was arrested with his co-defendants. The court further held that defendant did not allege or prove any specific grievous errors of trial counsel. The court held that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt the free and voluntary nature of defendant's two statements to police and that he knowingly and intelligently waived his Miranda rights. The first statement, made while defendant was being treated in the hospital, was clearly non-custodial. The court held that the senselessness, danger, and reprehensible nature of defendant's crime clearly justified his 50-year sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a decision from the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier, Louisiana, which denied her motion to suppress evidence in a driving while impaired (DWI) case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was stopped for speeding on a parish road by a state trooper. Her actions were in violation of a parish ordinance, but she was operating at less than the presumptive state highway speed limit established by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:61. She was arrested for DWI after the trooper noticed signs of impairment. Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 703, which argued that the initial stop was illegal. This was based on the fact that the speeding charge was quashed due to the lack of violation under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 32:61-64. The motion was denied, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court found that the trooper's actions here were objectively reasonable due to the fact that defendant was traveling over the posted speed limit. Moreover, suppression of the trooper's observations of impairment immediately after the stop would not have satisfied a rational societal objective. Finally, it was unnecessary to the validity of the stop to determine the powers of the trooper to enforce local government traffic laws, although the appellate court noted that they had such powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decision was affirmed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee, the food director at a state penitentiary, fell and injured his back while on a loading dock directing a supply truck. On appeal, the court held that there was no showing that the employee made any wilful misrepresentation or false statement in order to obtain workers' compensation benefits in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208(G) because the employee stated that he had told his supervisors that he owned a tire business, that he never paid himself a salary, that the business operated at a loss, and therefore the employee did not believe that he had any earnings to report. The workers' compensation judge's (WCJ) determination that the employee's testimony was credible and its finding that accident occurred on January 20, 1997 was reasonably supported by the record. The record also provided reasonable support for the WCJ's finding that a causal connection between the accident and the disabling condition was shown. The provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1221(3)(d)(iii) were inapplicable because there was no evidence of the employee's intention to permanently withdraw from the work force, given his self-employment in his used tire business.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal disagreed. Defendant was discovered in a back corner area of the business, lying between two rafters with a plywood board on top of him. After defendant followed the officer's verbal commands, he was placed under arrest. Defendant was led down from the attic space whereupon the owner informed the arresting officers that defendant was not an employee nor did he have permission to be inside the building. The owner testified that defendant did not have permission to be inside the business and he further testified that there were valuable pieces of equipment inside the building, including hand tools, power tools, computers, and small electrical equipment that could easily have been picked up and carried out. The owner testified that after the burglary, he noticed that two tires had been removed from inside the building and that the tires would have had to have been removed for defendant to gain entry into the building.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) of three counts of molestation of a juvenile. He was adjudicated a third felony habitual offender on the first count and sentenced to 30 years on count one and 15 years on counts two and three, imposed consecutively and without benefits. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in imposing unconstitutionally excessive sentences, particularly by ordering that the sentences be served consecutively. The court of appeal disagreed. The record indicated that defendant knew he had a problem, yet he continued to molest the children on numerous occasions over a span of years, and the abuse started when the children were very young. The consecutive sentences imposed were justified by the record, and accordingly, there was no abuse of the trial court's discretion in imposing the consecutive sentences. Additionally, the trial court did not err in allowing hearsay evidence to impermissibly bolster the victims' testimony and ease the State's burden of proof. The officer's testimony was not hearsay because the declarants actually testified at the trial, were subject to cross-examination, and the evidence was offered to rebut a defense challenge to the implication that the victims' testimony contained exaggerated descriptions of events in order to bolster the State's case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parts of defendant's sentences that imposed a sentence without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence were deleted. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), entered judgment for plaintiff property owners in an action against defendant oil company awarding them $ 56 million in compensatory and general damages and $ 1 billion in punitive damages. The court affirmed and reduced the punitive damages. The United State Supreme Court granted the oil company's petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners sued the oil company to recover damages for the contamination of a 33-acre tract of land with radioactive material. Between 1968 and 1992, an oil field service company had leased the land from the owners for its business operations, which included the cleaning, inspecting, testing, threading, transporting, and storage of oil well tubulars for the oil company and others. The Court remanded the case for further consideration in light of its decision in the Phillip Morris case. On review, the court held that the jury instructions concerning punitive damages were constitutional under the due process clause because the trial court set forth a correct statement of the law and none of the factors included in the instructions, including reprehensibility, punishment, deterrence, harm to the owners, and the oil company's financial condition, were objectionable or prohibited. The record contained sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the oil company had engaged in wanton and reckless conduct supporting a punitive damage award. However, the court held that the $ 1 billion award was excessive, and reduced it to $ 112 million, twice the general damage award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's judgment rendered in favor of the property owners was amended, in part, to reduce the $ 1 billion award for punitive damages to $ 112,290,000 to comply with the Due Process Clause. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed. Furthermore, the trial court's judgment denying the oil company's exception of prescription was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Ouachita, Louisiana, convicting him of malfeasance in office in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:134 and sentencing him to five years at hard labor with the first three years to be served without benefit of suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, an assistant parish administrator for the police, was convicted for using a parish employee, vehicle, and equipment for tree trimming work on his private property. On appeal, the court held that defendant's argument that the trial court erred by allowing a police officer to testify regarding taped interviews of defendant, when the tapes, transcribed notes, and investigating officer's notes were lost, was without merit because defendant conceded at trial that the State complied with discovery and disclosed the missing tapes prior to trial. However, the court held that defendant's sentence was excessive under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 because: (1) there was no indication that defendant exhibited any prior pattern of misusing public resources; (2) the offense also involved another employee's control and actions; (3) defendant was a 58-year-old first time offender with no criminal record; (4) defendant had a serious medical condition and his incarceration would involve an astronomical expense; and (5) the offense was far from the most egregious act of malfeasance or abuse of public position, as the actual out-of-pocket expenses to the parish amounted to less than $ 300.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was affirmed but his sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. An officer was dispatched regarding a man sitting on a gray pickup truck selling narcotics. When the officer arrived, he saw a gray truck with defendant sitting on the truck's open tailgate eating crabs. Defendant gave the officer his identification, and the officer called in defendant's personal information to determine if he had any outstanding warrants. While the officer was speaking to defendant, defendant appeared nervous, and his hands shook badly. Defendant would not make eye contact with him. The officer decided, for his own safety, to conduct a pat-down search of defendant's outer clothing for weapons. As defendant turned to comply with the order, he moved his hand toward his left pants pocket. Fearing defendant might be reaching for a weapon, the officer grabbed his hand, and placed him in handcuffs. The officer then felt what he believed were bags of narcotics. The officer reached into defendant's pocket and retrieved seven small bags containing what appeared to be marijuana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which convicted him of the distribution of cocaine in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(A) and sentenced him as a second offender to 20 years at hard labor without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for the distribution of cocaine, but the appellate court affirmed. The jury was presented with the direct testimony of an agent that he purchased one off-white rock object from defendant. The agent subsequently identified defendant both in a photographic lineup and in court as the person who sold him the drugs. The transaction was videotaped and played for the jury. Finally, the substance that the agent bought from defendant was tested and proved positive for the presence of cocaine. The jury also heard the evidence regarding the discrepancies in the time of the stop and the time of the transaction, as well as any conflicting testimony about the description of defendant. In reaching the guilty verdict, the jury obviously found the State's witnesses to have been more credible, a determination that was solely within the province of the trier of fact. The jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of the distribution of cocaine. Additionally, defendant was precluded from raising the issue of the admission of the crime lab report for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the judgment and ordered the district court to supplement the appellate record with the ruling on defendant's motion to reconsider sentence.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;22:1386 applied to the companies' accrued and pending claims retroactively. The companies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The companies argued that the trial court failed in retroactively applying the amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;22:1386(A). The appellate court noted that the amendment to &sect; 22:1386 created a new obligation or liability vis-a-vis the companies' solvent insurers by requiring that they provide coverage and pay claims for periods of alleged exposure for the insurer's policy years when they had no contractual obligation or statutory duty to provide coverage. The amendments effected a substantive change in the law with regard to payment of claims. By retroactive application of the statute, the legislature impaired the private contractual rights of the companies and it insurers by requiring the companies to assert claims against their solvent insurers, who could have provided insurance up to thirty years from the date of the alleged exposure for a brief period of time, and to demand coverage for claims for a period where insurers had no contract and did not receive premiums. Retroactive application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;22:1386 would deprive the companies of vested property rights acquired, asserted, and accrued as well as duties owed by LIGA prior to the passage of the legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and remanded and judgment was declared that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;22:1386 did not apply retroactively in the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, claimants, challenged the judgment of the Fourteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Calcasieu, Louisiana, determining the constitutionality of the limitation on recovery in medical malpractice actions found in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42(B), in the action with defendants, State of Louisiana, Louisiana Patient's Compensation Fund Oversight Board and medical center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court previously held the $ 500,000 statutory limit on recovery of damages in medical malpractice actions was unconstitutional in failing to provide the claimants an &quot;adequate remedy.&quot; This judgment was vacated by the Louisiana Supreme Court on procedural grounds, and the case was remanded to the appellate court for consideration of the remaining issues on appeal. The appellate court ruled that although it was satisfied the equal protection issue and the remaining issues were sufficiently pled below and were ripe for review, it would elect to remand the case to the trial court to allow the claimants an opportunity to particularize all grounds for their claim that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42(B) was unconstitutional in a proper amending and supplemental pleading. The trial court was instructed to re-examine all of the issues raised and to determine whether the statute was constitutional after permitting the parties to amend the pleadings, to conduct full discovery, to file additional motions and briefs, to introduce additional evidence, and to fully argue the issues advanced in all the pleadings pursuant to a contradictory hearing.</SPAN></P>

He appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant took his computer (the tower portion containing the hard drive) to a store. He instructed a computer technician there to install a new hard drive, but not to remove the old hard drive; he also agreed to a suggestion that the computer be physically cleaned. Defendant challenged the private search of his computer by the store's employees, and moved to quash the bill of information that charged him with pornography involving juveniles, claiming that the statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.1, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Defendant alleged that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained from the search of his computer which was subsequently used to obtain a warrant for the search of his residence. He contended that his right to privacy under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 was violated by the unauthorized private search of his computer by the employees who, in turn, reported their findings to police. Nevertheless, defendant was not constitutionally protected from a reasonable search by the store employees. Further, defendant's sentence was not disproportionate to the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a black voter, filed a petition for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants. Plaintiff attacked the system for electing judges to the Baton Rouge City Court on the basis that it violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the Louisiana Constitution. The trial court granted defendants' exception of no cause of action. On appeal, the court concluded that plaintiff did not have a cause of action under Louisiana law to contest the election of judges to the Baton Rouge City Court on the basis of the one-person, one-vote principle. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1952(4)(b) and (c), which established that five Baton Rouge City Court judges would be elected from two election districts, was facially neutral, and did not discriminate against black voters on its face. The mere fact that the State failed to pass redistricting legislation in light of updated census data was insufficient to state a cause of action for purposeful discrimination. Plaintiff failed to state a cause of action under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. No Louisiana case or statute gave a voter the right to demand that judicial election districts be reassessed and redrawn at regular intervals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;J&quot; (Louisiana), denied defendant's motion to quash the bill of information. Defendant withdrew her plea of guilty and pled guilty as charged, reserving her right to appeal the denial of her motion to quash. Defendant subsequently filed a motion for appeal that was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(E) was unconstitutionally vague. However, the appellate court found that former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(E)(5) was not unconstitutionally vague. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(B)(3) was a penalty provision for violations of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(A), which provided that it was unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute it. The language of former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(E)(5), when read in conjunction with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(A) and (B)(3) as required, was sufficiently clear. Thus, the State did not err by using defendant's prior conviction for possession with the intent to distribute marijuana as a predicate offense to enhance her current charge of possession of marijuana to second offense possession of marijuana. Because former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(E)(5) clearly and unambiguously provided that a conviction for possession with intent to distribute marijuana could be considered as a prior conviction for second or subsequent offenders, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to quash the bill of information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his challenge for cause of a potential juror should have been granted because the juror demonstrated bias in favor of the prosecution and his views towards defendant's failure to testify at trial suggested an inability to render judgment according to law. The court of appeal disagreed. A complete reading of the voir dire showed that the juror was a victim of crime and had several friends who were either prosecutors or police officers. He admitted his bias toward the State. However, when questioned by the trial judge, the juror stated that he would do his best to give defendant his day in court and weigh the evidence in a fair and impartial way. The juror also stated that he understood that the State had the burden to prove defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The juror, although exhibiting a pro-prosecution bias, demonstrated his willingness and ability to be impartial in reviewing the evidence and deciding the case. When asked if he would find defendant guilty because he did not testify, the juror stated affirmatively that he would not. Therefore, the trial court did not err by denying the challenge for cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for killing the victim by cutting her throat. On appeal, the court held that the eleven to one jury verdict was not unconstitutional because under both state and federal jurisprudence, a criminal conviction by a less than unanimous jury did not violate a defendant's right to trial by jury specified by the Sixth Amendment. The trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress DNA evidence because there was a reasonable and sufficiently individualized suspicion that defendant may have been involved in other crimes to justify the issuance of the subpoena duces tecum to take the DNA sample from him. The means and procedure employed in obtaining the sample were not unreasonable, as an officer swabbed defendant's cheeks in his home and defendant was not taken into custody at that time. Even though the trial court erred by admitting into evidence several of defendant's prior crimes, the error was harmless the evidence against defendant, including the DNA evidence linking him to the instant crime, his proximity to the crime scene, a boot print, knife wounds, and a telephone call from the victim's phone to defendant's former place of employment.</SPAN></P>

Upon the State's filing of a multiple bill of information, the Criminal District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, adjudicated defendant as a fourth offender, vacated the original sentence, and resentenced him to life imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended his life sentence as a multiple offender was constitutionally excessive as to him because of his speech problems and limited intellectual functioning. The appellate court disagreed, finding that while defendant committed his offense after the effective date of the amendments reducing the mandatory minimum sentence for habitual offenders, a life sentence was still the minimum that could be imposed under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 15:529.1(A)(1)(b)(i)(ii) because the instant felony conviction and two of his prior felony convictions were crimes of violence under La. Rev. Stat. 14:2(13). Furthermore, no evidence was presented to show there were mitigating factors that overwhelmed the presumption that the legislatively-mandated sentence was appropriate. A report generated for the competency hearing did not indicate that defendant suffered from any problems that prevented him from avoiding criminal conduct, and his criminal history could not be explained by either his disability or his lack of intelligence. The record clearly established that defendant was a sexual predator whose victims included children and who had a propensity for violence.</SPAN></P>

The gun left at the scene was traced to defendant's wife, who had reported the gun stolen. During a police interview, the wife admitted that defendant forced her to falsely report the gun stolen, and admitted that a week after she reported the theft, defendant told her he committed the robbery. The appellate court ruled that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that defendant was armed with a dangerous weapon. The restaurant manager testified defendant had a bag over his hand pointing at her when he ordered her to open the safe, and she automatically assumed there was a gun in the bag because of the way defendant was holding it. The manager did exactly what defendant wanted because she was scared, nervous, and shaking. Defendant clearly created an &quot;atmosphere of intimidation.&quot; Defendant's wife's gun was found in front of the safe, and it was not there prior to the robbery. Also, defendant admitted in his statement to the police that he left the gun in the restaurant after the robbery. Furthermore, the 30-year sentence was not constitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that the trial court's colloquy was insufficient because it only informed him of his right to cross-examine, and he asserted that the right of confrontation included the right to see as well as cross-examine the witnesses against him. The appellate court ruled that while the trial court and State should be advised that the better practice was to inform defendant of his right to a trial by jury at the time he pled guilty, the record supported a finding that defendant was aware of his right to a trial by jury and that his guilty plea was made with the knowledge that he was waiving his right to a trial by jury when he pled guilty. It was common sense that cross-examination was an adversarial act and necessarily included the right to see the witness. The circumstances in the case reflected an understanding and waiver of the right of confrontation. Also, defendant's sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal disagreed. The State proved by direct evidence, including witness testimony and physical evidence, that defendant took something of value ($ 120,000) from the bank without its consent and had the intent to deprive the bank of the money permanently. Two different bank officials testified that defendant admitted that she took the $ 120,000 in increments from the vault and spent it all. Further, defendant admitted at trial that she falsified general ledger entries to conceal the $ 120,000 shortage, which shortage was verified by an audit. The evidence indicated that defendant was the vault teller and had access to the funds missing from the vault. There was also direct evidence that the vault count on Friday was based on the general ledger entries, which defendant herself admitted at trial that she, as vault teller, falsified to reflect that the $ 120,000 shortage did not exist. Both tellers who participated in the &quot;intervening&quot; count testified that they did not take the money.</SPAN></P>

During the conversation, the employee allegedly threatened his supervisor because of a negative evaluation. The finance contacted the supervisor and informed her of the threat. The employee was terminated. The employee brought an action against defendants. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court found that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether defendants knew or had reason to know that the information regarding the threat was obtained in violation of the Louisiana Electronic Surveillance Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1303. Further, there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the employee's statements constituted a matter of public concern.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees property owner et al. brought a class action suit against appellant State, seeking just compensation for property taken and a declaration that Louisiana's Unclaimed Property law, La. rev.

The Nineteenth Judicial District Court of East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, certified a class and denied the State's exception of no right of action as to the owner. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the State challenged the judgment of certification and filed a writ application objecting to the trial court's denial of its exceptions. Even accepting all the petition's well pled allegations of fact as true, the appellate court held that the threshold assertion of the certified class, that a &quot;taking&quot; occurred when the State exercised its statutory custodial rights, was not based on well pled facts, but on a legal conclusion, clothed as fact. The correctness of that conclusion was contradicted by the Louisiana Uniform Unclaimed Property Act of 1997, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:151 et seq., and the jurisprudence. The State's exercise of its statutorily imposed custody, and the legislature's decision to award owners only the interest provided for in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:163, did not equate to a &quot;taking.&quot; In the absence of any actionable &quot;taking,&quot; there was no basis to claim a constitutionally mandated payment of &quot;just compensation.&quot; As such, the appellate court concluded that the trial court erred in denying the State's exception of no cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State's exception of no cause of action was granted and the matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

PARISH OF ACADIA, NO. 67,176. April 4, 2007, Decided HONORABLE KRISTIAN DENNIS EARLES, DISTRICT JUDGE.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE AMENDED.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for one count of forcible rape, and two counts of aggravated rape of the victims - three children. The State amended all charges to second degree sexual battery, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:43.2. He pled guilty to all three amended charges. The Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Acadia (Louisiana), sentenced him to serve 10 years for each offense and ordered that the sentences run consecutively. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because defendant committed the offenses against different victims on different dates, the appellate court found that, even though the offenses were joined in the same bill of indictment, they did not constitute the same act or transaction and were not part of a common scheme or plan. Moreover, because defendant was originally facing two counts of aggravated rape and one count of forcible rape, he received a substantial sentencing benefit. The 15-year maximum sentence for aggravated sexual battery under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:43.2 was immensely more lenient than the minimum sentence of life imprisonment for an aggravated rape conviction under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42 or the maximum sentence of 40 years for a forcible rape conviction under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42.1. Also, by pleading guilty to second degree sexual battery, defendant admitted that he acted with the specific intent to inflict serious bodily injury on the victims, thereby belying his assurance at sentencing that he had no intent to hurt the victims. Thus, the trial court did not err in ordering that defendant's sentences run consecutively, and his sentences were not excessive under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction; however, the appellate court amended defendant's sentences to reflect that he was not eligible for diminution of sentence pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:537 and instructed the trial court to note the amendment in the court minutes. In all other respects, defendant's sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff claimant appealed the judgment of the 19th Judicial District Court In and For the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Division &quot;H&quot; (Louisiana), finding that defendant university employee violated the claimant's civil rights but awarded her only nominal damages of $1.00 and finding that defendant board of supervisors did not retaliate against her. Defendant university appealed the assessment of nominal damages against it and its employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After roughly five years on the job where the claimant received positive evaluations, she (1) was threatened with termination by her employer, (2) learned that her employer had reported her difficulties at the university peace officer basic training academy to other potential academies, and (3) experienced mental and emotional problems to the extent that she required medical attention for extensive stress, a condition that incapacitated her from working for at least one month beginning in January 1998 and for another beginning in April 1998. Thus, she showed actual injuries that resulted directly from the employee's letter, which caused a violation of the claimant's rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Accordingly, she was entitled to compensation for her injuries. In addition, Louisiana's public universities, including Louisiana State University (through its Board of Supervisors), were to be treated as arms of the State. As such, the university was not a person vulnerable to suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Thus, the jury's verdict against it had to be reversed. Finally, the claimant proved that the board of supervisors retaliated against her, and she was entitled to compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court amended the trial court's judgment to award the claimant $10,000 in damages and $10,000 in attorney's fees for the employee's violation of her civil rights; as amended, that portion of the judgment was affirmed. The trial court's judgment against the board of supervisors as an entity was reversed and she was award $5,000 in damages and $5,000 in attorney's fees. However, her claims against the university were dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) of armed robbery. The court added an additional 5 years to defendant's sentence, to be served consecutively for defendant's use of a firearm. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. The court of appeal disagreed. The victim's testimony was clear that a shotgun was used in the commission of the crime, and that testimony was corroborated to some extent by a witness's testimony that the victim, who appeared very shaken, told her immediately after the robbery that he was robbed at gunpoint. As for the description of the firearm, it was possible that the victim mistook the sawed-off shotgun as having two barrels because the barrel was sawed off to approximately the same length as the tube that held the shotgun shells. As a person unfamiliar with guns, the victim could have made that mistake, especially if there had been a magazine extension on the gun. Although there were inconsistencies in the victim's version of how the robbers entered his apartment, much of defendant's argument concerned inconsistencies with respect to the initial police report, which was not entered into evidence. The trial court, as the finder of fact, was within its discretion to credit the victim's testimony that a firearm was used and to discredit defendant's testimony in that regard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The additional 5-year sentence imposed for use of a firearm during the robbery was vacated. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Criminal District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, convicted and sentenced defendant on one count of unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and raised several claims concerning his multiple offender adjudication. The appellate court found that the State established that defendant entered the victim's home early in the morning by breaking a window in a bedroom and, although the victim testified that she had ended her relationship with defendant a few weeks before the first burglary, defendant did not live in the residence. Given the circumstances of the case, as compared to other similar cases, the appellate court found the evidence was sufficient for the trial court to find that defendant entered the victim's house without authority. The appellate court also found that the State could bring the prior charges against defendant via a bill of information, even though he was exposed to a life sentence, because the allegations in the bill were not substantive charges but instead were merely prior convictions to be used to enhance his sentence. Defendant failed to preserve for review his other complaints regarding the multiple offender bill. Defendant's sentence was not excessive as he received the minimum sentence for a fourth offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 21st Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Tangipahoa, Louisiana, granted defendant coroner's peremptory exception in plaintiff family members' negligence action against the coroner for failing to take an x-ray of the decedent's injured knee and failing to order and/or conduct an autopsy on the decedent. The family members appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The family members argued that the coroner was legally obligated to perform an autopsy under La. Rev. Stat.

The appellate court found that the allegations of the family members' petition did not give rise to any cause of action against the coroner. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1563(B)(1) did not impose a duty on the coroner to conduct an autopsy for the benefit of private individuals, and therefore, the failure to conduct an autopsy did not give rise to a cause of action for damages to private individuals such as the family members. The coroner's agent investigated the decedent's death, noted the condition of her left leg, and was apprised that her physician concluded that she died from a heart attack. The family members failed to allege facts to show that there was a basis for the coroner to believe that there was a reasonable probability that the violation of a criminal statute contributed to the decedent's death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, a representative of city incorporators, sought to have upheld the incorporation's validity under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:1-7, challenging a decision of the 19th Judicial District Court Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which found that a judgment rendered prior to the incorporation, declaring a provision barring the incorporation to be unconstitutional and contrary to state law, was null and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Previously, residents of the then-unincorporated area of the parish obtained a judgment that a section of the parish's government plan was unconstitutional. That section provided that no additional city, town, or village could be incorporated in the parish; the trial court found that section of the plan to be null and void. Thereafter, a special election was held, and the city was incorporated. Subsequently, the trial court entered an order nullifying the previous judgment, finding that it was a &quot;friendly,&quot; if not collusive, proceeding. However, it did not rule on the validity of the election. Petitioners attacked the trial court's ruling that the earlier judgment was a nullity; moreover, they argued that, even if it was a nullity, it could not serve as a basis to invalidate the incorporation. The state appellate court agreed. After 1984, pursuant to La. Const. art. VI, &sect;&nbsp;8, the section of the government plan in issue was unconstitutional. Thus, even if the effect of the judgment nullifying the previous judgment was to put that section back on the books, it was not enforceable, pursuant to La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2, because it conflicted with the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Seventh Judicial District Court, Parish of Concordia (Louisiana), convicting her of filing a false record in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:133 and sentencing her to five years at hard labor, with all but 18 months suspended, and five years of supervised probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of filing a false absentee ballot. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because: (1) the ballot affidavit included a certification of truth that had to be signed by the voter; (2) signing as a witness that a signed certification of truth was sworn to and subscribed in the signer's presence, when in fact it was not, constituted a false representation for purposes of the statute; (3) La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:306(E)(2) was controlling; and (4) the purported witnesses themselves admitted that they did not actually see the voter sign the ballot affidavits. However, the court held that defendant's five-year sentence with only 18 months not suspended was excessive because the trial court did not give adequate consideration to defendant's health, age, and personal history by not imposing a longer period of suspension. The trial court's concern that defendant would commit a similar crime was adequately addressed by the five-year period of probation imposed, during which time defendant would risk serving the entire incarceration portion of her sentence should she engage in further criminal activity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was affirmed, but her sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing and for a hearing on whether she was indigent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff husband challenged a judgment of the Thirty-Ninth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Red River, Louisiana, which ruled in favor of defendant cemetery in the husband's action to enjoin the cemetery's orders to remove certain structures from the husband's family gravesite.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband's wife was buried in the cemetery, and the husband erected an arbor and canopy structure over the entire family plot with the cemetery's approval. Citing complaints, the cemetery three years later told the husband to remove the structures and told him that a water hydrant used by the husband was being relocated. On appeal, the court found that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8:202, the cemetery was private property subject to the special public use involving cemeteries. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8:204 enumerated the special authority that the cemetery had over the use, care, control, management, restriction and protection of the cemetery as private property subject to public use. The cemetery had authority to regulate the uniformity, class and kind of all markers, monuments and other structures within the cemetery, as recognized in &sect; 8:204(2). The cemetery's action were taken in a reasonable manner with advance notice provided to the husband, and the decision to require removal of the structures was not arbitrary or capricious. The husband's special right in the property as a relative of those buried in the cemetery was therefore subject to the cemetery's maintenance authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Twenty years after his uncle's death, appellant nephew filed suit claiming an interest in succession property and that appellees, his uncle's widow and their two daughters, intentionally concealed that his uncle was actually his biological father. The Thirty-Second Judicial District Court, Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, sustained the widow's and the daughters' peremptory exception of prescription and dismissed the claims. The nephew appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the nephew asserted that the trial court erred in his dismissing his claims as untimely under former La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 209. Alternatively, the nephew argued that his claim for intentional concealment was one sounding in tort; therefore, it was exempt from the peremptive period pursuant to the tort exception contained in art. 209. The appellate court disagreed, holding first that the time limitation in art. 209 was peremptive. Accordingly, the nephew's argument that the trial court erred in failing to find that the period was prescriptive and subject to the doctrine of contra non valentem had no merit. The appellate court further found that the nephew's action was one to establish filiation in an effort to recover lost succession rights. Notwithstanding his creative claim for mental pain and suffering, the nephew essentially sought a portion of the former succession property, or, alternatively, to receive the value of that property in &quot;tort&quot; damages. As such, the appellate court found that his claims were not exempt from the peremptive period by virtue of the tort exception in art. 209.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was amended to state that the peremptory exception raising the objection of prescription filed by two of the appellees was sustained, and the nephew's claims against them were dismissed. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;G&quot; (Louisiana), denied defendant's motion to suppress her statements and a motion to quash the indictment. After the State amended the indictment to charge defendant with manslaughter, she entered an Alford plea of guilty to manslaughter, reserving her right to appeal all pretrial motions. She was then sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor for 40 years. She appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A dead baby boy was discovered in a trash receptacle at an apartment complex. Although the child's autopsy report indicated that there were levels of cocaine and alcohol in his body at birth, there was no evidence presented at the motion to suppress hearing that defendant was rendered incoherent by intoxication at any time she spoke to the police. Also, a detective denied that she cried for the duration of her two interviews and stated that she had her bouts and periods that she would cry, and sometimes she would not. Further, the detective testified that defendant understood she was under investigation for first degree murder, and that she was coherent and cooperative at the hospital, as well as during the successive recorded statements. Additionally, defendant signed waiver of rights forms prior to making both recorded statements, indicating that she had been advised of her constitutional rights and that she wanted to waive them. Thus, the trial judge could have concluded that defendant's statements were freely and voluntarily given and did not err in denying her motion to suppress her statements to the detective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence; however, the appellate court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions for the trial court to correctly inform defendant of the prescriptive provisions for seeking post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the record was devoid of any allegations or proof of the unfitness of the mother. Moreover, the inability of the mother and the grandparents to communicate or agree on many issues or the mother's alleged concern for an encroachment on an inheritance she believed she and her children were entitled to receive from the grandparents did not amount to extraordinary circumstances as required by article 136B to support an award of visitation to the relatives not granted custody of the children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">There was evidence that the jury was reasonable in finding that defendant was positively identified, including that a detective involved in the drug buy made an in-court identification of defendant as the seller.

Although defendant was a first felony offender, the appellate court did not find the sentence imposed upon him by the trial court was excessive because (1) although defendant was a first time felony offender, he had been arrested in the mean time for aggravated assault in which he allegedly possessed a gun and pointed it at other individuals; (2) there was undue risk that during a suspended sentence or probation, he would commit another crime; (3) he was in need of correctional treatment; (4) a lesser sentence would deprecate the seriousness of his crime; (5) there were no mitigating circumstances and no remorse; and (6) the sentence was less than half of the allowable maximum sentence of 30 years under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Thirty-Second Judicial District Court, Parish of Terrebonne (Louisiana) of vehicular homicide. Defendant was sentenced to seven years at hard labor, with the first year of the sentence to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant's motion to reconsider sentence was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. The court of appeals disagreed. The evidence clearly established that defendant had an unlawful blood alcohol concentration while he was operating his vehicle. Five witnesses testified that they saw defendant drinking at a club that night before he wrecked his truck. Moreover, the crime lab report indicated that defendant had a blood alcohol concentration of .25 percent, more than three times the legal limit. The evidence further supported the jury's finding that defendant's highly-inebriated condition caused him to wreck his truck, which resulted in the death of the passenger. Defendant was doing &quot;doughnuts&quot; in his truck shortly before driving down the highway. The passenger told a friend over the telephone that defendant was &quot;driving messed up&quot; and that she was scared and she wanted defendant to pull over. Under those circumstances, given defendant's reckless manner of driving from the time he left the parking lot until the time he wrecked, it was reasonable for the jury to infer that his blood alcohol concentration contributed to his running off the road and losing control of his truck.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Seventeenth Judicial District Court, Parish of LaFourche (Louisiana) of distribution of marijuana as a second or subsequent offender. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeal found, inter alia, that defendant was improperly charged under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:982 because it did not define a crime. Consequently, since &sect; 40:982 was a non-crime, and since La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966 contained no proscriptions against defendant's most recent conduct charged, i.e., distribution of marijuana, the second drug conviction portion of defendant's conviction and sentence was vacated. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for a new trial based upon the fact that several jurors consumed alcoholic beverages during the trial proceedings. The court of appeal disagreed. In denying defendant's request to call the jurors in question, the trial court specifically noted there had been no threshold showing of impairment. The trial court found that absent such evidence of prejudice, there could be no substantial showing of deprivation of constitutional rights to require or allow members of the jury to testify. Under those circumstances, the trial court correctly applied the jury shield law under La. Code Evid. art. 606(B) and limited the testimony at the new trial hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was reversed and was amended to a conviction for distribution of marijuana.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant's motion to suppress the evidence was denied, the Criminal District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, convicted him of simple possession of cocaine. The State subsequently filed a multiple bill, and defendant was found to be a third offender and was sentenced to serve eight years at hard labor. Defendant's motion to reconsider sentence was denied, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred by finding him to be a third offender and by not strictly complying with the requirements of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. The appellate court disagreed, finding that under Apprendi, defendant's prior convictions were not required to be submitted to a jury. Further, there was no requirement that the State submit its documentation to the defense prior to the multiple bill hearing. And after pleading not guilty to the bill, defendant did not object or ask for a continuance in order to allow him time to investigate the allegations. Defendant and his counsel were allowed time to discuss the matter before he was found to be a third offender, and again defendant did not object to the documents or ask for a continuance. Although La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(D)(3) required the trial court to issue written reasons, the trial court's failure to file written reasons was harmless as its oral reasons showed that it had concluded that the State's documentation was sufficient to establish the prior convictions. The State more than adequately proved that defendant's prior guilty plea was voluntarily and knowingly given.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which convicted him of manslaughter in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant killed the victim during a dispute over a bet in a dominos game and defendant currently appealed his conviction for manslaughter and his 20-year sentence. The appellate court affirmed however, stating that the evidence was sufficient. Defendant was free to leave the scene, although $10 poorer. Instead, he armed himself and went back to the victim, eventually shooting him when the victim grabbed him. Defendant also contended that the trial court imposed an excessive sentence, but the appellate court disagreed. First, there was no indication that defendant filed a motion to reconsider the sentence as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.1. Additionally, his former counsel's failure to object or file a motion to reconsider the sentence did not constitute the ineffective assistance of counsel because the sentence did not appear to have been excessive as compared to the sentences imposed and upheld in other manslaughter cases. The trial court complied with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 in that its reasons for the sentence were several pages long. Although the trial court did not enumerate that art. 894.1 factors, the record showed the basis for the sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal disagreed. The trial court, prosecution, and defense referred to the charges as separate offenses at all times during the proceedings. Additionally, both the prosecution and the defense compartmentalized their arguments according to the separate counts. The evidence against defendant on each count was not complex and was presented in an orderly fashion, allowing the jury to segregate the charges and the evidence. Each victim testified exclusively concerning the facts of her individual case. Defendant, his mother, and the DNA analyst were the only witnesses to testify with regard to all three of the rapes. Furthermore, the trial court specifically instructed the jury to consider the counts separately and render a verdict as to each count independently. Therefore, defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court denial of severance of the offenses. In addition, the evidence was sufficient to sustain all of defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a husband and a son, sued defendants, a doctor and his insurer, alleging medical malpractice regarding the treatment of a decedent. In the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu, Louisiana, a jury found in favor of the doctor. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent presented to an emergency room complaining of chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The decedent's father and five siblings died due to heart conditions. After ordering an EKG, lab tests, and chest x-rays, the doctor diagnosed the decedent as having gastroenteritis and prescribed a GI cocktail for her symptoms. This eased the decedent's nausea, but her chest pain did not subside. The doctor eventually gave the decedent a shot of morphine for her pain and discharged her. The decedent was never given any aspirin or nitroglycerine. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2794, the appellate court determined that the decision of the jury that the doctor did not fail to meet his standard of care was manifestly erroneous, unsupported by the record, and a result of jury confusion. The doctor clearly admitted that he breached the standard of care in failing to rule out cardiac ischemia, a potentially life threatening condition, prior to the decedent's discharge. Under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2164 and La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315.1, the appellate court awarded appropriate amounts for the survival action and wrongful death damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court reversed the judgment of the trial court, rendered judgment in favor of plaintiffs, and awarded, inter alia, wrongful death damages, survival damages, and interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was not subjected to double jeopardy where his guilty plea convictions and sentence were vacated on appeal. He was not deprived of due process when he received harsher treatment and a longer sentence after successfully appealing his prior guilty pleas as the parties were in the same position as they were prior to acceptance of the plea bargain. Defendant's constitutional protections against multiple punishments was not violated as additional evidence was offered at trial showing that he committed lewd and lascivious behavior, thereby supporting the molestation conviction. However, the indecent behavior conviction subjected defendant to double jeopardy as the same evidence used to prove molestation was used to prove indecent behavior. There was no appearance of retaliation in sentencing as defendant was placed in the same position after the original sentence was vacated. The harsher sentence was justified based on the charge of being a habitual offender. However, the sentence was vacated because it appeared that defendant received four life sentences and the trial court did not specify which of the four counts in the habitual offender bill was being enhanced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction and sentence for indecent behavior with a juvenile was reversed and vacated.

The Civil District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, agreed and dismissed the owners and business. The buyer's motion for new trial was denied, and it appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the buyer contended the trial court erred by holding that La. Rev. Stat.

The appellate court disagreed, finding that the buyer admitted that it did not acquire or could not have acquired knowledge of the alleged pre-existing termite damage until years after the purchase. Thus was when the buyer acquired the right to sue. Accordingly, the trial court was not manifestly erroneous in its factual conclusions that the buyer did not suffer damage until then, and the peremptive period from &sect; 9:5607 applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant's motion to suppress confession, identification, and physical evidence was denied, he entered a plea of guilty. The Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, sentenced defendant to 10 years imprisonment for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and 5 years fiver years for possession of marijuana. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently with credit given for time served. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the attempted stop was without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. The appellate court disagreed, finding that, with or without reasonable suspicion, the officers, from approximately 10 feet away, had the right to ask defendant to come over toward them &quot;for a second.&quot; The request, in a public area and without any greater show of authority, did not transform the encounter into a forcible detention, and defendant was free to leave. After defendant took off in headlong flight, the totality of the circumstances known to the officers at the time, including the knowledge that the area was prone to drug trafficking, defendant's suspicious behavior and his unprovoked flight into oncoming traffic, gave rise to reasonable suspicion for an investigatory detention. The detention and pat down for safety reasons following defendant's fall was reasonable to protect the officers and members of the public, especially as defendant behaved as if he was carrying a weapon. Therefore, the appellate court found no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The convictions and sentences were affirmed, but the case was remanded to the trial court with orders that defendant be properly informed of the prescriptive period for filing for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, (Louisiana) convicting and sentencing him for four counts of aggravated battery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34, one count of second-degree kidnapping in violation of La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:44.1, and two counts of aggravated assault upon a peace officer with a firearm in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:37.2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of numerous crimes arising out of his holding hostages in his home and shooting at police officers. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by including aggravated battery as a responsive verdict to the charged crime of attempted first-degree murder of a peace officer because an essential element of aggravated battery, physical contact with the victim, was missing from first-degree murder. Retrying defendant on the charge of first-degree murder would violate defendant's right against double jeopardy because by finding defendant guilty of the lesser offense of aggravated battery, the jury acquitted him of first-degree murder. The court also reversed defendant's conviction of aggravated assault against one of the police officers because that officer did not testify at trial regarding the effect of defendant's actions upon him as required. However, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of second-degree kidnapping, even though that victim did not testify, because it was undisputed that defendant aimed a gun at her while using her as a shield from the police.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions and sentences on four counts of aggravated battery were reversed, as were his conviction and sentence on one count of aggravated assault on a peace officer with a firearm. His remaining convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer filed a petition for refund of ad valorem taxes paid under protest claiming that its property was located in an &quot;industrial area&quot; and was, therefore, not subject to taxation. Ultimately, the Ninth Judicial District Court of Rapides Parish, Louisiana, granted appellee taxing entities' motion for summary judgment, finding no genuine issue of fact that the taxpayer was entitled to a refund. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the taxpayer contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred by not finding that industrial areas were not subject to annexation, incorporation, or inclusion by any newly created municipality or district, and therefore, that the taxpayer's property was not &quot;property subject to taxation&quot; by the newly created recreation district, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:130.15-130.16 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:1202-1203. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:130.16 was tacitly repealed and replaced by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:1203. And under &sect; 51:1203, any business located in an industrial area that provided the listed services for itself was, thereafter, immune from being included in any newly created municipality. Further, the distinction between a municipality and a special service district was irrelevant. The tacit repeal of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:130.16, as replaced by La. Rev. Stat. Ann.&nbsp;&sect; 52:1203, only conferred the exclusion from municipalities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) convicted defendant of possession of a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance, cocaine, and possession of a Schedule I controlled dangerous substance, MDMA (Ecstasy). He was sentenced to serve consecutive sentences of five years for the cocaine conviction and one year for the Ecstasy conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because it seemed as if two individuals were about to get into a fight, two police officers confronted them. While the first officer performed a pat down search of defendant, he and the second officer observed an object fall to the ground. Defendant appeared to conceal the baggy and mash it into the ground with his foot. Defendant began to resist as the officers attempted to handcuff him. He elbowed the first officer in his chest, ignored the second officer's warning to stop and get on the ground, and fled. The second officer recovered the baggy from the ground and pursued defendant. Defendant was ultimately taken into custody. The baggy was later determined to contain cocaine and Ecstasy. Defense counsel waived defendant's right to a jury trial on defendant's behalf. Pursuant to La. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 780, the waiver was valid because it was knowingly and intelligently made since defendant waived the right to gain an advantage - a delay before commencement of his trial. Also, because defendant had a prior conviction, resisted arrest, and denied possessing drugs, his sentences were not constitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Parish of Calcasieu, Fourteenth Judicial District Court (Louisiana), convicted defendant of manslaughter. The trial court sentenced him to the maximum term of 21 years at hard labor. Since he had already served 44 years, he was released from custody. As part of the sentence, the trial court ordered him to pay all court costs associated with the proceedings. He moved to vacate that order, but the trial court denied his motion. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Sixty days after defendant was sentenced, the trial court issued an order casting defendant with court costs and indigent defense fees in the amount of $ 127,905.45 under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 887(A) and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:148. The amount defendant had been assessed was extraordinary when compared to the amounts assessed in prior cases. Although he was granted 15 days to object, the trial court appeared to give little consideration to defendant's plea that the total amount was unprecedented, excessive, and too burdensome under the circumstances. The trial court decided to maintain the order directing defendant to pay $ 127, 905.45 as court costs despite the trial court's recognition that defendant was indigent and did not currently have the ability to pay it. In addition, the appellate court found that the trial court was not authorized to issue a judgment directing defendant to reimburse the indigent defender's board for the costs associated with his defense under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:148, including expert witness fees and expenses because, at all relevant times, even up to the date of his sentence, defendant was indigent - a fact which was undisputed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of distribution of marijuana, adjudicated as a fourth felony offender, and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment at hard labor. On appeal, defendant argued that his sentence was excessive. The court found that the record indicated that at the time defendant committed the offense, he was 25 years old and already had three previous felony convictions. Although the prior convictions were not for crimes of violence, that was not enough to warrant a downward deviation of his sentence from that which was mandated under the Louisiana Habitual Offender Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. Moreover, it was clear from his record that defendant was likely to commit another offense. Because defendant did not put forth other evidence, he did not prove clearly and convincingly that a downward deviation from the mandatory sentence was warranted. The court concluded that the imposed sentence of 20 years at hard labor was not excessive under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Nineteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, convicted defendant of first degree murder, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30. Defendant was sentenced to death by lethal injection. The death sentence was subsequently set aside, and defendant was resentenced to life imprisonment. His motion for reconsideration of sentence was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to reconsider his sentence. Defendant argued that the sentence violated the Unites States and Louisiana Constitutions. The appellate court determined that upon invalidation of a provision of statutory capital punishment, the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon a conviction for first degree murder was the most severe penalty established by the legislature for criminal homicide at the time of the offense. The penalty for first degree murder at the time of the offense was death or life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence in accordance with the determination of the jury, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30(C). Imposition of a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Defendant's sentence did not violate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, there was no reason for the trial court to deviate from the mandatory sentence. The sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive and was not grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After his motion to suppress was denied, defendant entered a Crosby plea to illegal carrying of weapons while in the possession of controlled dangerous substances. The Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court of Bossier Parish, Louisiana, sentenced defendant to serve eight years imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, to be served consecutively with any other sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress and argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95(E) was unconstitutional as applied to him. The appellate court found that the trial judge's advice to defendant of his right to confront his accusers before entering his guilty plea was inadequate and required that his conviction and sentence be vacated. As to defendant's suppression arguments, the appellate court found that the officers had sufficient reason to commence their investigation pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 215.1 when they observed that defendant's vehicle was parked sideways across two parking spaces and its license plate had expired. Furthermore, defendant signed a consent to search form, consent was given almost contemporaneously with the end of the traffic stop, and there was no indication of any coercion or other improper action by the officers. Finally, the appellate court ruled that the exceptions under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95(E) were not irrational and the statute was not invalid because of them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff insurance company sought review of an order from the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana), which denied one of its petitions for nullity against defendant, the State of Louisiana, after judgments of bond forfeiture were entered in two criminal matters for which it acted as a commercial surety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company filed petitions for nullity after judgments of bond forfeiture were entered in two criminal matters for which it acted as a commercial surety. The trial court granted one of the petitions, annulling one of the judgments after a determination that the forfeiture was not supported by adequate evidence. As for the remaining matter, the trial court found that the commissioner lacked authority to issue the judgment of bond forfeiture. However, due to the trial court's determination that the commissioner was acting as a de facto officer, the petition for nullity was denied. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's application of the de facto official doctrine was consistent with the framework set forth by the Louisiana Supreme Court in O'Reilly. As in O'Reilly, the commissioner entering the judgment of bond forfeiture was not an usurper of office acting without color of right. Rather, like the commissioners in O'Reilly, the commissioner held an office created by statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:716(A). The company's assignment of error further lacked merit insofar as it argued that the commissioner's action was contrary to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:85.</SPAN></P>
