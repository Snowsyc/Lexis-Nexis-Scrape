Stat.

Because the panel did not apply the court's Rose-based test when it extended Montoy to exclusively focus on cost estimates, it made no findings arising from that test that the court could review, and the court remanded for the panel to make an adequacy determination under the Rose-based test; [2]-The court agreed with the panel's conclusion that the legislature's withholding of all capital outlay equalization payments since fiscal year 2010 rendered the operation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-8814(c)&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

And although she generally referenced the volume of sexual contact and the physical evidence, she also unabashedly opined about his veracity. Further, the misconduct denied defendant a fair trial; [2]-The district court erred by excluding testimony about prior false allegations of sexual abuse on the basis that the proffered witnesses were related to defendant because Kan.

The mere passage of time did not change the fact that the crimes could be characterized as cold-blooded murders with the same handgun under similar circumstances; [2]-Although the police used an unnecessarily suggestive procedure, the identification bore indicia of reliability and did not create a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification; therefore, the district court did not err in allowing the jury to decide whether the evidence was believable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Reno District Court (Kansas) of aggravated indecent liberties with a child and sentenced to a hard 25 life sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the district court erred when it allowed the State, through the parties' stipulation, to present evidence to the jury that he possessed homosexual pornography. The supreme court agreed. Evidence of defendant merely possessing homosexual pornography was not probative under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-401 to rebutting or impeaching his claim of not being gay. The stipulation stated that in addition to possessing gay pornography, defendant also possessed heterosexual pornography. Thus, at the most, the evidence established that defendant had an interest in viewing both homosexual and heterosexual pornography. However, the error was harmless because during a conversation with the child, defendant clearly expressed an awareness of the seriousness and the heinous nature of his conduct with the child. Although the incidents were never described during the conversation, the child's trial testimony and defendant's statements during the conversation expressing fear of going to jail for the rest of his life if the child's mother found out about the activities established that defendant engaged in the charged acts.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 75-5958 (2006 Supp.), for Medicaid reimbursement purposes, there was no change of ownership and no arms-length transaction, and the correct method for calculating the reimbursement rate was averaging the facilities' 2003, 2004, and 2005 cost reports; [3]-The common-ownership classification bore a reasonable relationship to a valid legislative purpose of controlling Medicaid costs.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The investigations occurred while law enforcement officers were still tracking down information and were prompted by new information disclosed through that investigation. The interviews occurred in defendant's hospital room, a neutral location. Defendant's family members were present during one interview. The interviews were short in duration and dealt with defendant's accounting of events and the identification of the shooter. Defendant had been told she could ask the officers to leave; in other words, she was in control of the length of the interviews. They used a conversational tone, asked for the truth, and offered protection for defendant, if needed. Defendant was not arrested at the end of either of the interviews. There was no evidence defendant suffered from any mental, intellectual, or emotional problems that would have affected her perception of whether she was free to terminate the questioning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by admitting gang affiliation evidence under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-401(b). The supreme court disagreed. The trial court determined that the gang affiliation evidence provided a reason for the proposed meeting between defendant and the victim and provided an alternative motive for the shooting. The trial court later reiterated that the gang affiliation evidence was admissible because it &quot;showed motive&quot; and because &quot;it formed parts of the events surrounding the commission of the crime.&quot; Gang affiliation, hierarchy, and rules explained why the victims and defendant ended up outside simultaneously. The victim had agreed to meet defendant there because defendant knew that the victim had killed another person. The victim also knew that gang protocol made him subject to sanctions for the killing, to be decided by defendant as chief of the gang. The necessity of the meeting arose out of gang life, and it was probative of defendant' identity and opportunity to shoot at the victim. Gang rule enforcement or retaliation also provided potential explanation for why defendant, in particular, would shoot the victims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the sentencing hearing in this case, the court filed several decisions explaining the steps to be taken if a sentencing court departs from the sentence provided for in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4643(a), (d). The sentencing court did not explicitly take these steps or make the corresponding findings. The sentencing court did not acknowledge defendant's presumptive sentence under the Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act. Nor did it discuss aggravating factors that would justify the upward departure from the presumptive guidelines sentence. Rather, the sentencing court merely skipped from life imprisonment to 120 months at the suggestion of the parties. Because the sentencing court did not comply with the procedure set forth in State v. Jolly, defendant's 120-month prison sentence was illegal. Because the sentence was illegal, the court's appellate jurisdiction fell into the limited exception where Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4721 did not apply.</SPAN></P>

The insurance guaranty association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against the doctor, who had a $ 200,000 professional liability insurance policy. The insurer was declared insolvent after the claimant filed his lawsuit, but before he recovered. The insurance guaranty association, which substituted some coverage for certain claims against insolvent insurers, denied liability because the claimant received coverage from his personal health insurance policy exceeding the insolvent insurer's policy limits. Such an offset was not permitted under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-2910 before it was amended, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-2910 (Supp. 2010), to include a retroactive provision permitting that offset. The trial court found it could not apply the offset retroactively to his pending claim without violating his due process rights. The state supreme court found that (1) the pre-amended statute did not allow the offset; (2) the Guaranty Act applied to his lawsuit; and (3) the amendment was remedial and could not be retroactively applied to his lawsuit because it violated his due process rights to recover from the insurance guaranty association the sum owed to him because the doctor's insurer had become insolvent.</SPAN></P>

The property owners and rights owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board passed a resolution that amended its zoning regulations to permit small wind farms but prohibit commercial wind farms in the county. The property owners, and the rights owners who only owned purported wind rights in the county, sued the Board. The trial court granted several dispositive Board motions. The state supreme court ruled, but also requested supplemental briefing as to whether the trial court erred in deciding as a matter of law that the Board did not violate the Takings Clause or the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. After supplemental briefing, it then found that: (1) the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment claim, and related 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and inverse condemnation claims, were properly dismissed since the property owners and wind rights owners did not have a constitutionally-cognizable property interest in their conditional use permits which were obtained through the issuer's discretionary authority; and (2) no discrimination was shown as to interstate commerce, but a remand was required to determine under the Pike balancing test whether the burden on interstate commerce was clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court affirmed dismissal of the Takings Clause, related 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and inverse condemnation claims.

It reversed dismissal of the Commerce Clause claim alleging impermissible incidental burdens on interstate commerce and related 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. It also remanded for further proceedings on those claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) that convicted him of seven counts of aggravated indecent liberties with a child under age 14 under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3504, arguing that the district court erred when it declined to modify the jury instruction on burden of proof to reflect the jury's power of nullification and erred in imposing lifetime electronic monitoring as part of his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with and convicted of aggravated indecent liberties with a child under age 14 for lewdly fondling or touching six boys, five of whom were in the same fourth grade class where defendant worked as a paraprofessional. On review, the court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on jury nullification because it was the proper function and duty of a jury to accept the rules of law given to it in the instructions by the court, apply those rules of law in determining what facts were proven, and render a verdict based thereon. Accordingly, an instruction enabling the power of jury nullification would be inappropriate because it would undermine the traditional functions of the court and the jury. However, the court agreed that the portion of defendant's sentence requiring lifetime electronic monitoring was erroneous because, under the plain language of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3717(u), the parole board had the sole authority to impose the electronic monitoring condition of parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed, but his sentence was vacated in part, and the case was remanded with instructions to eliminate the electronic monitoring requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board levied a special tax assessment against real property owned by the property owners for cleanup costs the county claimed it incurred while cleaning up that property. The property owners challenged the assessment, but both the trial court and appellate court found subject matter jurisdiction lacking; however, despite finding it lacked jurisdiction, the trial court granted summary judgment to the county and denied it to the property owners while the appellate court simply found that all of the claims to be jurisdictionally barred. The state supreme court found that the issue was whether the claims could be brought on direct review under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-907(a), which provided injunctive relief against an illegal levy or enforcement of any tax, charge, or assessment. It then determined that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-907(a) was not a jurisdictional bar to claims that were administrative in nature, and, thus, the appellate court had to consider the property owners' claims that the county acted in excess of its statutory authority, that the Board's resolution regarding the cleanup was unconstitutional as applied, and that the county engaged in arbitrary and capricious conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court found the property owners satisfied the jurisdictional bar regarding (1) the county allegedly exceeding its statutory authority; (2) the Board's enactment of a resolution being unconstitutional; and (3) the county allegedly engaging in arbitrary and capricious conduct. It also remanded the case to the appellate court to consider whether summary judgment had been properly granted on non-jurisdictionally barred claims.</SPAN></P>

The officer detained defendant long enough for defendant's parole officer to appear and conduct a search of the vehicle. The search revealed contraband drug evidence. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress and found defendant guilty of possession of cocaine with intent to sell, possession of cocaine without tax stamps, and possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to package a controlled substance for sale. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court found that while there was a valid basis for stopping defendant's vehicle because he was speeding, the officer's detention of defendant for approximately 35 minutes while the officer waited for the parole officer to appear and conduct a search was not reasonable, violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights even as a parolee, and meant that the drug evidence had to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The driver informed the officer that the driver had been drinking and eventually said that he had consumed six beers. He exhibited three clues of intoxication on a walk-and-turn sobriety test and one clue on a one-leg-stand sobriety test. The officer then performed a preliminary breath test (PBT) that the driver failed. Appellant state revenue agency suspended the driver's license, but the trial court reversed the suspension upon finding that there was not reasonable grounds to administer an evidentiary breath test under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1001 (Supp. 2007). The state supreme court found that reasonable grounds to test existed even without the results of the PBT. It thus found it was unnecessary to consider the constitutionality of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1012 (Supp. 2007) regarding the authority to conduct preliminary breath tests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Johnson District Court (Kansas) interpreted Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-307e, regarding a proposed rezoning of property within one mile of appellant county's executive airport, to mean the county had to approve the proposed rezoning unless it could show appellee city's decision regarding it was unreasonable. The city had approved it, but the county had disapproved it. The state supreme court transferred the county's appeal to it on its own motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-307e, about rezoning property within one mile of the county's executive airport, required a proposed rezoning to have the approval of the city and the county where the property was located. The city in the present case approved the proposed rezoning, but the county did not. On judicial review of the county's disapproval, the trial court found the county's authority was limited to conducting a quasi-judicial review of the city's approval. The trial court then held that the county had to approve the proposed rezoning unless it could establish that the city's decision was unreasonable. Since it did not believe the county met that burden, it upheld the city's approval. The state supreme court found that K.S.A. 3-307e allowed the county to reach an independent determination that a court had to presume to be reasonable. It then found that due to that presumption, to successfully challenge the county's action under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-307e, a landowner had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the county's action was unlawful or unreasonable. It concluded that because the trial court did not apply those rules, further proceedings were required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Riley District Court (Kansas) of premeditated first-degree murder, aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, and residential burglary. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a hard 50 mandatory minimum term on the primary offense of murder, plus a consecutive term of 74 months for the other offenses. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying a voluntary intoxication instruction because it erred in finding that there was insufficient evidence to find that defendant's mental faculties were so impaired as to render him unable to form the requisite intent. The supreme court disagreed. Although there was evidence that defendant had consumed alcohol and marijuana on the night of the murder, there was not evidence which, viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, was sufficient to justify a rational factfinder finding that he was so intoxicated that he was unable to form the specific intent necessary for the crimes charged. Witnesses described defendant as &quot;high&quot; or &quot;intoxicated,&quot; but all believed that he was aware of what was going on and what he was doing. Perhaps more importantly, defendant provided a detailed recollection of the events on the night of the offense, which demonstrated that his mental faculties were intact. The trial court used the appropriate standard to determine whether a voluntary intoxication instruction was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with multiple felonies related to four separate cocaine sales. Two people allegedly assisted her in making those sales to a buyer, who actually was an informant working with police. At her trial, witnesses for the State identified two individuals sitting in the courtroom and wearing orange jail jumpsuits as  individuals who were with defendant during one or more of the sales. Defendant moved for a Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3423(1)(c) mistrial, which the trial court denied. A jury then convicted her of 14 felonies related to the sales. On appeal, she challenged the denial of the mistrial motion and sufficiency of the evidence. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court found that it was error to allow the two individuals dressed in jail clothing to be identified as associates of defendant since doing so could possibly impact her right to a fair trial and presumption of innocence under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. However, it found that the error was harmless since it did not impact beyond a reasonable doubt the outcome of her trial and that the evidence was sufficient to support her convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) that convicted him of first-degree felony murder under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3401(b), arguing that there was insufficient evidence of a causal connection between the traffic fatality and his cocaine possession charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant struck and killed another motorist during a high-speed getaway from a traffic stop. He was apprehended, and cocaine was discovered. The underlying felony for the first-degree felony-murder conviction was possession of cocaine. On review, the court held that it belied common sense to argue that defendant's decision to flee the traffic stop was limited to just one of his crimes and not the others. There was no evidence to reasonably determine that defendant's flight was due to his driver's license violation to the exclusion of the more serious crime of cocaine possession. It was reasonable for the jury to conclude that defendant fled because of all of his crimes: the suspended license, illegal possession of a firearm, and possession of cocaine. Further, considering his attempts to discard and hide the cocaine after the fatal collision, a rational trier of fact could have concluded that defendant fled the traffic stop and initiated a high-speed chase specifically to avoid being caught with a substantial quantity of cocaine. However, defendant was entitled to a new trial because the court decided that the judicially created felony-murder instruction rule had to be abandoned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence on the felony-murder charge was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial because the judicially created felony-murder instruction violated Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3414(3)--the statute governing when a lesser-included offense instruction must be issued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of rape of a child under 14 years of age, aggravated criminal sodomy of a child under 14 years of age, and aggravated indecent liberties with a child after he sexually assaulted the seven-year-old daughter of his girlfriend and she disclosed to school officials that he was sexually abusing her. He then received a prison sentence of three life terms, with the third sentence to run concurrent to the first two life sentences. On appeal, he made three arguments: (1) his sentence violated the Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment; (2) his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated after a recorded video interview was shown at his preliminary hearing when the child victim was not there to be cross-examined; and (3) both his trial counsel were ineffective, depriving him of a fair trial. The state supreme court found that, as to the first two claims, relief was unavailable since he had not preserved those issues by making the required Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-404 specific objections at trial. It then found that as to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, he could not raise that issue for the first time on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case involving the use of a rail line as a recreational trail, appellants conservation groups appealed the judgment of the Miami District Court (Kansas) that found that the Kansas Recreational Trails Act (KRTA), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58-3211 et seq., was not preempted by 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1247(d), and did not violate any constitutional rights. Additionally, the court required the group to post a bond.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group argued, inter alia, that the KRTA imposed burdensome requirements that hindered the establishment of rail-trails in that there was a requirement that nongovernmental responsible parties provided a bond or an escrow account for costs associated with the management of rail-trails. The supreme court disagreed. Setting of a bond amount at $9,040 did not create a conflict with the National Trails System Act (Trails Act), 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1241 et seq. The KRTA's requirement that a bond be available to assure fulfillment of a trail operator's duties was related to the legitimate regulation of the use of the rail-trails and was an appropriate exercise of the state's authority to control safety, land use, and zoning related to rail-trails, an authority that was not expressly or impliedly preempted by the Trails Act. While there could be circumstances where the bond amount would be so onerous that it would conflict with the Trails Act, that situation was not presented. The requirement did not preclude the interim trail use or the ability to reactivate rail service in the future and, therefore, did not stand as an obstacle to accomplishing the objectives of the Trails Act.</SPAN></P>

His sentences were combined into an aggregate sentence of 8- to 30-years with a start date of November 8, 1990.

On August 1, 2008, the parole board informed appellant that his previous postincarceration supervision discharge date of June 26, 2009 had been extended to April 13, 2020 pursuant to the 2008 amendment to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4608(e). The Supreme Court of Kansas held that the 2008 amendment to Kan. Stat.

He received a consecutive 72-month prison sentence on one count and a 59-month sentence on the second count. The trial court also ordered that he be subject to lifetime postrelease supervision and lifetime electronic monitoring. The appellate court found that (1) he did not show a need for granting his motion for a psychological evaluation of the victim; (2) his convictions were not multiplicitous because the evidence showed a break in causality; (3) he did not properly preserve for review the issue of whether lifetime postrelease supervision under Jessica's Law was constitutional; (4) given the State's failure to prove defendant's age when the crimes occurred, he could not be subject to lifetime postrelease under Kan.

He claimed the State committed misconduct during closing argument, the trial court erred regarding the order in which it gave jury instructions, and the trial court lessened the State's burden of proof in instructing the jury as to criminal intent and premeditation. The state supreme court found that one of the State's remarks impermissibly requested victim sympathy and a misstatement of the law, but determined that the remark did not constitute plain error as it was made in passing, was not gross or flagrant, and did not change the verdict given the strong evidence against defendant. It also found that the jury was fully and accurately informed that it could consider lesser offenses regardless of the order of the instructions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Shawnee District Court (Kansas) entered a ruling in a declaratory judgment action that found that statutes the legislature had enacted to restrict the ownership of and public access to &quot;gray machines&quot; involved in gambling were not unconstitutionally vague and that injunctive relief was therefore not appropriate. Plaintiff game machine possessors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State enacted the Kansas Expanded Lottery Act (Act). The law authorized operation of certain gaming facilities, electronic gaming machines, and other lottery games at certain designated locations. Portions of the Act defined &quot;gray machines&quot; and outlawed ownership of and public access to such machines. The game machine possessors claimed that the provisions of the Act defining &quot;gray machines&quot; or allowing for enforcement of the Act regarding them were unconstitutional. The trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment and found that the statutes were not unconstitutionally vague. The state supreme court found that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-8702(g) (Supp. 2010) defining &quot;gray machines&quot; and the Act's enforcement provisions, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-8750(d) (Supp. 2010) and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-8761 (Supp. 2010), were not unconstitutionally vague, but were overbroad. It so concluded because it determined that the definition of &quot;gray machines&quot; allowed the State to confiscate almost any personal property without regard to its use and, thus, could allow for the unconstitutional taking of property not involved in the focus of the Act, which was the regulation of gambling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for review from the Kansas Court of Appeals' dismissal of defendant's sentencing appeal for lack of jurisdiction under the authority of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4721(c)(1). Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to consecutive presumptive sentences after his guilty pleas in two multiple-felony cases. He argued, in part, that the State violated due process by presenting false information during his sentencing hearing and that his sentence was disproportionate to his co-defendant's sentence. On review, the court determined that amendments to &sect; 21-4721(e) removed presumptive sentences from the ambit of appellate review. The only defendants permitted to appeal were those sentenced to an upward departure or those who received a downward departure but to a term longer than the one sought. Thus, defendant had to demonstrate that he was similarly situated to such defendants, which he did not, so his equal protection arguments failed. In addition, his characterizations of the application of &sect; 21-4721 as &quot;unfair&quot; and &quot;arbitrary&quot; did not constitute a sufficient due process argument; thus, defendant abandoned that issue on appeal. The court noted that a defendant believing there was a constitutional error with his presumptive sentence had recourse under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3504 or Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1507.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) of first-degree premeditated murder, rape, and aggravated arson. The court sentenced him to prison without the possibility of parole for 50 years (hard 50) for the murder conviction, 246 months for the rape conviction, and 61 months for the aggravated arson conviction, with all sentences to run consecutively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his murder conviction under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3401. The supreme court disagreed. Among other things, phone records and a witness's testimony placed defendant at or near the victim's house when she was killed. Defendant admitted finding the victim's body in the bathroom and placing his arm on her to check for signs of life. He testified that he either slipped or fell in the pool of her blood upon entering the bathroom. Nevertheless, the jury could reasonably have inferred that the presence of the victim's blood on the inside rear waistband of his jeans most likely would not have resulted from either of those innocent actions. Additionally, after discovering the victim's body, defendant did not call 911. He instead took numerous steps to conceal his presence at the scene. He removed his bloody clothes, cleaned her blood from his body, changed into other clothes, and hid his bloody ones, plus his lighter, in a pillow sham, which he then hid in a nearby dumpster. When he got to his mother's house he removed the second set of clothes, showered, changed into clean ones, and then hid the others in a bag.</SPAN></P>

The Butler District Court, Kansas, found the search lawful under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2501(c), which authorized searches incident to an arrest to discover evidence of a crime. While defendant's appeal was pending, the statute was found unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Kansas held that Fourth Amendment precedent compelled recognizing a good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule under Kan.

That exception was applicable for searches occurring before the court found &sect; 22-2501(c) to be unconstitutional. In the case at bar, a reasonable officer would not have known that &sect; 22-2501(c) was unconstitutional at the time of the search of defendant's vehicle and purse. The officer's objectively reasonable reliance on the statute was demonstrated by (a) the substantial case law precedent across the country upholding similar searches, which lent added facial validity to the statute; (b) an appellate court decision directly on point that was valid at the time of the search; and (c) the statute's legislative history.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver appealed a judgment of the Norton District Court (Kansas) that affirmed an administrative order of the Kansas Department of Revenue that suspended his driving privileges for one year following his arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) arguing that the officer lacked probable cause to arrest him and lacked reasonable grounds to believe that he had been operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the police officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the driver was operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol because he smelled alcohol upon his initial contact with the driver, he observed that the driver had watery and bloodshot eyes, the driver admitted to having consumed a few alcohol drinks that evening and admitted to having consumed his last drink approximately 30 minutes before being stopped by the police officer, the driver had difficulty performing a prefield sobriety test, the driver revealed two indicators of intoxication during the walk-and-turn field sobriety test and one indicator of intoxication on the one-leg stand field sobriety test. Those facts sufficiently established probable cause to proceed with a preliminary breath test, even if the statute authorizing it, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1001 (Supp. 2009), required only an officer's reasonable suspicion to administer the test. The officer's knowledge of those facts and circumstances created a reasonable belief that the driver was operating his vehicle under the influence of alcohol. As such, the suspension of his license was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court judgment affirming the administrative order suspending the driver's operating privileges was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a plea agreement on a charge of aggravated battery, the district court ordered an upward durational departure sentence without empaneling a jury to determine whether aggravating factors existed to justify the upward departure, as required by Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Kansas held that defendant did not make a constitutionally valid waiver of the right to have a jury determine whether aggravating factors existed to justify the upward departure because he was not informed of this right in the plea agreement or at the plea hearing. Although the district court informed defendant at the plea hearing of other specific rights he was relinquishing, and that the court could impose any legal sentence it deemed appropriate, the district court did not advise defendant that he had a right to a jury determination of the aggravating sentencing factors. Similarly, the written plea agreement only informed defendant of his right to have his guilt or innocence determined by a jury and the requirement that the State prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on each element of the charge. Neither of these provisions informed defendant he had a right to a jury determination of the aggravating sentencing factors. The failure to obtain a constitutionally valid waiver of defendant's right to a jury determination of the aggravating factors necessarily precluded the district court from conducting the upward durational departure proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kansas Court of Appeals entered a judgment that affirmed appellee Board's decision to award damages to appellant lessor after the lessor sought damages arising from the Board's decision to vacate two roads that provided access to the leasehold of the lessor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board decided to vacate two roads that provided access to the leasehold of the lessor. The lessor then filed a written application for damages with the Board. In reviewing the matter, the Board requested the attorney to advise as to damages and arguably help adjudicate, particularly with the drafting of the damage award order. After the award was made, the lessor claimed it was denied due process by the attorney's dual roles as the Board's legal advisor and as the Board's advocate. However, the trial and appellate courts affirmed the Board's damage award. The state supreme court first considered the standard that the lessor had to meet to show that the attorney's involvement was constitutionally infirm. It determined that while proof of actual bias was not required for a due process violation, the mere appearance of impropriety was insufficient. It then found that due process was violated when, under all circumstances of a case, a probable risk of actual bias was too high to be constitutionally tolerable. It determined that the attorney's participation in multiple roles presented such a due process violation and, thus, that a new damage hearing before the Board was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court reversed the judgment of the appellate court, the judgment of the trial court, and the decision of the Board, and remanded the case to the Board for further proceedings regarding damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Kansas Court of Appeals affirming his upward durational departure sentence for multiple sex crimes involving a child. The district court relied on the aggravating factor that defendant had a fiduciary relationship with the ten-year-old male victim. Defendant challenged both the process employed to determine the aggravating factor and the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the factor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court addressed the question of whether a new and separate departure jury could be impaneled after a guilty plea, i.e., after a waiver of the trial jury. The answer to that question was found within the provisions of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4718(b)(4). The court determined that the language in &sect; 21-4718(b)(4) could not have been more clear that a defendant's waiver of his or her right to a jury trial on the issue of guilt mandated that the court, not a jury, hear the evidence and make the factual findings on the existence of the asserted sentence-enhancing factor. The court found that the district court erred by impaneling a jury for defendant's upward durational departure sentence proceeding, following its acceptance of defendant's plea and trial jury waiver. However, defendant specifically declined to waive his right to a jury for the upward durational departure sentence proceeding, and, therefore, the district court was constitutionally precluded from following the statutory mandate for a court-conducted proceeding. Thus, defendant had to be sentenced without an upward durational departure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals affirming the district court and reversed the judgment of the district court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the district court erred by entering convictions for both aggravated indecent liberties with a child and rape of a child under 14 years of age because the information charged these counts in the alternative. The supreme court agreed. A defendant charged with more than one offense in a multiple-count complaint may be convicted of more than one offense. In contrast under State v. Dixon, where, as here, the defendant was charged in the alternative, he may be convicted of only one offense. The State attempted to distinguish Dixon by arguing it only applied when the charges were multiplicitous. But Dixon found that the jury did not need to deliberate on the lesser alternative charge if the defendant was convicted of the greater offense and the charges are multiplicitous. The supreme court found that rather than supporting the State's argument, this cut against it because it reiterated that a defendant can only be convicted of one of the alternative crimes when charged in the alternative. The district court appeared to partially understand this since it did not sentence defendant for aggravated indecent liberties with a child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Wyandotte District Court (Kansas) that convicted him of rape under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3502(a)(2), aggravated criminal sodomy, and aggravated indecent liberties with a child under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3504(a)(3)  involving his girlfriend's 12-year-old daughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the convictions of rape and aggravated indecent liberties with a child were not multiplicitous because the crimes did not share an identity of elements. Rape required sexual intercourse, while aggravated indecent liberties consisted of lewd fondling or touching with the intent to arouse or satisfy the sexual desires of the offender, the child, or both. Aggravated indecent liberties did not require sexual intercourse, and rape did not require the specific intent to arouse or to satisfy sexual desire. Because rape and aggravated criminal sodomy with a child under 14 years of age were off grid offenses when committed by a defendant 18 years or older, the trial court was required to instruct the jury to determine defendant's age as an element of the offense; the trial court's failure to do so, however, was harmless error because the evidence was undisputed that defendant was well above the age of 18. Defendant's 29-year-old son testified that he observed his father lying on top of the victim and that defendant was his biological father and that of his 31-year old sister. The evidence was thus undisputed that defendant was well over the age of 18.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a decision of the Kansas Court of Appeals that reversed defendant's conviction of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) to an extent that it rendered him incapable of safely driving a vehicle in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1567(a)(3) (Supp. 2009).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial, the arresting officer testified about defendant's failure of field sobriety tests. On review of his conviction, the appellate court reversed and remanded for a new trial, ruling that, although the officer's use of the words &quot;pass&quot; and &quot;fail&quot; was not improper, the State failed to lay the appropriate foundation for the admissibility of scientific evidence under the Frye standard. On review, the court held that the Frye test had to be met before admitting evidence establishing a relationship between a field sobriety test failure and a specific measurement of blood alcohol content (BAC). Because the State did not lay a proper foundation, the district court erred under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-456 in admitting the officer's opinion that, 68 percent of the time, a person exhibiting two indicia of intoxication has a BAC of more than.10. However, the trial court did not err in allowing the offer to use words like &quot;tests,&quot; &quot;pass,&quot; &quot;fail,&quot; or &quot;points&quot; because those words were commonly used by lay and expert witnesses to describe evidence that was not scientific in nature. Therefore, it was not necessary to meet the Frye test before those words were used.</SPAN></P>

On review of summary judgment granted in favor of the city, the court held that summary judgment was proper because the property owners failed to produce evidence showing the taking of existing access. Further, requiring the property owners to comply with city ordinances regarding driveways did not constitute a taking because a city's reasonable regulation of private property under its police power was not a taking and therefore did not require payment of just compensation. In addition, because the property owners failed to submit a completed application for a building permit, their claim that the city's failure to issue a permit constituted a taking was not ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured sustained a back injury in a slip and fall accident and underwent surgery. The hospital billed her insurance company more than $70,000 for the medical care provided but ultimately accepted less than $5,000 and wrote off the balance, which exceeded $65,000. The insured filed suit against the property owner, who filed a motion in limine asking that the district court prohibit the insured from claiming the full $70,000 as damages. The district court granted the motion and limited the insured's recovery for medical expenses to those amounts actually paid by her and by her insurance company. On review, the court held that the collateral source rule did not apply. Rather, the reasonable value approach to medical expenses remained valid, and the actual charges for medical care were not conclusive as to their reasonable valid. Rather, pursuant to Kan. Stat.

Although the professor was initially hired on the tenure track, the university notified the professor that it was not extending an employment offer for the 2001-2002 academic year. Grievance procedures were instituted following his termination; the Public Employee Relations Board (PERB) found that the university violated grievance protocols and ordered the university to cease and desist from prohibited practices, post a notice advising employees that it would not further interfere with their rights under the Public Employer-Employee Relations Act (PEERA), and awarded more than $140,000 to the professor in monetary damages. When the matter was appealed to the district court, the district court held that the PERB had authority to impose a monetary sanction, but the appellate court disagreed.

The supreme court disagreed and found that it could not conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a durational departure. The trial court indicated it had reservations about the plea agreement and continued sentencing to review preliminary hearing transcripts and have the defendant evaluated. At the sentencing hearing, after hearing arguments supporting the departure motion, the trial court made clear it had reviewed all the information in the record and could not conclude that the harm to the victim was any less than in any other case. He noted the mitigating circumstances that the defendant had little criminal history and that the State had supported the motion for departure as part of the plea negotiations, but concluded that the relationship of defendant to the victim was one of great trust, precluding him from finding that departure was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile pleaded nolo contendere in the Ellsworth District Court (Kansas) to misdemeanor possession of marijuana and stipulated to a extended juvenile jurisdiction sentence in exchange for the State dropping a &quot;felony charge.&quot; The State appealed on the question of whether a juvenile charged with a felony had the right to a preliminary hearing under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-2301 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that there was no statutory basis for ordering a preliminary examination in the juvenile proceeding, at the time that it was ordered. The supreme court agreed. The language utilized in the Kansas Juvenile Code suggested that a juvenile was not actually &quot;charged with a felony.&quot; Rather, the juvenile was charged with having committed an offense &quot;which if committed by an adult would constitute the commission of a felony&quot; under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-2302(n). Moreover, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-2304(a) clearly provided that proceedings concerning a juvenile were to be governed by the provisions of the Kansas Juvenile Code, not the Kansas Code of Criminal Procedure, except where specifically applied by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-2347 to adult prosecutions and extended jurisdiction juvenile prosecutions. Accordingly, there was no statutory basis for ordering a preliminary examination. Additionally, because an adult's right to a preliminary hearing was simply a statutory right, it could not be constitutionally required for a juvenile. Therefore, the district court erred in holding that the juvenile was entitled to a Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2902 preliminary examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with and convicted of sex offenses after engaging in sexual improprieties with his 13-year-old daughter. In his written statement to the police, defendant admitted that he and his wife had agreed upon a plan to drug and sexually abuse their daughter. He further admitted that he and his wife routinely used drugs, including methamphetamine. On review, the court held that the district court did not err in instructing the jury on the use of other acts evidence under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455. The instruction permitted the jury to consider evidence of defendant's use and possession of controlled substances solely for the purpose of proving defendant's plan and preparation and the nature of the relationships within defendant's family but precluded consideration of drug evidence for the purpose of criminal propensity or other prohibited used. The limiting instruction was proper because it limited consideration of the evidence solely in the context of the changing relationship between defendant and his wife, their subsequent plan to drug and sexual abuse their daughter, and their preparation and execution of that plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although a county appraiser recommended that appellant taxpayer receive an exemption from ad valorem taxation on real property that it owned and used for charitable purposes, appellee Kansas Board of Tax Appeals (BOTA) denied the application and denied the taxpayer's petition for reconsideration. The Court of Appeals (Kansas) affirmed BOTA's order. The taxpayer's petition for review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a public-benefit, nonprofit corporation that qualified for federal income tax exemption. It owned and operated an apartment building for chronically homeless, low-income people who suffered from severe mental handicaps and physical disabilities. The taxpayer's application was denied because it did not fit all of the statutory requirements for residential property exempt status under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201b, 4 (Supp. 2008). Although it was not disputed that the property was used for benevolent or charitable purposes under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201, 2 and 9 (Supp. 2008), BOTA and the appellate court concluded that &sect; 79-201b was the more specific statute and took priority over &sect; 79-201. The court overturned the denial of tax-exempt status. Because the plain language of both &sect; 79-201, 2 and 9 applied to the taxpayer's property, it was unnecessary to resort to statutory construction. Those provisions were not in conflict with &sect; 79-201b, 4. The court held that it was possible for property to qualify under &sect; 79-201, 2 and 9 without qualifying under &sect; 79-201b, 4, and vice versa. The statutes addressed different situations, and there was no conflict among them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed BOTA's judgment denying tax-exempt status. The court reversed the appellate court's judgment affirming BOTA. The matter was remanded to the State Court of Tax Appeals (Kansas) for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Sedgwick district court (Kansas) sentenced defendant to concurrent sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for 25 years and postrelease supervision for life pursuant to Jessica's Law, Kan.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In support of his motion for a downward durational departure under &sect; 21-4643(d), defendant stated that he was 63, had diabetes and hypertension, had no prior felony convictions, had a consistent employment history, and had a supportive family. Defendant also challenged for the first time on appeal his life sentences as a cruel or unusual punishment in violation of Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 9 or the Eighth Amendment. The court rejected the arguments. First, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion because it considered all of defendant's arguments, acknowledged the mitigating circumstances asserted by him, and explained why the cited factors were not substantial and compelling reasons to impose departure sentences. Second, the court held that because defendant made no effort to present the issue below of whether his Jessica's Law sentence was cruel or unusual, there were no findings of fact for analysis under the Freeman test for determining whether a sentence was cruel or unusual because of its length. Moreover, there was no showing that commitment under the Sexually Violent Predators Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-29a01 et seq., was an alternative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in its giving of an Allen-type instruction because it impermissibly pressured jurors to reach a unanimous verdict. The supreme court found that the giving of the instruction was error, but the error was harmless. The trial court erred in giving the deadlocked jury instruction. Nevertheless, the district court's decision was not reversible error. The evidence against defendant was substantial. There was no question that he was guilty of serious crimes against both the murder victim and his mother. As to premeditated first-degree murder, the defense conceded the intent to kill. Further, there was considerable evidence of premeditation, including defendant's gathering of weapons, his apparent plan to hold the murder victim against her will. Then, without knowing the murder victim was probably already dead, defendant &quot;knew what he had to do,&quot; meaning he had to get his chainsaw and use it on the murder victim. That included him going to his bedroom, getting the chainsaw, following the seven steps to start the chainsaw, and then using it. The evidence was also undisputed that defendant stabbed his mother multiple times.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Johnson District Court (Kansas) that convicted him of the attempted rape and capital murder of a 19-year-old college student, arguing that the charges of attempted rape and capital murder based on the aggravating crime of attempted rape were multiplicitous under U.S. Const. amend. V, Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 10, and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3107 and violated the prohibition against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that, because the capital murder charge was brought under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3439(a)(4), the State was required to prove the lesser offense of a sex crime--in this case, attempted rape. Thus, to prove capital murder, the State was required to prove that defendant intentionally and with premeditation killed the victim in the commission of, or subsequent to, the crime of attempted rape. As such, all of the elements of attempted rape were identical to some of the elements of the capital murder charge. Thus, the attempted rape was a lesser-included offense of capital murder. Under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3107(2), defendant could not be convicted of both capital murder under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3439(a)(4) and attempted rape under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 21-3301 and 21-3501, and imposing sentences for both convictions violated defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy. The court rejected defendant's further argument, however, that his reference to an attorney during the book-in process on an out-of-state charge constituted the assertion of his Miranda right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence imposed for the attempted rape conviction was vacated, but defendant's conviction and sentence for capital murder were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Board of County Commissioners of Wabaunsee County (Board) amended its zoning regulations to prohibit commercial wind farms in the county. Appellant landowners and appellant intervenors sought a judicial declaration that the Board's action in passing Wabaunsee County, Kan., Resolution 04-18 (July 12, 2004) was null and void. The Wabaunsee district court (Kansas) granted the Board's various motions to dismiss. Both sides appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners had written contracts for the development of commercial wind farms on their properties. Intervenors were the owners of wind rights concerning other properties. The Board amended its zoning regulations to permit only small wind farms and to ban large commercial wind farms because they negatively impacted county aesthetics, did not conform to the county's comprehensive plan, and the majority of the public opposed them. The court held that the landowners and intervenors did not establish that the Board acted unreasonably. First, a governing body with a super-majority was not required to return a recommendation to the planning commission for review under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-757(d). Second, the Board's rezoning to prohibit commercial wind farms in its entire county was a legislative action. Nevertheless, even utilizing the Golden reasonableness factors in quasi-judicial cases, the Board's findings could reasonably have been found to justify its decision. Third, the resolution did not violate the Contract Clause. Finally, neither the Kansas Electric Public Utilities Act nor the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 preempted the resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's judgment in large part and stayed several issues pending receipt of supplemental briefs and oral argument. The issues concerned the Takings Clause, the Commerce Clause, claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and inverse condemnation. The court denied the Board's cross-appeal arguing that the intervenors' appeal should be dismissed because their petition to intervene was untimely filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Rice District Court, Kansas, convicted defendant, pursuant to a guilty plea, of four counts of forgery in violation of Kan. Stat Ann. &sect; 21-3710(a)(1). The sentencing judge imposed a total fine of $325 on defendant's four counts. The Kansas Court of Appeals affirmed. Defendant petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that defendant's challenge to his fine was properly before it on appeal. Defendant argued that the word &quot;shall,&quot; as used in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3710(b), had to read as directory rather than mandatory. The supreme court found that its assessment of the substantive/procedural factors militated in favor of a mandatory reading. Prescription of a minimum criminal sentence was material; it was not simply a mode of procedure intended to secure order, system, and dispatch of the public business. Although consequences for noncompliance were implicit, they were real. A forgery sentence without a fine in some amount would be illegal under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3504 and subject to vacation and correction. The subject matter of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3710(b)(2)-(4) was not one in which the supreme court had an established pattern in its mandatory/directory precedents. Section 21-3710(b)(2)-(4) dealt with fines for forgery, and was controlling over Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4607(3), which dealt with criminal fines generally. When a legal argument advanced by a criminal defendant may or may not benefit all such defendants, the rule of lenity did not compel its acceptance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Franklin District Court (Kansas) that convicted him of aggravated criminal sodomy under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3502(a)(2), aggravated indecent liberties with a child under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3504(a)(3), and sexual exploitation of a child under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3516(a)(6), arguing that the district court erred in imposing sentence and that the evidence was insufficient to support the exploitation charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that defendant promoted the sexual exploitation of a child by displaying pictures that he took. At trial, however, the district court issued an instruction to the jury that permitted the jury to convict defendant if it found that he displayed or procured or produced a photograph that included the sexually explicit conduct by a child under the age of 14. On review, the court held that the instruction was clearly erroneous because the court could not be confident that the jury would have convicted defendant only on the basis of the single alternative theory charged and instructed upon. The wording of the complaint was binding on the State in pursuing its theory before the jury, and because there existed a real possibility that the jury would have rendered a different verdict if the district court had instructed it only as to displaying, the conviction could not stand. Further, the district court erred in imposing sentence. Aalthough defendant had two prior convictions for sex offenses involving minors, the two convictions on a single day constituted only one prior conviction event under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4642(c), even though they involved different victims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction for sexual exploitation of a child was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial of that count. The sentences for the remaining convictions were reversed, and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kansas Court of Appeals entered a judgment that reversed defendant's convictions for possession of methamphetamine and possession of drug paraphernalia after finding that defendant's right of confrontation was violated because the State pursuant to state statutory law admitted a forensic laboratory certificate of analysis without the testimony of the analyst. The state supreme court then granted the State's request for discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with, inter alia, possession of methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia. The State filed a pretrial notice of intent to admit into evidence a Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) laboratory analyst's certificate reporting forensic testing results. Before trial, defendant objected to any reports from the KBI being admitted into evidence without the forensic scientist being present in person. The trial court denied the objection. A jury found him guilty of both possession charges. The appellate court found that the forensic laboratory certificate, admitted pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3437, was testimonial and, thus, gave rise to Confrontation Clause rights under the Sixth Amendment. It then ordered that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3437(3) be struck in its entirety. The state supreme court found that a simple &quot;notice-and-demand&quot; statute would be constitutional. As a result, it also found that only the offending sentences in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3437(3), that defendant state grounds for an objection to the certificate being admitted and that the certificate still be admitted unless it met defendant's narrowly-defined, permissible objection, had to be stricken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court affirmed the appellate court's reversal of defendant's convictions, but reversed the appellate court's judgment nullifying the entire statutory provision in favor of severing the offending language. It also reversed the trial court's judgments of conviction. Too, it ordered that the case be remanded to the trial court with directions that a new trial be held.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the District of Nebraska certified a question of law in a legal malpractice case filed by plaintiff client against defendant law firm. The question asked whether an injector of natural gas into underground storage lost title to or possession of gas that migrated if the gas migrated before a certain date and that migrated gas was not captured or reduced to possession prior to that same certain date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client retained the law firm to represent the client in an action filed in the federal trial court in Kansas against an oil company. The client had injected natural gas into an underground storage field. Some of that gas allegedly migrated to other areas. The oil company then allegedly produced gas at its own wells that included gas that had migrated from the client's underground storage field. The client eventually sued the law firm for legal malpractice in the federal trial court in Nebraska and alleged that the law firm had not properly protecting the client's ownership interests in the migrated gas. The federal trial court in Nebraska certified a question to the state supreme court about whether Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55-1210, under which the client would retain its interest in the migrated gas, applied retroactively, that is, prior to its July 1, 1993 effective date. The state supreme court replied that the statute's substantive change to vested rights under the law could not be applied retroactively and, thus, the client did not retain an interest in the migrated gas where the gas migrated before the effective date of the statute and was not recaptured prior to that date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered guilty pleas to rape and aggravated criminal sodomy. The prosecutor argued several aggravating factors: (1) the nature of the abuse; (2) defendant's position of authority as the victim's stepfather; and (3) a medical finding that the victim had experienced an injury to her hymen. The district court ordered him to serve concurrent hard 25 sentences under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4643. In ruling on defendant's departure motion, the district judge orally reviewed the mitigating and aggravating factors, engaging in an appropriate weighing of the competing considerations. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. Defendant also asserted that the sentences under Jessica's Law were cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 9. The claim was not barred from appellate review even though defendant did not make an appropriate objection. However, the district court's silence did not supply a sound foundation for appellate review. The Supreme Court of Kansas was required to remand the matter for the district court to make additional findings under Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 16.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that, to establish a claim entitling them to relief under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1501, petitioners were required to show the lack of efficacy of the SPT program as to each of them. Because petitioners were admittedly noncompliant based upon their personal disagreement with the treatment program, their progress in the program could not be measured, and it could not be determined if petitioners, or either of them, would be able to successfully advance in and complete the program if they adhered to its requirements. Because petitioners admitted their noncompliance, the fact of noncompliance was uncontrovertible and subject to determination without an evidentiary hearing, and this was further true because their noncompliance was not based upon a legally justifiable basis such as shocking treatment. Because petitioners could not establish that the SPT program was ineffective as applied to them, the uncontrovertible facts established, as a matter of law, that there was no cause for granting the writ of habeas corpus. As such, the district court correctly dismissed the Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1501 petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Kansas Court of Appeals that affirmed a district court order denying her motion for postconviction relief under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1507, arguing that she was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel during her trial on a charge of first-degree murder for the killing of her abusive husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, while the court rejected defendant's argument that counsel was ineffective due to a conflict interest, the court agreed with defendant that she was improperly precluded from introducing evidence of counsel's advice to her. Defendant claimed that her attorney advised her that she could not be convicted of murder if she did not pull the trigger and that a judge would understand the legality of that argument better than a jury would; based upon the advice of her attorney, defendant waived her right to a jury trial. Because defense counsel died before the hearing on defendant's motion for postconviction relief, the district court precluded defendant from testifying regarding her counsel's statements by ruling that the statements were inadmissible hearsay. However, because defendant was not trying to prove that the matter asserted in the advice was true, and clearly the statements were incorrect under Kansas law, but was instead merely trying to demonstrate that counsel gave the advice and that the advice caused defendant to waive her constitutional and statutory rights, the statements were not hearsay under Kan.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Geary District Court, Kansas, dismissed criminal charges filed against defendant relating to allegations that he possessed cocaine. The charges were dismissed after the district court determined that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2902a, which authorized the admission of forensic laboratory reports at preliminary hearings, was unconstitutional because it violated the Confrontation Clause, U.S. Const. amend. VI. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the Confrontation Clause did not apply at a preliminary examination. The supreme court did not read Crawford as making confrontation a constitutional requirement at a preliminary examination. The federal constitution did not require a state to establish a procedure for the preliminary examination of probable cause that afforded the defendant the full panoply of constitutional rights which were applicable at a criminal defendant's trial. The Confrontation Clause did not apply to the admission of Kansas Bureau of Investigation laboratory reports at the preliminary examination. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2902a was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Shawnee District Court, Kansas, refused to consider the merits of appellant driver's petition after appellee State of Kansas Department of Revenue (KDR) suspended his driver's license, finding that the driver had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The Kansas Court of Appeals dismissed the driver's appeal, finding that he had failed to file a petition for judicial review of the KDR action in a timely manner. The driver appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver argued that the 10-day statutory time limit in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-259 (Supp. 2005) only applied to a petition for review of a hearing order which was entered upon the conclusion of the administrative hearing provided for in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1020. The supreme court found that looking first at Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-259(a), the suspension order subject to the 10-day rule was conditioned by a statutory reference to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1001 et seq. The statute referred to an order of suspension under any of the provisions of the implied consent law. The 10-day limit for filing a petition for review specified in &sect; 8-259(a) did not exclusively refer to the administrative hearing order. Section 8-259(a) applied to every order of suspension issued pursuant to the authority of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1001 et seq. The driver had 10 days from the effective date of the suspension, or until November 18, 2005, to file a petition for review. The petition, filed December 5, 2005, was untimely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Shawnee District Court (Kansas), which declined to follow a joint recommendation for departure and imposed the statutorily prescribed hard 25 life sentence under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4643 after defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated indecent liberties with a child under the age of 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In issuing its decision, the district court mentioned defendant's post-Miranda admission that he had sexually molested his daughter, which the district court had discovered was recorded in a law enforcement officer's arrest report affidavit. Defendant argued that his right to due process was violated by such reliance on the arrest report affidavit at sentencing, without affording defendant the opportunity to challenge its contents or requiring that the State prove the contents by a preponderance of the evidence. The court held that the district court could consider any circumstance which aids it in deriving a more complete and true picture of defendant's background, history, or behavior, and the use of such information, including other crimes for which defendant was neither tried nor convicted, did not in and of itself offend defendant's due process rights. At the sentencing hearing, the district clarified that the defense would have an opportunity to be heard, which included the opportunity to proceed with its argument and any evidence. The district court did provide a method by which defendant could effectively be heard and thus, comported with the due process clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
