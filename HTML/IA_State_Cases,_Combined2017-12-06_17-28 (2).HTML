</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A victim called 911 to report that she had observed a man standing on the side of the road with his pants down moving his penis in a circular motion. An officer then stopped a vehicle matching the description given. The victim later identified defendant as the man she had seen earlier. At trial, defendant made a hearsay objection to a deputy's testimony regarding the victim's identification. The trial court overruled the objection, defendant was convicted, and this appeal followed. In partially affirming, the appellate court determined that the descriptions of defendant and his truck provided by the victim were non-hearsay under Iowa R. Evid. 5.801(d)(1)(B) or (C). Evidence of a prior out-of-court identification of an accused was usually permitted. The victim testified before the deputy, and there was an implied suggestion that the identification of defendant and his truck were the result of improper influence or motive or her memory was not clear. However, the trial court erred by prohibiting defendant from having no contact with minors for a period of five years. This portion of the sentence was unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

Appellant communicated with his friends and family members in English and prior to his arrest, he was involved in running a business at a shopping mall  Appellant could not prevail on his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim based upon his trial attorneys' failure to advise him of the immigration consequences of a conviction.

The Department cross-appealed the denial of its motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student, who was legally blind, sought training in Braille and computer skills but was not permitted to participate with her guide dog; she was offered, inter alia, individual instruction at her home. The student was not entitled to a new trial because the jury instructions given incorporated the law on providing services in a segregated setting outside of the Department's regular training program. A requested instruction on offering alternative training correctly stated the law under 28 C.F.R. &sect; 35.130(d), (e), but the law did not apply to the facts of the case as the student was admitted to full participation but rejected it; all other blind participants were not permitted to use a guide dog either. Summary judgment was properly denied to the Department as Congress had validly abrogated its immunity as a State entity with respect to the ADA claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12202. Congress acted within its authority under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 5 because the limited remedies available under the ADA were congruent and proportional to the goal of preventing unconstitutional discrimination against disabled individuals in public education.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders on both appeal and cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

There was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant's conviction for violating the residence restriction because that was a strict liability offense. However, the State failed to prove defendant had the necessary mens rea to violate the registration law. There was insufficient evidence defendant knew or should have known of the duty to register a change in residence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer's expert witnesses applied an absorption rate to discount the value of the lots by adjusting the market value to account for the length of time it would take for the lots to be sold. The assessor's expert witness testified as to the market value of the lots without an absorption discount, stating that the market price already accounted for the availability or unavailability of buyers. The district court considered the application of an absorption discount but concluded that the evidence presented by the taxpayer's expert witnesses was highly speculative. The court held that the use of an absorption discount was not appropriate in determining assessed valuation for property tax purposes. Under Iowa Code &sect; 441.21(1)(b) (1993), market value was defined as the fair and reasonable exchange in the year in which the property was listed and valued between a willing buyer and a willing seller. Thus, the presence of a willing buyer and a transaction occurring in the year in question both had to be presumed for assessment purposes. An argument that the district court lacked authority to increase property valuations, asserted for the first time in a reply brief, was waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father sought review of an order of the Iowa District Court for Polk County, granting appellee mother's motion to dismiss the father's motion to vacate the guardianship of their son, the ward. The father had challenged the fact that the mother did not name, in her guardianship petition, the father as a custodian as required by Iowa Code &sect; 633.552 and that she did not provide notice to him in accordance with Iowa Code &sect; 633.554(b)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed her petition for guardianship seven days before the ward's eighteenth birthday. The petition failed to state that the father was a joint custodian. The father learned of the guardianship ten days after the mother was appointed. On appeal, the court decided, contrary to the holding of the district court, that the father was an interested party and his interests were not represented in the guardianship. The father had a strong bond with the ward, had custody of him fifty percent of the time at the time the petition was filed, and provided him financial support. In the mother's petition, she misrepresented to the district court that she alone was the ward's custodian when at that time she only shared custodial responsibilities with the father. Neither did she mention the father at all. Those false and inadequate representations allowed the mother to be named guardian of the ward without notice to the father as required by &sect; 633.554(b)(1). A judgment entered without proper notice was generally considered void and could be attacked at any time. Therefore, the father's application to vacate the guardianship did not have to comply with Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.1013.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order establishing the mother as guardian and remanded to the court to consider the petition for appointment of guardian after notice to the ward, his attorney, the mother, and the father.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The withdrawal of blood was an intrusion of one's bodily security, and the threat of force was important to an analysis of a consent search. However, defendant did not challenge that probable cause existed for the warrant, which was obtained because his refusal to consent was honored by the officers. Where a search warrant was sought to authorize an intrusion into the human body, the court must determine not only whether officers had probable cause, but must weigh other factors, including the risk to the suspect and the extent of the intrusion on the suspect's interest in personal privacy and bodily integrity. However, once the warrant was issued, a suspect's interest in safety, dignity, and privacy were not furthered by a requirement that officers possess or display the warrant authorizing the search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Iowa District Court for Emmet County to possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Defendant was sentenced to probation, which was later revoked. Defendant was then sentenced to ninety days in jail and his probation was extended. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court lacked the authority under Iowa Code &sect; 908.11(4) to extend his probation. The court of appeals agreed. The State argued, inter alia, that defendant failed to comply with the court-ordered restitution plan, and thus the district court had the power to extend his probation pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 910.4(1)(b). According to the State, at the time of the probation revocation hearing, defendant continued to owe $ 553 in restitution. However, the problem with that argument was that the district court did not find defendant in violation of his restitution obligations. In fact, defendant appeared to have been ahead of the payment schedule, at least in regards to his primary obligation. At the time of the revocation hearing (only nine months into his payment plan), defendant had already paid $ 1522 of his primary restitution obligation and had only $ 403 left. The legislature gave the district court four alternatives for addressing probation violations, at least when the violation involved something other than failure to pay restitution. Therefore, the district court lacked the statutory authority to extend defendant's probation by two years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two year extension of probation was reversed. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by trial information with one count of willful injury causing serious injury under Iowa Code &sect; 708.4(1). A jury for the Iowa District Court for Polk County found him guilty of the lesser included offense of assault causing serious injury under Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 708.1 and 708.2(4) (2007). He was sentenced to be imprisoned for a term not to exceed five years. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testimony from the witnesses supported the victim's contention that defendant approached his property, threatened him, and then proceeded to punch and kick him. Given the evidence presented, a jury could find sufficient evidence demonstrated that defendant instigated or provoked a fight, or had the ability to retreat at any point during the altercation, but failed to do so. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal, as sufficient evidence was presented for the jury to decide that the State proved each element of assault causing serious injury beyond a reasonable doubt including by the same standard, negating defendant's justification defense under Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 704.3 and 704.6. The undisputed injuries included damage to the victim's left orbital socket, requiring reconstructive surgery, severe bruising on his liver and thigh, and severance of his intestine from his colostomy bag. Thus, under Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 902.3 and 902.9, the severity of the five-year sentence was not cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment as it was not grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the crime committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa District Court for Polk County convicted defendant, upon his guilty plea, of two counts of lascivious acts with a child under Iowa Code &sect; 709.8(1), (2), and (3) (2003). After defendant's sentence had been vacated and remanded to the district court for resentencing, a different judge than the one who originally sentenced defendant imposed a sentence of two five-year terms of imprisonment, to be served consecutively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the imposition of consecutive sentences demonstrated vindictiveness in sentencing. The district court's statements reflected that it carefully weighed the sentencing options and decided to impose consecutive sentences for logical, non-vindictive reasons, including for the protection of the public and to ensure that defendant would continue rehabilitation efforts. Thus, his vindictiveness claim failed. Also, the district court's statements that it was imposing consecutive sentences because it was concerned about protecting the public and that defendant needed more time than he would served pursuant to a concurrent sentence arrangement to continue his rehabilitation met the requirement in Iowa R. Crim. P. 2.23(3)(d) that the district court had to disclose on the record its reasons for selecting a particular sentence. Further, the district court stated generally it had considered the victim impact statements, but there was nothing to demonstrate that the district court specifically relied upon the alleged abuse of the victim's sister and the mother's reference to other offenses in her statement was vague, oblique, and fleeting. Thus, the sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Iowa District Court for Linn County found defendant guilty of homicide by vehicle while any amount of a controlled substance was present under Iowa Code &sect; 707.6A(1) (2009); homicide by vehicle while attempting to elude under Iowa Code &sect; 707.6A(2)(b); operating a motor vehicle without the owner's consent under Iowa Code &sect; 714.7; and possession of a controlled substance under Iowa Code &sect; 124.401(5) (2009).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 8, the officers had a reasonable basis to conduct protective searches of defendant's clothing and purse because she had been involved in a reckless, high-speed attempt to elude the officers prior to an accident and the officers could have reasonably expected she might continue her attempt to escape the authorities by using weapons on her person or in her purse. Also, during the initial search of her clothing, defendant was not immobilized because she was not yet on a backboard. In addition, the search of the purse was justified because defendant could have used a weapon therein against the unarmed paramedics. Thus, the district court did not err in denying her motion to suppress the evidence seized incident to the search of her clothing and purse. Defendant's statements to the paramedic were not privileged under Iowa Code &sect; 622.10(1). Trial counsel was not ineffective under the Sixth Amendment in failing to object to the admission of the results of the urine test based on implied consent under Iowa Code &sect; 321J.6. Defendant's motion for directed verdict of acquittal on the first homicide by vehicle count was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial, the Iowa District Court for Plymouth County found defendant guilty of identity theft in violation of Iowa Code &sect; 715A.8 (2007). On appeal, defendant argued that: 1) the State did not present sufficient evidence to prove that he was guilty of identity theft; and 2) his counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that &sect; 715A.8 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police responded to complaints of noise and possible underage drinking and began checking identifications. Defendant identified himself as his brother to avoid arrest on an outstanding warrant. On appeal, the court disagreed with defendant's argument that &sect; 715A.8(2) only applied when someone fraudulently used another's identification information to obtain a financial benefit. Looking to the word &quot;benefit&quot; in the statute, it was clear that a benefit was any form of advantage. Defendant attempted to gain the advantage of not being arrested under the outstanding warrant in his own name. The court concluded that the State presented substantial evidence to support the district court's verdict that defendant was guilty of identity theft. However, due to an absence in the statute of a means to determine the level of offense, the district court's designation of the crime as an aggravated misdemeanor was not supported by substantial evidence. Defendant's overbreadth argument was waived because he failed to explain what First Amendment right was violated, and his counsel had no duty to raise a vagueness challenge to the statute because it was not vague as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of identity theft, it reversed the designation of the crime as an aggravated misdemeanor, and it remanded the case to the district court for a finding of the level of the offense and, if necessary, resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1920, a family built a house. From approximately 1920 to the late 1940s, this family provided room and board to African-American students attending Iowa State University when the students were denied housing elsewhere. The street on which the house was built was designated as a commercial zoning district. The home, which was rental residential property, was permitted as a nonconforming use. The court concluded that plaintiffs failed to prove they were denied due process when the city designated the house as a historical landmark. Plaintiffs' protected public interests were not immediately implicated in the designation of a neighboring property as a historical landmark. The city's procedure was adequate to protect plaintiffs' interest in maintaining property values and neighborhood aesthetics. There was no equal protection violation by the designation. The two properties were not treated differently as a result of the designation. The city's rezoning of the house did not constitute illegal spot zoning. The property was a permissible nonconforming use and the objective sought by the rezoning, historic preservation, was within the city's police power.</SPAN></P>

Appellee city council conducted a hearing, but there was no record of the hearing and no written decision on the notice of violation or the request for an exemption. The owner then sought injunctive relief. The request for a permanent injunction was denied, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the ordinance at issue was not unconstitutionally vague based on the word &quot;environment&quot; in the definition of a &quot;conservation area.&quot; The owner did not negate every reasonable basis upon which the ordinance could have been sustained. A mayor chose and applied one of several reasonable definitions of &quot;environment.&quot; A statute was not unconstitutionally vague because a key word was not specifically defined. A challenge to the city council's action was not reviewed due to a lack of a record. Finally, a claim of procedural irregularity in the adoption of the ordinance was not properly submitted to the trial court; therefore, no error was preserved on this issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual abuse of two children. The trial court imposed two consecutive sentences totaling 35 years in prison. The trial court denied his application for postconviction relief. On appeal, the court found that the admission of one victim's recantation testimony would not likely change the result if defendant was granted a new trial. There were sufficient discrepancies, unusual departures, and changes of testimony in the story the victim told at the postconviction hearing from which the trial court could have concluded that her testimony at the time of trial, and not at the hearing, was the true statement of the events that transpired. Further, counsel was not ineffective for not objecting to the marshalling instructions for second- and third-degree sexual abuse. It was quite unlikely that a jury would have found that defendant performed the sex acts but did not act knowingly and intentionally in so doing. Finally, the consecutive sentencing statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 901.8, was not unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner challenged a decision from the Iowa District Court for Allamakee County, which granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, a county and a board of adjustment, in a zoning dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was ordered to stop construction because he did not comply with a zoning ordinance relating to setbacks. The owner contended that the ordinance did not apply to his property located in a private subdivision. He also argued that his property was not a corner lot required to have a side-yard setback. He also challenged the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the Allamakee County, Iowa, Zoning Ordinance explicitly applied to private roads. Nothing in Iowa Code ch. 335 limited the application of a zoning ordinance to public streets. Therefore, it did not matter whether the bordering roads were public or private. Next, the owner's argument that his property was not a corner lot was rejected. Under the ordinance, in order for a thoroughfare to qualify as a street, it had to afford the principal means of access to an abutting property. Therefore, both lanes at issue in this case were streets, even though they were also cul de sacs. Finally, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. When examined in the context of common understanding or practice, the definition of a street included a cul de sac.</SPAN></P>

III, &sect; 29 was untimely and reversing the commissioner's determination that &sect; 85.34(7) was inapplicable to his workers' compensation claim because his prior work injuries occurred before the statute's effective date. The appellate court agreed with the district court that the employee's constitutional challenge was not timely. Codification of legislature cured any defect in the subject matter or title. The amendments to Iowa Code &sect; 85.34(7) were enacted and made effective on September 7, 2004. The employee did not file his workers' compensation petition until January 2006. His single-subject challenge was thus untimely. The employee did not have a right to institute and maintain a claim for benefits from two successive work-related injuries until his right shoulder injury occurred, despite the existence of his prior injuries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowner sought review of a decision of the Iowa District Court for Floyd County granting appellee tax deed holder's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the homeowner's petition against the holder and appellee county treasurer. The homeowner's petition had alleged that she had not received actual notice of a tax sale or of her right to redemption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Iowa Code &sect; 447.9 authorized the holder to serve the homeowner with a notice of redemption by both regular mail and certified mail to her last known address. The homeowner maintained this provision violated her due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 9, because it did not require actual delivery of notice and was therefore unconstitutional. The summary judgment record in this case did not reveal a failure of notice. The holder simultaneously sent its notices by certified mail and by regular mail and there was no indication that the regularly mailed notice came back as undeliverable. Because the holder used two notification methods calculated to apprise the homeowner of her redemption rights and learned that only one of them failed, due process did not require it to take additional steps to notify the homeowner. Although Iowa Code &sect; 447.9 also deemed notice effective upon mailing, the fact that two notices were required and were sent in this case, and the fact that the homeowner's property rights would not immediately have been affected, rendered this statutory scheme as applied to the facts of this case constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a parental rights termination case, appellant minor children sought review of an order of the Iowa District Court for Woodbury County, which held that the children could not object to the transfer of jurisdiction to a tribal court pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 232B.5 (2009), a provision of the Iowa Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), Iowa Code &sect; 232B.1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children argued that the transfer was not in their best interest and that the Iowa ICWA was unconstitutional. The trial court did not consider the merits of their objection and denied the children's motion to amend or enlarge, refusing to address their constitutional arguments. However, the children were parties to, and had a vital interest in, the transfer proceedings. Therefore, the children were entitled to a voice at every stage of the proceedings, but were denied an opportunity to be heard. By not including the children as parties able to make an objection, the Iowa ICWA violated their procedural due process rights. Therefore, &sect; 232B.5(10), (13) was unconstitutional on procedural due process grounds. Further, a fundamental interest was implicated and &sect; 232B.5 completely prohibited the children from asserting their rights, such as their preference to remain with siblings or their physical or psychological safety. The narrow definition of good cause prohibited the children from objecting to the motion based upon their best interests. Thus, &sect; 232B.5(13) violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 9, on substantive due process grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter for a hearing on the transfer motion, during which the children shall be allowed to object and the children shall be allowed to introduce evidence of their best interests.</SPAN></P>

The Iowa District Court for Pottawattamie County awarded title of the property to the City, and the homeowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner's house was rendered uninhabitable by fire.

The property was unoccupied for more than six months and, after the fire, the property did not meet housing code requirements for human habitation, Iowa Code &sect; 657A.1(1) and Iowa Code &sect; 657A.10A(3)(c), (d), and the utilities had been shut off shortly after the fire, &sect; 657A.10A(3)(b).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant used force creating a substantial risk of death or serious injury to the victim and supported his conviction of second-degree sexual abuse where defendant choked his victim until she lost consciousness and raped her. The emergency room physician who treated the victim testified that, as a result of being choked, the victim had bruising on her neck and around her eyes, that the choking was severe enough to cause the blood vessels around her eyes to rupture and bleed underneath the skin, and that, in order to cause the injuries from choking, defendant had to have used a severe amount of force, which could have been life threatening. This evidence was sufficient to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by asphyxiation, or a lack of oxygen caused by the strangulation, and the evidence demonstrated that, when defendant strangled the victim so that she lost consciousness, he used force that created a substantial risk of serious injury or death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of public intoxication, on defendant's claim that the underlying statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 123.46(2) (2007), was unconstitutional, was denied by the Iowa District Court for Poweshiek County. The Iowa Supreme Court denied defendant's application for discretionary review. Following a trial to the district court on the minutes, defendant was convicted of public intoxication, second offense, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant in a convenience store. Defendant admitted he was intoxicated and knew it was illegal, but refused to submit to sobriety testing, and the officer arrested him. Defendant alleged the statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 123.46(2), was unconstitutional. Even if one of the alternative means of violating &sect; 123.46(2), simulating intoxication, could have been interpreted as restricting free speech as shown by actions, application of overbreadth principles would result only in partial invalidity of the statute. Defendant was convicted of actual intoxication in public. This fell within the statute's plainly legitimate sweep, and defendant's overbreadth argument was rejected. The statute provided sufficient guidance to law enforcement personnel so that they could understand what conduct was prohibited and it did not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement; therefore, the statute was not vague. Defendant summarily claimed his sentence was disproportionate to his crime; he failed to meet the threshold of gross disproportionality, particularly because he was not sentenced to any jail time and his fine was one-sixth of the maximum fine, plus surcharges and costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, two parents and their three children, sought review of a decision of the Iowa District Court for Polk County, which, based on a jury verdict, entered judgment for appellees, a driver and a rental car company, in a suit alleging negligence for personal injuries sustained by the father when the rental car skidded on an icy highway and struck him, and for negligent infliction of emotional distress as to the rest of the family.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Icy patches intermittently covered the road on the day in question. Appellants had pulled off the road to help a stranded car. The other driver averred that he had adjusted his speed for the ice; that as he neared the stranded car, the cars ahead of him began sliding and zig-zagging; and that to avoid hitting them, he tapped his breaks and lost control of his car, which slid directly into the stranded car and the individuals standing nearby. In ordering a new trial, the court found that since the district court had eliminated the legal excuse defense from the case, there was no basis for the jury to have exonerated the driver from a finding of negligence. The district court also erred in not granting jury instructions on legal excuse and sudden emergency since it was for the jury to decide whether the driver's violation of the rules of the road was excused by the unforeseen circumstances of the ice and the vehicles in front of him. While only the mother's emotional distress claim should have been submitted to the jury, the court also found that the rental company should have been dismissed because the Graves Amendment, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106, preempted state law in this matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the rental company should have been dismissed from the case and reversed and remanded the case for a new trial on appellants' negligence claims against the driver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to assert that &sect; 903B.1 violated the federal and state constitutional provisions regarding substantive due process, U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 9. He argued that the imposition of extended parole following incarceration under &sect; 903B.1 infringed upon his fundamental rights to liberty, privacy, and freedom from governmental restraint. The court held that as a parolee, defendant had no fundamental liberty interest in freedom from extended supervision, and he had a limited expectation of privacy. Therefore, the court applied the rational basis test to determine whether &sect; 903B.1 violated defendant's due process rights. Because there was a reasonable fit between the State's interest in protecting its citizens from sex crimes and the special sentence imposed by &sect; 903B.1, that section was not unconstitutional. Defendant's counsel's assistance was not ineffective for failing to raise a meritless claim.</SPAN></P>

He also argued that the sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that a case decided after defendant's appeal controlled as to the equal protection and separation of powers claims, and thus, those claims failed. Defendant's procedural due process claim did not stem from the imposition of the &sect; 903B.1 sentence. Rather, defendant claimed that if he violated the rules of parole and his release was revoked, the statute contemplated additional proceedings that were not specified. Because defendant had not violated any terms of his extended parole, this issue was not ripe for review. His substantive due process claim was rejected because the State had a rational interest in protecting its citizens from sex offenders. Section 903B.1 was not grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offenses to which it applied, and its imposition did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court concluded any issues raised in defendant's pro se brief were not preserved for appellate review, were waived for failure to cite authority, or were otherwise not properly before the appellate court. Under Iowa Code &sect; 903B.1, defendant was not being punished for &quot;crimes not committed&quot; but rather for third-degree sexual abuse. His sentence had not been served; the special sentence was part of his sentence that he was currently serving. A challenge to the statute based on future parole violations was not ripe. Iowa Code &sect; 903B.1 was not grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offenses to which it applied and its imposition did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The registration requirement pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 692A.2(1) was not punishment. Because it was not punitive, its imposition together with the special sentence did not add to the punishment imposed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Iowa District Court for Louisa County to sexual abuse in the third degree. The district court imposed an indeterminate sentence not to exceed ten years, suspended the sentence, and placed defendant on probation. Pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 903B.1 (2007), the court also imposed a special sentence of life-time supervision. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, age 26, had sexual intercourse numerous times with the 14-year-old victim, resulting in her becoming pregnant with twins. Iowa Code &sect; 903B.1 required that certain sex offenders be committed into the custody of the Department of Corrections for life. Defendant argued that &sect; 903B.1 violated the separation of powers doctrine, the due process clause, and the equal protection clause and constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that a case decided after defendant's appeal controlled as to the equal protection and separation of powers claims, and those claims failed. Section 903B.1 was not grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offenses to which it applied, and it did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant's procedural due process claim was that if he violated the rules of parole and his release was revoked, the statute contemplated additional proceedings that were not specified. Because defendant had not violated any terms of his extended parole, this issue was not ripe for review. His substantive due process claim was rejected because the State had a rational interest in protecting its citizens from sex offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

The owner was convicted on both charges. The State filed an in rem forfeiture complaint seeking forfeiture of the handgun. The State did not utilize the notice of pending forfeiture administrative process, and the owner responded by filing a motion to dismiss. The trial court denied the owner's motion to dismiss, and gave the owner thirty days to file a claim for the property and answer to the State's complaint. After the owner failed to file either an answer or a claim as authorized by the trial court, the State applied for a forfeiture order, which was entered. The appellate court ruled that the owner's failure to move to set aside the default judgment did not constitute an appellate waiver. The default judgment was a final judgment, and all final judgments could be appealed. Also, the trial court's default judgment was proper. The owner had the benefit of the trial court's specific order allowing him thirty days to answer the State's in rem complaint, and he elected not to file an answer.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found no violation of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment under either U.S. Const. amend. VIII or Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 17. Section 903B.2 was not grossly disproportionate to the acts of committing the crime of indecent exposure and subsequently violating parole terms. Further, given that there was a rational basis for the legislature's inclusion of indecent exposure within &sect; 903B.2, the court was not at liberty to declare the classification unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 903B.2 rationally advanced the State's objective in protecting its citizens from sex crimes. Thus, trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise the meritless claim that the statute violated defendant's right to equal protection of the law.

The State appealed, and defendant cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that blood test results obtained from a warrantless withdrawal of defendant's blood should have been suppressed because defendant was not under arrest at the time of the withdrawal, as required by Iowa Code &sect; 321J.10A(1), even if there was probable cause. The record also did not support a warrantless search under the emergency provision of Iowa Code &sect; 321J.10A(1)(c). The court also held that the destruction of the blood sample did not warrant dismissal. There was no Brady violation because the State's failure to inform the lab of defendant's request that the evidence be preserved appeared to be an oversight rather than intentional; the sample was then destroyed pursuant to the lab's usual procedure; and there was no evidence that the blood sample was exculpatory in any way. Further, given the State's lack of bad faith in destroying the blood sample, the district court erred in dismissing the criminal charges against defendant based on its conclusion that the destruction of the blood sample deprived defendant of a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of defendant's motion to suppress the blood test results obtained from the warrantless withdrawal of her blood, affirmed the holding that defendant did not establish bad faith in the failure to preserve the blood sample, reversed the finding that the right to a fair trial was violated by the destruction of the blood sample, and reversed the dismissal of the criminal charge. The court remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed. The State conceded that the record before the district court did not disclose the age of the victim of the sexual abuse offense for which defendant was convicted in 1995 and, thus, that defendant &quot;has been convicted of a criminal offense against a minor.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced and the Iowa District Court for Story County awarded them joint legal custody of their children, with appellee mother having primary physical care, and divided the marital property. Appellant father was given visitation every other weekend, ordered him to pay child and medical support for the children, and denied him an alimony award. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the father contended the district court should have awarded the parties shared care of their two children; the district court did not use the proper incomes in computing child support; the medical support provision needed modification; the property division was not equitable; and he should have been awarded alimony. The appellate court agreed that the medical support provision needed supervision to comply with Iowa Ct. R. 9.12. However, the appellate court disagreed with the father on all remaining issues. The court's district's primary reason for its custody decision was that the parties had different attitudes towards discipline, and the mother more closely monitored the children's rules and enforced them. The appellate court found  no basis to rely only on average past years' income to determine income for child support purposes because, in the current economy, the mother's past income would not continue in the future, and her ability to continue at past income levels was not likely. Thus, there was no basis to decrease the father's child support. Similarly, denial of alimony was proper as it was most likely that the mother's income would continue to decrease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's medical support obligation was increased; as modified, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate was convicted and sentenced for possession with intent to deliver, drug tax stamp, delivery of controlled substance, and conspiracy to commit a felony. When he refused to give a DNA sample for DNA profiling, defendant State filed a contempt action. Defendant Iowa District Court for Jones County found the inmate in contempt and ordered him imprisoned until he provided a DNA sample. The inmate petitioned for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the inmate contended Iowa Code ch. 81 did not apply to individuals like him who were convicted and sentenced before ch. 81 was enacted, and that even if ch. 81 did apply retroactively, the district court's order that he &quot;shall be imprisoned until he provides a sample of his DNA&quot; violated ex post facto laws. The inmate also argued that he should have been granted a jury trial. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that, by its terms, Iowa Code &sect; 81.1 applied to any person against whom a judgment or conviction for a felony had been entered. The inmate was such a person. While the inmate's refusal to submit a DNA sample led to additional incarceration, it was the violation of the DNA profiling law which carried its own penalty that triggered that result. The effects of ch. 81 were not punitive to any significant extent. The initial burden, that of providing an oral swab, was de minimis; and the burden imposed on those who refused to meet that burden was the well-recognized sanction of contempt. Thus, ch. 81, as applied to the inmate, did not violate ex post facto laws. Finally, no jury trial was required as the contempt proceeding was civil in nature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's order was upheld and the writ of certiorari was annulled.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the petition for involuntary annexation was properly approved by the CDB. On appeal, the court found that the trial court's ruling was well reasoned and fully supported by the record. The city development committee did not err in concluding there was not a &quot;substantial&quot; amendment to the annexation that would trigger a continuance under Iowa Code &sect; 368.18 (1997). The original petition filed in June 1998 involved the annexation of approximately 8,890 acres. The amended petition removed acres that had been voluntarily annexed between the original petition in 1998 and the 2005 hearing: the parties affected by the voluntary annexations were aware of those proceedings. No territory was added. The trial court did not err in dismissing petitioner's request for declaratory relief because the allegations of procedural irregularity in the special election approving the annexation proposal should have been made in a separate election contest under Iowa Code ch. 57 and 62.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The realtor brought an action against the seller of a sports bar to recover a real estate commission based on an alleged oral brokerage agreement. The realtor asserted claims for breach of contract, a violation of equitable doctrines, constitutional violations, and fraud. The trial court granted partial summary judgment and dismissed the contract, equity, and constitutional claims. The trial court awarded judgment to the seller on the fraud claim. On appeal, the court found that substantial evidence supported the trial court's finding that the realtor had mistakenly believed that a buyer had been procured by him as a prospective buyer for the seller's business. The realtor failed in his heavy burden of proving that Iowa Admin. Code r. 193E-1.42 had no rational basis to a legitimate government interest, exceeded the real estate commission's authority, or constituted an unjust taking. The weight of the evidence established that the seller stood ready to pay the realtor a 10 percent commission if, in fact, he procured a buyer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that trial counsel was not rendered ineffective by failing to object to the jury instructions for murder in the second degree, in part because there was sufficient evidence to support submission of the theory that defendant was the principal. The evidence included that defendant harbored a strong dislike for the victim, had threatened to shoot him, owned a.22 caliber semi-automatic rifle, which he took to the victim's residence, and entered the residence with another individual. The victim was killed by a.22 caliber bullet to the head. The court also held that the prosecutor did not commit prejudicial misconduct by characterizing defendant's conduct as callous, stating that defendant had the ability to stop the murder and did not, stating that defendant was deceitful and had lied, or using argument to personally vouch for State witnesses and express a personal opinion as to evidence and guilt. Therefore, counsel did not breach an essential duty by not objecting. Finally, appellate counsel was not rendered ineffective by failing to challenge on direct appeal the trial court's overruling of hearsay objections to admissible evidence.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the district court did not err in holding that the parents' claims premised upon the civil liability provisions of Iowa Code &sect; 232.75(2) (2005) were subject to the provisions of Iowa Code ch. 670 as the teacher and the principal were acting within the scope of their employment when they allegedly failed to report the alleged abuse. Further, and the continuing tort doctrine did not apply to the teacher's and the principal's alleged failure to report because, even if the parents' injury was continuing in nature, there was only a single act of omission. However, the appellate court agreed with the parents that where no notice was given, Iowa Code &sect; 670.5 (2005) violated the Iowa and United States equal protection clauses when read to omit the minor tolling provision of Iowa Code &sect; 614.8(2); there was no rational basis justifying the classification resulting from claims filed by minors against a municipality and claims filed by minors against private tortfeasors. As such, the summary judgment should not have been granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the State of Iowa, appealed a judgment from the District Court for Polk County (Iowa), which, in a jury trial, ruled that sovereign immunity did not bar plaintiff employee's claims against the State under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and made an award to the employee that included damages and interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was terminated after notifying a public employer that she was receiving medical treatment. The district court found that Eleventh Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XI, immunity did not bar the suit. The court stated that Congress unequivocally intended to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity as to the FMLA when it explicitly provided in 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2617(a)(2) that employee lawsuits for money damages could be maintained against any employer, including a public agency. The court concluded that the FMLA's self-care provision, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2612(a)(1)(D), was a valid exercise of the constitutional power authorized by U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 5, and that immunity was therefore properly abrogated as to the self-care provision. The court noted that the legislative history indicated that Congress was attempting to alleviate the disparate impact of serious illness on women wage earners. Because the self-care provision was enacted to alleviate gender discrimination, a heightened standard of review applied. The State's actions in providing FMLA leave pursuant to Iowa Admin. Code r. 11-63.4 and informing employees of their FMLA rights amounted to a waiver of sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was born and raised in Mexico. The employee was married to the claimant and had five children. The employee travelled to the United States for work, and regularly sent the claimant money. While living and working in Iowa, the employee married the spouse, and had one child. The employee was killed in a accident while working, and the spouse and claimant each applied for survivors' benefits. The deputy commissioner allocated 50-percent of the death benefits to the spouse and twenty percent to her child. The remaining 30-percent was assigned equally to the claimant and her children, resulting in them actually receiving 15-percent due to the effect of Iowa Code &sect; 85.31(5) (2005). The appellate court ruled that the deputy did not err in its equitable apportionment of survivors' benefits. The record showed that the employee contributed approximately 15-percent of his annual earnings to support the claimant and her children, which was the percentage of benefits her family would ultimately receive under the agency's allocation. Also, as nonresident aliens, the claimant and her children did not have standing to assert their constitutional challenges to Iowa Code &sect; 85.31(5).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants established a one-bedroom bed and breakfast in their single family residence believing under the city's zoning ordinances it was a small home occupation, a permitted use in a R-1 residential zone. The city disagreed and charged the claimants with violation of its zoning ordinance. The claimants sued seeking a declaratory judgment declaring their bed and breakfast a permitted use, and asked that a writ of mandamus issue compelling the city to cease interfering with the lawful use of their property. The claimants were found guilty of a municipal infraction and their request for relief was denied. The appellate court ruled that the claimants' one bedroom bed and breakfast was a permitted use under the R-1 zoning ordinance. It was the size of the occupation that defined what was permitted in R-1 districts. There was nothing in the ordinances to support a finding that a small home occupation was precluded from being classified as a small business because it was permitted in another zone. A one bedroom bed and breakfast was clearly the smallest of small, and the only conclusion the appellate court could reach was that it was a permitted use under the R-1 ordinance.</SPAN></P>

It was undisputed that neither child was a member of the Tribe, nor were their fathers members of the Tribe. The State filed CINA proceedings as to the two children. The juvenile court denied the Tribe's motion to intervene in the CINA proceedings. The Tribe alleged that the children were Indian children within the meaning of Iowa's Indian Child Welfare Act (Iowa ICWA), Iowa Code chapter 232B (2007). The Tribe argued that Iowa Code &sect; 232B.3(6) had not been declared unconstitutional on its face. The appellate court disagreed with Tribe's assertion. The appellate court ruled that it was proper form the juvenile court to deny the Tribe's motion to intervene. The Iowa ICWA's definition of &quot;Indian child&quot; found in Iowa Code &sect; 232B.3(6) was unconstitutional because it included ethnic Indians who were not eligible for tribal membership. Consequently, the appellate court must apply the Federal definition of &quot;Indian child&quot; to determine whether the Federal or Iowa ICWA applied to the case. The children were not members of the Tribe. The children were not eligible for membership in the Tribe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to purchasing his agricultural land, the owner did not consult an attorney, review the abstract, or obtain a title opinion to determine if any use restrictions were applicable. The owner intended to build a large metal pole building, in which he would reside, store his personal belongings, and work on old cars. He later discovered that the land he purchased was within the county's agricultural land use district. The county board of adjustment denied the owner's application for a variance. The trial court dismissed the owner's petition for a writ of certiorari and upheld the denial of a variance. On appeal, the court found that the board made sufficient factual findings. Although written findings were not made, the board's reasoning and conclusions were included in the reported and transcribed hearing, thus facilitating review of the board's action. The county agricultural land preservation ordinance was in effect at the time the owner purchased the land. He did not acquire a use contrary to the existing agricultural classification. Accordingly, the court found no merit to the owner's claim that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff carjacking victim brought an action against defendant city in the Iowa District Court for Pottawattamie County, contending he was injured as a result of city police officers' negligence. The district court granted the city's motion for summary judgment after making a finding the officers were making an emergency response and entitled to immunity under Iowa Code &sect; 670.4(11) (2005). The victim appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, his girlfriend, and a friend were carjacked by a man with a gun. The victim drove to his girlfriend's parents' house to get money for the carjacker. Once in the house, the girlfriend called 911 and stated that the carjacker had a gun and that her boyfriend was in the car. Police arrived. The victim got the gun away from the carjacker and shot him in the head. The officers commanded him to put hands up and drop it. The officers then fired their guns nearly 20 times. The victim, still in the car, was seriously injured by the shots. The court held that Iowa Code &sect; 670.04(11) (2005) was unambiguous, providing no basis to explore its legislative history. Because the victim's claim was based upon an act or omission in connection with an emergency response by officers carrying out their official duties, the officers were entitled to immunity under the statute. There was no evidence that the officers intended to harm the victim, and there was no opportunity for deliberation. Therefore, the officers' conduct did not shock the conscience sufficiently to support a claim under U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the city.</SPAN></P>

The applicant also sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal court contending the state court unreasonably applied federal constitutional law in addressing his claims. The petition was denied. The applicant initiated the present action by filing a pro se motion for correction of illegal conviction and sentence. The appellate court ruled that the denial of relief was proper. The district court did not err in treating the applicant's motion as an application for postconviction relief. The applicant argued that his sentence was automatically illegal if his conviction was illegal, and this type of challenge was to be made by initiating a postconviction relief proceeding under Iowa Code &sect; 822.2(1)(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder and had a long history of sexual assault. Near his release date, appellee State filed a petition under Iowa Code ch. 229A to have him committed as a sexually violent predator. The Iowa District Court for Winnebago County declared the patient to be a sexually violent predator and committed him to the care of the Iowa Department of Human Services. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the patient contended, inter alia, that the State failed to prove whether he was both dangerous and possessed a mental abnormality that made him likely to engage in sexually violent predatory acts at the time of commitment and that the trial court erred in admitting irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial evidence by way of expert testimony and actuarial risk assessment as to his projected risk to reoffend 5, 10, and 15 years into the future. The appellate court disagreed, holding first that the district court did not err in overruling the patient's request for a directed verdict as there was no temporal element required under Iowa Code ch. 229A. Further, the risk assessments in question were relevant to the essential question of whether the patient was more likely than not to commit a sexually violent offense if he was not confined in a secured facility. The appellate court found that the actuarial instruments, while measuring future reconviction rates, assisted in understanding this essential question. These assessments were part of a larger clinical analysis that took into account a variety of other factors. Thus, admission of this evidence was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant served his sentences for third-degree burglary, assault with intent to commit sexual abuse, false imprisonment, and fourth-degree criminal mischief, he sought to discharge his probation or modify the conditions. The Iowa District Court for Dallas County denied defendant's request, finding that the purposes of probation had not yet been fulfilled. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant raised several issues challenging the district court's denial of his application to discharge or modify the conditions of his probation, including the requirement that he participate in a sexual offender treatment program. The appellate court found that although the district court discussed much of the information defendant presented in his application, nothing in its ruling changed the burden of proof, as he contended. As the current burglary conviction for which he was on probation arose from the same incident in which he was convicted for assault with intent to commit sexual abuse, there was a reasonable relationship between defendant's required participation in the sex offender treatment program and the statutory purposes of probation for his burglary conviction. Although he had previously successfully completed a relatively short probationary period, he subsequently committed more criminal offenses, including with the same type of assaultive conduct, which resulted in his incarceration and current probation. Thus, not enough time had passed to determine whether rehabilitation efforts had been successful.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the district court erred in admitting the breath test results taken with the DataMaster device because the State failed to lay an adequate foundation. The State satisfied the foundational requirements for the admissibility of breath test results, under Iowa Code Ann. &sect; 321J.15, because the DataMaster device was approved by the Commissioner of Public Safety and because a certified operator administered the test and followed the approved testing procedures. Defendant also argued that the district court erred in permitting expert testimony of a criminalist concerning the formulas used in obtaining a breath test result. Defendant was not prejudiced by the expert testimony, which was admissible under Iowa R. Evid. 5.702, 5.703, 5.704.

The appellate court disagreed, finding first that the amendment to the statute did not extend the length of incarceration on its face. Further, appellant failed to prove that the change in law from conducting yearly personal interviews to only reviewing an inmate's case file each year produced a serious risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to an inmate's crime. This lack of proof, coupled with the parole board's discretion to grant interviews in any given case, made appellant's ex post facto claim speculative.

The court disagreed because defendant unequivocally asserted that the sentence imposed on him was not authorized by the statutes in effect at the time the abuse began. The sex acts to which defendant pled guilty began before July 1, 1996. Therefore, there was a period of time from April 9, 1996, to June 30, 1996, before which Iowa Code &sect; 902.12 (2003) became effective. The district court concluded that, under the circumstances, it had to presume that the entry of judgment may have been based on pre-July 1, 1996, acts. Since &sect; 902.12 did not take effect until July 1, 1996, application of the statute to defendant was unconstitutional, and therefore, illegal. The court discerned no error in the district court's reasoning.</SPAN></P>

When asked if he had been drinking, defendant responded, &quot;not a whole lot.&quot; Defendant failed field sobriety tests. On appeal, defendant contended the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress and that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to assure his waiver of jury trial was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. Defendant maintained that the city ordinance with respect to noise was void for vagueness; however, a plain reading of the ordinance defined the offense with sufficient definiteness such that an ordinary person could easily understand what conduct was prohibited. As to whether trial counsel was effective, counsel failed to ensure substantial compliance with the requirements of Idaho R. Crim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual abuse in the third degree, and sentenced to a period not to exceed ten years. The State filed a motion for resentencing. The Iowa District Court for Black Hawk County resentenced defendant to add a lifetime parole provision in accordance with Iowa Code &sect; 903B.1 (Supp. 2005). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In August 2006, defendant pled guilty to one count of third-degree sexual abuse and one count of lascivious acts with a child. The amended trial information alleged that the acts occurred between June 1, 2005, and August 27, 2005. The charges were brought after defendant's girlfriend reported to the police that she believed defendant had sexually assaulted her seven-year-old daughter. Defendant argued that resentencing him to lifetime parole under Iowa Code &sect; 903B.1 (Supp. 2005) was an illegal sentence. The appellate court ruled that the mandatory sentencing enhancement required by Iowa Code &sect; 903B.1 could not legally be imposed upon defendant. The imposition of mandatory lifetime parole was not effective until July 1, 2005, and it could not be used as a sentence for criminal acts committed before July 1, 2005. It was neither proven that defendant committed the act after July 1, 2005, nor did he specifically plead guilty to committing the act after July 1, 2005. For acts committed before July 1, 2005, imposition of lifetime parole was discretionary under Iowa Code &sect; 903B.1(3) (2005).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resentence was vacated and remanded for reinstatement of the original sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father appealed from the District Court for Pottawattamie County (Iowa) the termination of his parental rights, claiming that the trial court erred in finding clear and convincing evidence that he failed to support his children without good cause according to Iowa Code &sect; 600A.8(4) (2005) and in finding that termination was in the best interests of the children. He made additional constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After going to prison for using a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct, the father failed to pay child support; however, his actions did not manifest indifference to his children. He attempted to maintain a relationship with his daughters by calling them twice every month and sending letters and small gifts to them on a weekly basis. He only earned $ 17 per month in prison, $ 14 of which he used to pay for phone calls and letters to the children. Good cause existed for his failure to contribute to the children's support. Therefore, the evidence was inadequate to terminate his parental rights under &sect; 600A.8(4). Although it was specific to the case as it was passed due to the lobbying efforts of the maternal grandmother, &sect; 600A.8(10) was inapplicable to the father as there was no express language that it was to be applied retroactively. Although it may have been in the best interests of the children for their father's parental rights to have been terminated, any such analysis was not reached because no grounds for termination were established by clear and convincing evidence. The children would be adequately protected under the divorce court's orders.</SPAN></P>

Defendant initially claimed that while he was running a bath for his son, the water temperature suddenly surged, causing the burns. He subsequently claimed that he had instructed his four-year-old stepdaughter to run a bath for his son and that she ran the water too hot. Witnesses for the State testified that it was unlikely that the son's injuries could have occurred from the situations described by defendant. Affirming, the court held that the jury was entitled to credit the State's witnesses over defendant's testimony and that even if the jury had believed defendant, it could have found him reckless in asking a four-year-old child to run a bath for his son. The court preserved for postconviction review the claim of ineffectiveness with regard to the jury instructions and overruled the claim with regard to the constitutionality of &sect; 726.3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners argued that &sect; 358.16 violated the due process clauses of the United States and Iowa Constitutions because it allowed annexation of property without notice. The court concluded that the statute did not require the district to provide notice to property owners affected by the annexation prior to annexation. The annexation procedure set forth in &sect; 358.16 did not violate the owners' due process rights. The district, as owner of 25 percent of the property to be benefitted by the annexation, was allowed by statute to petition for annexation. Section 358.16 made no distinction between public and private owners of land. The statute allowed the district to require the owners to connect to the district's sewer system upon annexation of their property. Although the county board of health issued a permit to the owners for an on-site waste water treatment system, the board specifically stated it had no intent to affect the ability of the district to compel connection to the sewage treatment system. The county board of health was divested of its jurisdiction after the owners' property was annexed by the district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to have children temporarily removed from appellant mother's custody. The Iowa District Court for Linn County granted an ex parte removal order. Following a hearing held within 20 days of the order, the juvenile court modified a prior dispositional order that had authorized placement of the children with the mother. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother contended that: (1) she was denied due process by having her children removed from her custody ex parte without a subsequent removal hearing within 10 days pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 232.78, and (2) the juvenile court erred in ordering a modification on less than clear and convincing evidence of changed circumstances. The appellate court held that Iowa's statutory scheme for protecting the rights of natural parents in termination proceedings was constitutional, and that it was implicit in the power of the juvenile court in monitoring its prior child-in-need-of assistance (CINA) orders to temporarily, even summarily, remove a child pending a hearing on the modification. In other words, Iowa Code &sect; 232.78 did not provide the only authorization for summary removal when a child was already under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under a CINA order. Also, there was clear and convincing evidence to support the district court's finding of a change of circumstances warranting modification because the mother admitted to smoking marijuana or consuming alcohol on several recent occasions and she could not explain a number of &quot;misoccurred&quot; alcohol tests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a fuel truck operator, injured his right shoulder when he slipped and fell from an excavator. On appeal, the court affirmed the commissioner's award of benefits under Iowa Code &sect; 85.36 because: (1) the commissioner properly based the employee's compensation rate on a 60-hour work week because the employee testified that he worked 60 hours a week at a minimum and that one week he worked 110 hours; and (2) the court rejected the argument that a layoff of an indefinite length projected to occur at some unknown time in the future required a different calculation than the one based on 13 weeks of preinjury actual earnings. The commissioner did not err by concluding that the employee had reached maximum medical improvement (MMI) under Iowa Code &sect; 85.34(1) on August 28, 2001 because two treating physicians specifically found that he had reached MMI on that date and continued him on indefinite restrictions. Substantial evidence also supported the agency's determination that the employee was not able to return to work in May 2001 due to his restrictions. The agency's award of penalty benefits under Iowa Code &sect;&nbsp;86.13 was also affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that he was not subject to the jurisdiction of the city's mandatory connection ordinance, that the franchise and mandatory connection ordinances did not apply to him, and that the ordinances were not authorized by statute. The court found no merit to any of these arguments. With respect to the owner's argument that the ordinances were an unconstitutional exercise of municipal power, the court concluded that the restraints imposed on the owner did not unconstitutionally deprive him of valuable property interests. The owner would receive a new on-site system for little or no initial cost, and the monthly charge to utilize the system was reasonable. The owner would still have the use and enjoyment of his property, limited only by the existing need to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The requirement that the owner allow a rural water district to come onto his property was not a taking within the meaning of the Iowa or United States Constitutions. Mandatory compliance with the city's sewer ordinances was a reasonable means by which to protect the health of the community.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2006, the Iowa Supreme Court issued its decision in the case of State v. Heemstra. That case significantly altered the existing felony-murder rule. The Iowa Supreme Court made the new felony-murder rule applicable to all prospective cases and all cases pending on direct appeal, but specifically chose not to make the modification retroactive. The applicant filed his pro se PCR application on September 8, 2006. The applicant claimed the PCR court should reverse his first-degree murder conviction because the original trial court's jury instructions were improper in light of the Heemstra decision. The applicant also claimed the Iowa Supreme Court's decision not to make Heemstra retroactive violated his constitutional rights. The instant court concluded that the Iowa Supreme Court's decision not to make the Heemstra rule retroactive fell within the general rule that state courts have the authority to determine the retroactivity of their own decisions. The instant court found no merit to the applicant's claim that his PCR counsel was ineffective because she did not find more issues to challenge beyond those raised in the current PCR petition.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that his constitutional right to due process was violated by requiring him to bear the burden of rebutting the statutory presumption that he should be placed on the sex offender registry. The appellate court ruled that appellant failed to preserve the issue for appellate review, and also waived the issue on appeal. In appellant's written argument to the juvenile court he made no clear argument that the Constitution had been violated by placing this burden upon him, but instead argued he had met the burden. Also, appellant argued on appeal that Iowa Code &sect; 692A.2 wrongly punished and treated juvenile delinquents the same as adult criminals by subjecting them to the sex offender registry; however, he failed to make this specific argument to the juvenile court. While appellant generally argued the Iowa Legislature was irrational in applying the law to juveniles, he provided the appellate court with no legal standard for it to be judged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the amendment of the information against the inmate because in a drug trafficking case, a conspiracy charge amendment effectively added a new means of committing the same offense and was permissible. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the addition of witnesses in the amendment because he received notice of the amendment 11 days before trial, which gave him ample time to adequately prepare a defense in response to the amendment. Counsel testified that he discussed the option of seeking a continuance with the inmate and that he rejected the option. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the initial seizure of defendant as illegal because the officer had reasonable cause to make an investigatory stop, as viewing a stopped car in the country at two a.m. gave the officer reasonable cause to believe a driver may have needed assistance. Seeing a group of persons using the inmate's property also supported a reasonable suspicion of trespass.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa District Court for Polk County he pled guilty to one count of sexual exploitation of a minor, and the other four sexual exploitation of a minor counts were dismissed. The district court accepted defendant's guilty plea and placed him on probation for two years. As part of its sentencing order, the a no-contact order was entered. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the district court erred in imposing a no-contact order pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 901.5(7A) as part of his sentence because the order was not authorized by statute. The appellate court found that because defendant claimed the no-contact order was not authorized by statute, his failure to raise the issue of sentencing error at the time of sentencing did not constitute a waiver of his right to raise the issue on appeal. The appellate court agreed with the State that the district court was authorized under Iowa Code &sect; 907.6 to define reasonable probation conditions; however, &sect; 907.6 did not authorize creation of a condition of probation that could result in criminal prosecution under Iowa Code &sect; 664A.2 (Supp. 2005) as &sect; 664A.2 did not list Iowa Code &sect; 728.12(3) as a triggering offense. Therefore, the no-contact order was not authorized pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 664A.2 or Iowa Code &sect; 907.6. And although the trial court had justification to impose a condition of probation that restricted defendant from engaging in most communication with minors, there was no justification for forbidding him from incidental communication with minors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That portion of the sentence containing the imposition of a no-contact order under Iowa Code ch. 664A was reversed, and the case was remanded to the district court for entry of the restrictions on communication and contact with minors as conditions of probation and for clarification of the restriction on communication with minors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found defendant not guilty on October 31, 2005. On November 22, 2005, the court ordered him to reimburse the State for the total costs of his legal assistance pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 815.9. Defense counsel filed a motion challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 815.9. After granting a hearing on the motion, the district court dismissed the constitutional challenges and ordered the payment plan. On appeal, defendant argued: (1) Iowa Code &sect; 815.9 (2005) was unconstitutional; and (2) he was denied effective assistance of counsel at the reimbursement hearing. Regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 815.9, the Court of Appeals of Iowa held that the instant case was similar case to State v. Dudley. The issues in the instant appeal were fully discussed and decided in Dudley. The court found the reasoning in Dudley persuasive and the authority cited in the case controlling. Therefore, the court of appeals refused to address the same issues in the instant case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa District Court for Wayne County ordered defendant to reimburse the State for the total cost of his legal assistance pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 815.9 (2005), after he was acquitted of criminal charges. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 815.9 and, in the alternative, requested a payment plan. The district court overruled the constitutional challenges to the statute and entered a payment plan order. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 815.9&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated his constitutional rights to equal protection and due process, and that his counsel in &sect; 815.9 proceedings was ineffective. The statute did not violate equal protection because it did not eliminate any of the exemptions available to civil debtors. The provision for the repayment of costs and fees in reasonable installments if reimbursement was not timely made required the district court to consider defendant's reasonable ability to pay. Furthermore, defendant was not required to reimburse the State for costs that were assessed to a convicted indigent defendant. Thus, &sect; 815.9 provided protections that were not afforded to other judgment debtors or to convicted indigent defendants. Section 815.9 survived defendant's procedural due process attack because defendant was afforded a hearing and he was provided with adequate notice of his responsibility to reimburse the State for his court-appointed attorney fees. Defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were without merit because, as an acquitted indigent defendant, he was not constitutionally or statutorily entitled to court-appointed counsel in &sect; 815.9 proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner appealed a decision of the Iowa District Court for Hamilton County, which granted a motion to dismiss and summary judgment to defendant water district for various claims in the owner's pro se action to void the district's application under Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 6B.3, 6B.4 for condemnation or to quiet title for an easement claimed by the district to install and maintain a water pipeline across the owner's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner claimed that an easement was not necessary and that the district had not complied with the requirements of Iowa Code &sect; 6B.3(a)(b) by showing the location of the right-of-way sought to be condemned, and failed to provide notice under Iowa Code &sect; 6B.2A(2). On review, the court affirmed the decisions. The district court properly dismissed under Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.421(1)(f) the owner's due process claim because a pre-determination hearing was not required and the owner took substantial steps to alert the district court of his objections and resistance to the condemnation. It was not improper to deny the owner's motion to amend to include a claim that the description of the easement was nonsensical because on its face the claim appeared legally ineffectual. The district was entitled to summary judgment on the issue as to whether the condemnation was necessary under Iowa Code &sect; 6A.1 because it presented evidence to show that the site selected for the pipeline was reasonable, which was all that was required. Because the owner's affidavits and response were untimely under Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.981(3), he presented no evidence to show that the selected site was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The evidence was sufficient for the trial judge to find that defendant did not have authorization from the owner to use the social security card.

The appellate court found that the statute was not unconstitutional as it did not violate equal protection. The daughter's available contribution was $7300. By subtracting from the in-state tuition of $15,852 and dividing by two, the appellate court came to the father's contribution: $4276. The father was responsible for a postsecondary education subsidy but the amount was modified from $5000 to $4276.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord advertised for a resident manager to collect rent and perform maintenance. An applicant for the position, who was not hired, filed a complaint with the Commission alleging the landlord engaged in housing and employment discrimination based on the applicant's race and marital status. The claimed violations were premised on the City's Human Rights Ordinance. While the administrative action was pending, the landlord sued the City and the Commission. The landlord reached a settlement of the administrative action and that action was dismissed with prejudice. In light of the settlement, the district court concluded the civil action with the City and Commission was moot. The landlord argued that the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding that the settlement and dismissal of the administrative action rendered his claims moot. The appellate court agreed with the district court that the case was moot. The landlord's entire lawsuit was premised on the discrimination complaint filed with the Commission.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa District Court for Woodbury County denied appellant offender's motions for directed verdict in which he argued that the language of Iowa Code ch. 229A required proof of a more immediate risk to reoffend than the actuarial numbers presented by the State and thus the State failed to show he was presently more likely than not to reoffend if not confined. The offender was civilly committed as a sexually violent predator and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender contended that the State failed to prove he was presently more likely than not to engage in a sexually violent offense if not confined in a secure facility as required by Iowa Code &sect; 229A.2. Both parties presented expert testimony to the jury on the offender's likelihood to reoffend and thus whether he met the statutory definition of a sexually violent predator. Some of the evidence showed that his lifetime risk to reoffend was 52%. There were several factors that suggested the 52% was low including the fact that since his first conviction for a sexual offense there had not been a period of time of more than a few months where he had been free and had not reoffended, as well as his failure to complete a structured sexual offender program. Perhaps the most compelling evidence presented that the 52% likelihood to reoffend was low was that the actuarial instruments used actually measured recidivism by using rates of reconviction for sexual offenses rather than using rates of reoffending. The jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender was presently more likely than not to reoffend if not confined to a secure facility as required by &sect; 229A.2.</SPAN></P>

An officer was dispatched to the area, and he observed defendant leaving the parking lot in the vehicle. Although he did not observe defendant violating any traffic laws, he stopped the vehicle. Defendant was subsequently arrested for OWI, and he filed a motion to suppress based on the legality of the stop. The district court denied his motion, and defendant sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;8 were not violated since the community caretaking exception applied. There was a three-prong test to determine if this exception applied. First, there was a seizure when the stop was made. Second, the police officer was conducting a bona fide community caretaker activity because defendant could have had a medical problem that the officer was unable to ascertain just by following him for a few minutes. Finally, the public need and interest required the officer to determine defendant's condition. This need and interest outweighed the minimal intrusion on defendant's rights.</SPAN></P>

The student sued the district for judgment for injuries that she suffered when she put her hand and wrist through a glass door at a high school.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa Supreme Court had held that Iowa Code &sect; 614.8, which extended the statute of limitations in Iowa Code ch. 614, did not apply to toll statutes of limitation outside of Chapter 614.

Because &sect; 670.5 remained a valid statute of limitations, Iowa Code &sect; 614.8 did not apply to toll the two-year statute of limitations in Iowa Code &sect;&nbsp;670.5. The student failed to file suit within two years of the notice of claim. Thus, her suit was untimely and summary judgment was properly granted in favor of the district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the district court abused its discretion by imposing DNA profiling as a part of sentencing. Defendant alternatively claimed that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to argue that mandatory DNA profiling violated (1) the constitutional proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and (2) his right to equal protection of the laws. The appellate court rejected defendant's arguments. Iowa Code ch. 81 (Supp. 2005) required the district court to order DNA profiling because defendant, a felon, was sentenced after June 14, 2005. Counsel breached no duty in failing to assert an equal protection challenge, because all felons were subject to DNA profiling and the statutory provisions authorizing DNA profiling for convicted felons were rationally related to legitimate government purposes such as identifying perpetrators of future crimes and exonerating the innocent. Counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise the search and seizure issue, because the DNA profiling statute did not authorize unreasonable searches in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The impoundment of animals did not violate procedural due process as the individual had received oral notice of the impoundment of his dog and written notice of the city's intention to forfeit the dog through adoption. He also had a hearing before the city's board of health. The individual was not entitled to notice of the right to redeem his dog as the dog had been impounded under City of Council Bluffs, Iowa, Ordinance &sect; 4.20.030. The impoundment did not violate substantive due process given the director's authority to take actions as he deemed appropriate. Section 4.20.030 was not preempted by state law because Iowa Code &sect; 364.3(3) allowed a city to set more stringent standards and requirements unless otherwise provided by state law and there was no state law prohibiting a city from allowing for forfeiture in a simple misdemeanor case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Buchanan County, K. D. Briner, Judge. A defendant appeals from the sentence imposed following his guilty plea to one count of lascivious acts with a child.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant entered a guilty plea to one count of lascivious acts with a child, the Iowa District Court for Buchanan County sentenced him to an indeterminate five-year term of confinement, to be followed by two years of special release.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended two-year additional term constituted an illegal sentence because it exceeded the maximum sentence allowed under Iowa Code &sect; 902.9(5), the general indeterminate sentencing statute, and conflicted with the definitions of &quot;parole&quot; and &quot;work release&quot; found in Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 904.901, 906.1. The appellate court disagreed, finding that defendant's sentence was clearly authorized under Iowa Code &sect; 709.8 (2003). Moreover, there was no basis for defendant's claim that the trial court imposed a sentence above and beyond the statutorily authorized maximum. Even if the two statutes were irreconcilable, the specific provisions of &sect; 709.8 prevailed over the more general provisions of Iowa Code &sect; 902.9. In either event, the trial court did not impose an illegal sentence. Even if the conflict between the statutes was sufficient to create a latent ambiguity, that ambiguity alone was not a basis for invalidating the statutory sentencing scheme. As the disputed portion of Iowa Code &sect; 709.8 (2003) was more specific than the general parole and work release provisions, and was enacted subsequent to those provisions, it prevailed.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, review of a doctor's testimony indicated that the use of the term &quot;predatory&quot; was preceded by a recitation of the factual elements of that term.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Iowa District Court for Webster County, which denied his motion to suppress evidence and convicted him of possession of marijuana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of a search of his home, defendant was charged with drug-related crimes. The case was referred to the Iowa Department of Revenue and Finance to collect taxes due on the drugs. The charges against defendant were dismissed. Nearly six months later, the Department obtained an administrative warrant to search defendant's residence and seize any item to satisfy the tax. As officers were executing the administrative warrant, they noticed the odor of marijuana. After a search warrant was obtained, officers discovered marijuana. Defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana. On appeal, the court held that Iowa Code &sect;&nbsp;453B.9 (1997) did not violate the constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. The primary factor militating in favor of upholding the tax warrant was its characterization as an administrative warrant, designed specifically and solely for the collection of a tax debt. As an administrative warrant, a finding that a crime had been committed was not required. When the court balanced the State's need to collect a tax due on the possession of illicit drugs against the invasiveness of the search, the State's interests prevailed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Iowa District Court for Polk County, which sentenced him for 10 counts of sexual exploitation of a minor, Iowa Code &sect; 728.12(3) (2001), and one count of lascivious acts with a child, Iowa Code &sect; 709.8 (2001).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court sentenced defendant to confinement and further ordered that, upon completion of defendant's confinement, he was sentenced to an additional term of parole or work release not to exceed two years. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that the additional term constituted an illegal sentence because it exceeded the maximum sentence allowed under Iowa Code &sect; 902.9(5), the general indeterminate sentencing statute, and it conflicted with the definitions of &quot;parole&quot; and &quot;work release&quot; found in Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 904.901 and 906.1. The additional term of parole or work release was imposed pursuant to &sect; 709.8 and was therefore authorized by statute.&nbsp;Section 709.8, which dealt with sentencing for the particular crime of lascivious acts with a child, was more specific than the general sentencing provisions of &sect; 902.9. The court concluded that the two provisions could be given concurrent effect. Even if the two statutes were irreconcilable, the specific provisions of &sect; 709.8 would prevail over the more general provisions of &sect; 902.9. Lastly, the court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 709.8 was unconstitutionally void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The forfeiture proceedings stemmed from the owner's participation in an attempted marijuana transaction, where the owner acted as look-out for his cousin. Following the owner's arrest, officers seized the owner's truck. The owner pled guilty to possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Although the district court found the truck was subject to forfeiture under Iowa Code &sect; 809A.13(7) (2003) because a substantial connection was proved between the truck and the criminal offense, the district court found forfeiture of the $ 30,000 truck would be &quot;grossly disproportional&quot; to the owner's criminal culpability and would therefore constitute an excessive fine in violation of his constitutional rights. The appellate court ruled that the owner satisfied his burden to demonstrate the &quot;punishment&quot; occasioned by the proposed forfeiture would bear a grossly disproportional relationship with the gravity of his offense and the extent of his culpability. The owner pled guilty to a class D felony, which carried a maximum fine of $ 7,500, and forfeiture of the $ 30,000 truck would result in an economic loss to the owner four times the maximum fine authorized by the Iowa Legislature.</SPAN></P>

He also argued that Iowa Code &sect; 321J.2 was void because it was vague and overbroad. The appellate court disagreed, finding that defendant told the arresting officer he had consumed five to six beers. Even at trial, he admitted to drinking 24 ounces of beer. Because the evidence showed defendant consumed alcohol, he could not use the prescribed medicine defense. Nor was it error to deny defendant to use the automatism defense as his behavior evidenced consciousness, he knew that mixing drugs with alcohol was not a good idea, and he was operating a motor vehicle. Thus, the trial court's finding of general intent was proper. Further, the OWI statute had already been found not to be vague, and protecting the public from drivers impaired by drugs and alcohol was rational basis for the statute.</SPAN></P>

He essentially claimed that ch. 229A was not narrowly tailored. He argued that the statute violated due process because it permitted commitment through showing that the offender was more likely than not to re-offend at some point within his lifetime. He argued that the likelihood of re-offense must be within a shorter time period, such as within the immediate future. The appellate court found his arguments unconvincing because the present tense language of ch. 229A required that a person be found to be both dangerous and to have a mental abnormality at the time of the proposed commitment and ch. 229A provided for a yearly review of the individual's condition. The present tense language and the annual review provision allowed ch. 229A to comport with due process. The appellate court concluded it was proper to review defendant's equal protection claim under a rational basis analysis, and it found nothing wrong with the jury instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of four counts of second-degree sexual abuse (one count for each victim), in the Iowa District Court for Polk County. Defendant appealed, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and the trial court's refusal to sever the charges. he also asserted that counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 702.17, 709.1, and 709.3 as unconstitutionally over-broad and vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record showed the victims made explicit allegations, describing defendant's acts of rubbing his penis against their buttocks. Defendant argued that such actions did not meet the statutory definition of a sex act. However, the statutory language of Iowa Code &sect; 709.1 was broad. Contact between an adult and child simply had to be sexual in nature to fall within the definition of sex act. Further, the statute did not restrict the use of artificial or substitute sexual organs (at issue in most of the case law), to the perpetrator. The statute used the less restrictive &quot;one person&quot; and &quot;another person&quot; language when defining sex acts. Thus, the evidence sufficed to support defendants convictions. Secondly, the district court did not err in not granting defendant's motion to sever since prejudice was less likely in a bench trial, and while the separate offenses occurred over a long period of time, they probably would have been admissible to show defendant's motive had there been severance. Finally, Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 702.17, 709.1, and 709.3 were not unconstitutionally over-broad and vague and counsel did not fail in an essential duty by not raising any challenges thereon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">We affirm the defendant's convictions. We conclude trial counsel was not ineffective in not challenging the constitutionality of the statutes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI). He appealed, asserting that the Iowa District Court for Clayton County erred in denying his motion to suppress because the district court incorrectly interpreted Iowa Code &sect; 321.354 (a prohibition as to stopping a vehicle on a highway), and in doing so, violated his constitutional right against unreasonable stops, searches and seizures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record showed that in the very late hours, an officer observed defendant stop his vehicle at a highway intersection even though defendant had no stop sign or signal to do so and there were no other vehicles approaching from any direction. Defendant then proceeded on at a high rate of speed. The officer then stopped defendant for &quot;stopping on the paved part of highway,&quot; in violation of Iowa Code &sect; 321.354. At that time the officer determined that defendant was intoxicated. The appellate court agreed with the district court that the Iowa Supreme Court had previously decided the prohibition found in &sect; 321.354 against stopping a vehicle on the traveled portion of the highway included momentary, as well as extended, stops. Thus, the officer had reasonable cause to believe defendant had committed a traffic offense and reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop of his vehicle. Accordingly, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1985, appellant, a former inmate, admitted committing lascivious acts with a child. In 1989, he was convicted of second degree sexual abuse. In 2002, he pled guilty to indecent contact with a child. In 2003, the State petitioned to have the inmate committed as a sexually violent predator pursuant to Iowa Code ch. 229A. A jury in the Iowa District Court for Appanoose County found he was a sexually violent predator. The former inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the former inmate argued that Iowa Code ch. 229A (2003) violated due process because it failed to contain a temporal limitation for calculating a predator's risk of re-offense. Second, he argued that the statute violated equal protection because it required a standard of proof for commitment different from the standard required to commit similarly situated individuals under Iowa Code ch. 229 (2003). However, the appellate court held that where, as in the former inmate's case, a recent overt act had been found, same was sufficient for a finding of dangerousness. A mental abnormality along with the recent overt act therefore made an individual a present and immediate threat to the community. Thus, as to the application of ch. 229, due process was satisfied because a person had to be found both dangerous and mentally ill at the time of commitment. Secondly, even before adjudication as sexually violent predators, individuals subject to commitment under ch. 229A were not similarly situated to individuals subject to commitment under Iowa Code ch. 229. Thus, it was proper to review the former inmate's equal protection claim under a rational basis analysis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the lower court's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, an applicant, applied for licensure with respondent, the Board of Psychology Examiners of the State of Iowa. The Board denied his application on grounds that he had not completed a one year residency at the educational institution which granted his doctoral degree as required by Iowa Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant first contended the Board erred in interpreting Iowa Admin. Code r. 645-240.3(2)(i) as requiring a continuous &quot;one year's residency&quot; because the Board was reading a requirement into the rule that did not appear on its face. He asserted the Board's interpretation of the rule was unreasonably restrictive as it effectively foreclosed licensure for all candidates who received degrees from non-traditional, non-American Psychological Association (APA) accredited institutions (as he did). However, an agency was entitled to substantial deference when interpreting its own regulations, and the appellate court did not find that the Board's interpretation of its own rule was irrational, illogical, or wholly unjustifiable. Further, the legislature had clearly vested the Board with the authority to adopt and enforce rules governing educational qualifications. The appellate court also rejected the Board's interpretation deprives him of equal protection under the law. There was no evidence the Board applied a different standard in evaluating his application than it had in evaluating the applications of other individuals who had received degrees from non-APA-accredited schools.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A child had previously been adjudicated a child in need of assistance (CINA). A subsequent juvenile court order confirmed one child's return to foster care and formally rescinded her trial placement with appellant mother. Pursuant to a petition filed by appellee State, the Iowa District Court for Benton County filed a ruling terminating the mother's parental rights pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 232.116(1)(f) (2005) to her child.

She argued that under the statutory language a child had not been removed for the requisite period not only if a trial period at home of 30 days or more had occurred within the last 12 consecutive months but also if a trial period at home of 30 days or more had occurred within the period of 12 of the last 18 months. Reading the claim as applying to the third element of current &sect; 232.116(1)(f), the language &quot;and any trial period at home has been less than 30 days&quot; applied to and qualified only the phrase within which it appeared following the word &quot;or.&quot; The appellate court agreed that applying the qualifying language &quot;and any trial period at home has been less than 30 days&quot; to the phrase &quot;for at least 12 of the last 18 months&quot; would effectively read that phrase out of the statute because by its terms that phrase allowed the State to pursue termination even when a child might have been in a parental home for up to 6 of the last 18 months.</SPAN></P>

The Council contended its decision to grant a certificate of need was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. The appellate court ruled that the district court's exercise of discretion to remand for further proceedings was reasonable, well-considered, and an attempt to allow the Council to fulfill the statutory requirements, Iowa Code &sect; 135.64. Although the district court determined it probably had sufficient grounds to reverse the grant of the certificate of need, it gave the Council the benefit of the doubt and sought to avoid a lengthy appeal process by choosing to remand to allow the Council to consider the evidence more adequately, to articulate the factual basis for its decision more clearly, and to modify its decision if warranted rather than simply reversing the Council's decision.</SPAN></P>

The court first noted that it considered the reasonableness of the stop based on an objective standard, which did not depend upon the actual motivation of the individual officer. Therefore, the court only looked to whether there was probable cause for the stop. The officer could properly stop defendant for violating &sect; 321.387. The court concluded that the officer had probable cause to stop defendant's vehicle. The court next found that defendant consented to a search of his pockets by voluntarily removing the items from his pockets. The court found that the officer's testimony on the issue of consent was more credible than that of defendant. Because the specific issue of whether the &quot;dugout&quot; found in defendant's pocket was not addressed by the district court, that issue was not preserved for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the district court abused its discretion in granting defendant's motion for new trial. The fact that defendant was subject to criminal sanctions because he incorrectly assessed the victim's mental capacity did not render the statute unconstitutional. The statute did not violate defendant's due process rights. The standard imposed by Iowa Code &sect; 709.4(4) was clear: to avoid the proscribed conduct, defendant should have refrained from performing a sex act with a person who was mentally incapacitated as that term was defined in Iowa Code &sect; 709.1A(1). If he did engage in such conduct, his lack of knowledge of the victim's mental incapacitation caused by his intoxication was no defense. The weight of the evidence supported a jury conclusion that defendant knew of the victim's mental incapacitation, as evidence indicated she was dragged into the hotel room and was unconscious throughout the entire incident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The established father was originally placed on the child's birth certificate. Later, the putative father claimed that he was the father of the child. The trial court took judicial notice of paternity tests and ruled in the putative father's favor. The court reversed. The one court order addressing the blood tests did not follow the terms of Iowa Code &sect; 600B.41(2) (2003). The test results were filed by a party, not by an appointed expert, thus not meeting the requirements for admission without further foundation pursuant to &sect; 600B.41(2). The putative father made no effort to establish a foundation for the tests. Therefore, the trial court erred in taking judicial notice of the tests. The putative father was entitled to petition the court to overcome the established father's paternity, but the court found this right waived. Despite having knowledge of the child's birth and the fact that he might have been the child's father, the putative father took no action to establish his parental rights for over five years. Thus, the established father's paternity should not have been disestablished, and under Iowa Code &sect; 600B.41A(6)(b), the court dismissed the action to overcome paternity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and dismissed the action to overcome paternity. The court preserved the paternity of the established father and established that the child remained his son and that he was to remain in the established father's primary physical care.</SPAN></P>

Later, when questioned by a judge about the service, defendant referred to the back of the subpoena. Defendant claimed that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to consult or communicate with him, master the record, and accurately cite to the record. Nevertheless, most of the facts and arguments had no impact upon defendant's convictions. Defendant also raised several arguments based on the Ex Post Facto Clause. However, the interpretations of &quot;under oath&quot; and &quot;falsifies&quot; as used by the district court, and stated by the supreme court, were not unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue. As to alleged error based on a jury instruction, the instruction properly limited the offense to the act of the signing the proof of service on the subpoena. Appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise these meritless claims.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to serve a 15-year indeterminate term of imprisonment under the first count and a two-year term of imprisonment under the second count, to run concurrently. He was also ordered to pay various fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers arrested defendant for public intoxication after he exhibited slurred speech, poor balance, watery/bloodshot eyes, and an odor consistent to that of alcohol emitting from his person. During the search incident to his arrest, the officers located a &quot;crack pipe&quot; in the roll of his stocking cap. Defendant subsequently pled guilty to possession of a controlled substance and public intoxication, third offense. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court failed to establish an adequate factual basis prior to accepting his guilty pleas. The court found that defendant's admissions to the trial court, along with the information contained in the officers' incident report, provided ample evidence for the trial court to be satisfied that the facts supported the crimes, not necessarily that defendant was guilty. Defendant's pleas were supported by a factual basis and defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise a meritless issue. The court further found that the plain meaning of &quot;intoxicated&quot; in Iowa Code &sect; 123.46 (2003) clearly applied to defendant's physical state. The public intoxication statute,&nbsp;&sect; 123.46, was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

It determined the statute was not void for vagueness or overbroad because defendant had not established a First Amendment right to tape record communications while she was absent. The court determined Iowa Code &sect; 727.8 (2003) was a general intent statute and equal protection was not violated because no fundamental right or suspect classification was involved, and the State had a rational basis for protecting its citizens from having their communications intercepted by unauthorized persons. The statute required either that the person recording obtain the authority or else be openly present. The statute merely prevented defendant from indiscriminate recording of conversations to which she was not a party. Defendant was not recording her conversations and interactions with coworkers. She failed to turn off the recorder when she left the office. The trial court was correct in not incorporating willfulness from Iowa Code ch. 808B, as it was not an element in Iowa Code &sect; 727.8.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Winnebago County, John S. Mackey, Judge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city gave plaintiff property owner notice to abate a nuisance. The property owner took no action, and the city abated the nuisance by removing certain materials.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court concluded that the city was performing a discretionary function under the applicable ordinances and was afforded discretionary function immunity under Iowa Code &sect; 670.4(3). The appellate court agreed with the district court, that the city satisfied both prongs of the analysis for such immunity required under the United State's Supreme Court decision in Berkovitz. Under the applicable ordinance, the challenged conduct did involve an element of judgment or discretion and the first part of the Berkovitz test was met. The second issue was whether the city could have considered legitimate policy-based factors in its decision to abate the particular nuisance. Legitimate policy-based considerations were those supported by social, political, or economic policies. The appellate court held the city legitimately could have considered such matters, and economic development policies, and how the continuing existence of a large, visible nuisance would have affected decisions of businesses and people to move to, remain in, or leave the city. Thus, the city's action was the performance of a discretionary function that was entitled to statutory immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner was the owner of three multiple unit residential rental properties located within the municipal limits of the city. Pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 364.17(3) (1999) and Fort Dodge, Iowa, Mun. Code, ch. 14.08, the sheriff served the landlord with notification of a housing inspection. The landlord subsequently amended his leases to provide that &quot;the landlord was not allowed to provide entry to third parties to the rental property for any reason without express permission of the tenant.&quot; The landlord also informed the tenants that they would bear the cost of any future inspections. The appellate court affirmed the injunction and held that it was a legitimate use of the city's police power to make sure that the landlord was providing dwellings that promoted the health and safety of tenants. The appellate court held that the inspection process was not so oppressive that it amounted to a taking. The appellate court also held that the clause that the landlord added to his leases went against public policy because it was calculated to obstruct inspections of the landlord's rental properties; thus, the clause could not be used to excuse his refusal to access or avoid the injunction.</SPAN></P>

Because Iowa Code &sect; 321J.2(3)(a)(1) provided that any margin of error in an Intoxilyzer test result should not be considered in considering a defendant's eligibility for a deferred judgment, any margin of error for a test result such as defendant's was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

The State asserted that the statements were not inconsistent, and, even assuming they were, the factfinder was alerted to any differences by trial counsel. Moreover, the inmate was not prejudiced. The inmate also argued that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to challenge Iowa's kidnapping statute as unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of his case. Nevertheless, counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise a meritless issue. The appellate court also found no merit in the contention that the trial court imposed punishment for an act that was not punishable when committed.

After describing defendant's act of masturbation and characterizing it as &quot;weird,&quot; the other complainant stated, &quot;I think he was trying to be funny.&quot; When asked about his reaction, the complainant stated that he did not think the masturbation was funny. A presumption of offensiveness would have excused the State from proving an element of its case, and that was impermissible. Neither complainant testified that they were offended by defendant's conduct. Therefore, the State failed in its burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

The officer gave one or two knee strike to the husband's upper buttocks in attempt to subdue the husband while the husband was being handcuffed. The couple was then taken to the casino's security room. After the trial court granted defendants' summary judgment motion, the couple filed a motion pursuant to Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.904(2). The appellate court held that the couple's appeal was not untimely, as the filing of the Rule 1.904(2) tolled the time for perfecting an appeal. The appellate court affirmed the grant of summary judgment. The couple's claims against the city for negligent or inadequate training and supervision were not supported by the record. The claim that the couple was unlawfully detained was rejected as the wife had refused to leave the casino. Also, the court found the officers were entitled to qualified immunity as the officer's actions were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Scott County, Bobbi M. Alpers, Judge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a divorce decree, the trial court had ordered that upon appellant husband's retirement from the Army he pay appellee wife 50 percent of the marital share of his &quot;disposable retired pay each month.&quot; Later, the Iowa District Court for Scott County denied his motion to modify the order to delete any award to the wife of any portion of the latter amount waived by him in order to receive veterans' disability benefits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the husband's motion, concluding that although the order required him to indemnify the wife if he were to receive disability pay, thus reducing her share of his disposable retired pay, the order did not require that he indemnify her with his disability pay. Under 10 U.S.C.S. 1408(a)(4)(B) of the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act, 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1408, and federal caselaw, a state court could not treat military retirement pay that was waived to receive veterans' disability benefits, as divisible property in a dissolution proceeding. Further, the Iowa Supreme Court had held that while veterans' disability benefits could be considered in the equitable granting of alimony or support, that type of payment could not be considered marital property. However, the trial court did not err in determining that the military pension division order did not require the husband to indemnify the wife with his veterans' disability benefits. It required him to pay any &quot;make-up&quot; amount only if, and to the extent he was able to do so, with a source of funds other than his veterans' disability benefits. Accordingly, the order did not violate the USFSPA.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that Iowa Code &sect; 356.7 (2003) was not an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to the county sheriff contrary to Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 1. The court further found no merit to the inmates' claim that they were treated differently from other prisoners incarcerated in other counties who were subject to lower per diem room and board claims. As there were no guidelines or per diem rates set forth under &sect; 356.7, the charges could vary from county to county. The court found no equal protection violation under &sect; 356.7 as applied to the inmates. Finally, the court found that the sheriff, in setting and requesting reimbursement for room and board, did not deprive the inmates of due process as he provided both notice to the inmates and was equipped with an adequate standard by which to implement &sect; 356.7.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's vehicle was stopped after a trooper observed it weaving. Narcotics agents called a canine unit to the scene, and, after the dog alerted, defendant was searched and a small amount of methamphetamine was found on him. A search was conducted on his vehicle and he was subsequently convicted of possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver, conspiracy to deliver methamphetamine, and failure to possess a tax stamp. On appeal, the court affirmed, stating that his speedy trial rights were not violated because there was good cause for the trial court to set the trial outside the speedy trial deadline. Also, the delay was attributable to defendant, because it was not possible for him to take depositions of the State's witnesses and have a hearing on all of the motions filed prior to December 9. Further, an agent's testimony was not hearsay pursuant to Iowa R. Evid. 5.801(c); he was simply testifying concerning the reason that he found it necessary to take an initial and responsive action. The warrantless search was justified under Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 8 by the existence of probable cause coupled with the exigent circumstances of the car being mobile.</SPAN></P>

Mun. Fire &amp; Police Ret. Sys. of Iowa, 690 N.W.2d 463, 2004 Iowa App. LEXIS 1414 (Iowa Ct. App., 2004)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A medical board determined plaintiff police officer was incapacitated as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder. The police officer applied for accidental disability pension benefits. Defendant, the Municipal Fire and Police Retirement System of Iowa (MFPRS) awarded the police officer only ordinary disability benefits. Its appeals board affirmed the decision as did the Iowa District Court for Polk County. The police officer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record established the police officer was exposed to several incidents of violent death. In order to receive accidental disability benefits for a mental injury, an officer had to show that his mental injury was caused or aggravated at some definite time and place, and that his mental injury was caused by something more than the day-to-day emotional stress. The appellate court rejected the police officer's claims that the relevant statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 411.6(5)(c), denied him equal protection of the law because it created an exception for the &quot;at some definite time and place&quot; requirement for diseases of the heart, lung, or respiratory tract, but not for mental diseases. There was a rational basis to distinguish between the former diseases, which could be difficult or impossible to link to a definite time and place, and post-traumatic stress syndrome, which could possibly be linked to a specific employment incident. Further, the police offer failed to show he had been subjected to more than usual stress for a police officer. Thus, there was substantial evidence to support the board's decision that the officer was entitled to only ordinary disability benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, mother, appealed the Iowa District Court for Sioux County decision finding her to be in contempt of court due to visitation violations. The district court concluded the grandparent visitation order in the case was not unconstitutional because it was combined with the visitation ordered for the father. The mother petitioned for writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued the grandparent visitation order, based on Iowa Code &sect; 598.35(6), was unconstitutional; thus, she was not in contempt. The instant court agreed. Section 598.35(6) was unconstitutional, as it failed to comport with the Due Process Clause on its face. As &sect; 598.35(6) was unconstitutional, the mother was not found in contempt for failing to provide grandparent visitation. Also, the grandparent visitation order was vague, as it was not clear whether the grandparents were entitled to unlimited visitation as long as the father did not object, or whether they were limited to 25 percent of the father's visitation and only during times when he was unavailable. The father failed to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the mother willfully violated a court order. The grandmother made almost all of the arrangements for visitation, and the grandparents picked up the child for visitation. It was unclear whether the grandparents were acting on their own behalf or whether they were acting for the father. There was no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the mother was intentionally denying visitation to the father, as he almost never sought visitation on his own behalf.</SPAN></P>

The trial court continued the child in foster care after it determined that the father needed more parental training and a better living arrangement before he was able to care for the child. After a clinical social worker found that the child was likely to be neglected and/or abused if placed with the father, the State sought to terminate the father's parental rights. The trial court did so and ruled that the father was not denied due process. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court refused to reconsider whether the child should have been adjudicated a child in need of assistance because the parties stipulated to this finding and the father did not appeal from this final order. The court further found that the father's rights were properly terminated based on his own acts and omissions. The court found no violation of the father's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist filed this action after being involved in an automobile accident with the driver. The driver and owner filed an offer to confess judgment, which the motorist rejected. At trial, the motorist was awarded damages, but in an amount less than that offered. The trial court entered the judgment and ordered the motorist to pay costs under Iowa Code &sect; 677.10 (2001). The court affirmed. The trial court did not err in denying the motorist's motion for a new trial based on verdict inconsistency. Although the motorist claimed that the verdict was inconsistent because the jury awarded her damages for past medical expenses, but not for past loss of full use of body, case law did not support that this created an inconsistency. Furthermore, the motorist did not present evidence of a functional impairment due to her injury and the verdict was clear that the jury made certain credibility determinations. The court held that Iowa Code ch. 677 did not discriminate between different types of plaintiffs or defendants and it did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 6. Thus, the ruling taxing costs against the motorist was proper.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed some of the conduct forming the basis of the charge occurred before the effective date of &sect; 902.12. He asserted counsel was ineffective in failing to ascertain whether the acts occurred before the effective date of &sect; 902.12 and failing to argue that application of the statute to him violated the ex post facto clause. He argued that counsel should have asked the court to specify the dates on which the sex acts took place. However, he had not shown that this omission worked to his disadvantage. Had counsel done what defendant said should have been done, a record would have been created for application of &sect; 902.12. As he suffered no prejudice, counsel was not ineffective. The jury verdict did not specify whether pre or post-1996 acts were relied on in finding guilt. Under these circumstances, the appellate court presumed that the jury may have based its verdict on pre-1996 acts. As &sect; 902.12 did not take effect until 1996, application of the statute to defendant was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was committed to the custody of the Iowa Department of Human Services pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 229A.7(3) (Supp. 2002). On appeal, he argued the jury instructions did not adequately define mental abnormality as requiring the State to show he had serious difficulty in controlling his behavior. Under controlling case law, the appellate court believed the jury instruction given was inadequate because it did not allow for a clear determination by the jury that respondent had serious difficulty in controlling his behavior. Accordingly, his commitment had to be reversed. His lascivious acts conviction was itself the qualifying overt act. Respondent's confinement for a sexually violent offense at the time the petition was filed relieved the State from establishing a recent overt act separate and distinct from the lascivious acts conviction. Because the jury instruction defining mental abnormality did not adequately instruct the jury that it had to find respondent had serious difficulty in controlling his behavior, the appellate court reversed respondent's commitment; if he was retried before release from confinement, the State did not need to plead or prove a recent overt act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A food company salesman came to the consumer's house to give a sales presentation for food company's line of frozen foods. The consumer agreed to purchase six months' worth of frozen food for a monthly fee. The food company salesman then offered her a gas grill at no additional cost. The consumer was led to believe that the grill would be free with her food purchase. The grill, however, was not free. When the consumer tried to cancel her contract the food company disallowed it, and when she stopped payments on the grill, she was sued. The jury returned verdicts in favor of the consumer. On appeal, the food company contended the punitive damage award should not be allowed because the jury did not award actual damages. Actual damages were shown. The food company asserted the punitive damages award was so excessive it should be reduced. Because the appellate court could not reconcile the punitive damage judgment with the due process requirements pronounced by case law, it was reversed and remanded. The penalty on the finance charge on the grill was statutorily limited to $ 1,000, so it was remanded to impose a penalty which did not exceed the statutory limit of $ 1,000.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for a new trial on the punitive damage issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Polk County, Robert A. Hutchison (motion to dismiss) and Paul R. Huscher (trial), Judges. A biological father appeals the juvenile court's refusal to vacate an order terminating his parental rights. Judge Hutchison affirmed; Judge Huscher affirmed in part and reversed in part.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa District Court for Polk County refused to vacate an order terminating appellant biological father's parental rights because the trial court determined that the father was not a necessary party and had no standing to challenge the termination order. The father appealed. Intervenor adoptive parents cross-appealed, contending that their motion to intervene in the proceedings should be granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A notice directed to the father informing him that a petition to terminate had been filed was published on two occasions in a weekly newspaper. The notice stated that there would be a hearing before the trial court. The trial court entered an order terminating the father's parental rights. The trial court found that the presence of the biological mother, the biological father, and the minor child was waived. The father filed a petition to vacate the judgment. The trial court determined that the father had no standing to challenge the termination order because he was not a necessary party, in that he was neither required to be included on the petition under Iowa Code &sect; 600A.5(3)(a), nor was he a putative father who filed a declaration of paternity in accordance with Iowa Code &sect; 144.12A or an unknown putative father. On appeal, the court reversed, stating that the affidavit that the notice was published twice, standing alone, did not confer personal jurisdiction of the trial court over the father. The court also found that the father was a necessary party to the termination, because he was, at the time the petition was filed, a known, living parent of the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's determination and remanded for further proceedings, including a resumption of the termination hearing that was terminated on the trial court's own motion. The court held that the adoptive parents should be allowed to intervene in the termination action. The court affirmed the ruling that the adoptive parents be allowed to intervene in the trial on the petition to vacate if a hearing on that issue was held.</SPAN></P>

Wanting to extract raw materials, it applied for a special exception use permit. The board denied the permit. The corporation appealed to the county Board of Supervisors. They denied the application. The corporation then filed a petition for writ of certiorari, declaratory judgment, and money damages. The district court denied the corporation's motion to compel discovery. In addressing the corporation's claim for damages based upon statutory and constitutional violations, it concluded the corporation had not adequately exhausted its remedies and was not entitled to relief. The corporation appealed the district court's rulings. The appellate court determined the district court abused its discretion by ruling that further discovery was not necessary and concluded the case should be reversed and remanded to the district court to allow the corporation the opportunity to gather evidence to support its claim of ex parte communications to the board. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that that the corporation's takings' claim was not ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction because &sect; 321J.2 was not a properly enacted statute. The court affirmed the district court's decision, stating that &sect; 321J.2 derived from several acts of the Iowa General Assembly, each of which contained the enacting clause prescribed by the Iowa Constitution. The general assembly properly authorized the compilation of these acts into the Iowa Code, and each statute in the Iowa Code provided the acts from which that section was derived so as to allow the public to readily verify that the statutes were proper expressions of the authority of the general assembly, duly enacted by that body. Defendant also challenged the legislature's authority to administer and enforce its traffic regulatory power through the Departments of Transportation and Public Safety. The court held that defendant had not met her burden to overcome the presumption that the legislature's delegations of authority to these agencies were accompanied by adequate standards or guidelines that allowed the agencies to accomplish a general purpose and public policy of the legislature without abdicating to them the right to legislate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sexually abusing his stepsister and was subsequently convicted of sexual abuse in the second degree, Iowa Code &sect; 709.3(2) (2001). He objected to the application of a minimum sentence under Iowa Code &sect; 902.12(3) as a violation of his protection against ex post facto laws. The court held that it was inappropriate to impose &sect; 902.12's minimum sentence provisions, thereby enhancing the severity of defendant's punishment, when the conviction was the result of a general verdict that could have been based on acts occurring prior to the effective date of the statute. With regard to defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the court stated that there was not enough information in the record for it to make a determination as to whether defendant's confession, under the totality of the circumstances, was indeed involuntary and whether his counsel was ineffective for failing to seek its suppression. That issue was preserved for postconviction proceedings. The court concluded that there was substantial evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a sex act did occur.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged the sexually-violent predator, a convicted sex offender, was a sexually violent predator and should be committed.

The trial court instructed the jury, over his objection, that it could find he was a sexually-violent predator, if the State proved certain elements beyond a reasonable doubt. However, nowhere in the instruction did it say the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had a serious difficulty controlling his behavior. The jury returned a verdict finding he was a sexually-violent predator. The trial court entered an order committing him. After he appealed, the appellate court found that he did not preserve for review his argument that the sexually-violent predator statute violated his rights under the United States Constitution. However, it also found that the trial court erred, as it should have instructed the jury that it had to find that the State proved he had serious difficulty controlling his behavior and that the error was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by the Iowa District Court for Scott County of possession of crack cocaine with intent to deliver (Count I), in violation of Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 124.401(1)(c)(3), 124.206(2)(d), and 703.1 (2001), and failure to affix a drug tax stamp (Count II), in violation of Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 453B.1(3)(d), 453B.12, and 703.1.

A total of 7 rocks of crack were found. The term &quot;dosage unit&quot; was not defined as .1 grams in ch. 453B or in the rules adopted by the director of revenue under Iowa Code &sect; 453B.2. In fact, ch. 453B specifically defined &quot;dosage unit&quot; as the unit of measure in which a substance was dispensed to the ultimate user. The Court of Appeals of Iowa held that a &quot;dosage unit&quot; had to be defined as the unit of measurement in which the substance was dispensed to the ultimate user, in the case at bar, either $ 20 or $ 50 individual rocks of crack cocaine. Because defendant possessed only 7 individual rocks of crack cocaine, he possessed only 7 &quot;dosage units&quot; of the taxable substance. Thus, he did not fit under the definition of a &quot;dealer&quot; found in &sect; 453B.1(3)(d). Therefore, there was insufficient evidence to have found him in violation of the drug tax stamp statute (Count II). The evidence was sufficient to have found him guilty of possession of crack cocaine with intent to deliver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and the case was remanded for entry of judgment of acquittal on Count II for lack of sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that this was racial discrimination because more African-American people used crack cocaine. Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed, as: (1) he waived his right to contend that Iowa sentencing law was unconstitutional, in that he failed to raise the issue in the trial court; (2) defendant failed to show that his defense counsel was ineffective for failure to assert the claim that the sentencing disparity discriminated against defendant on the basis of race, in that such a claim would have been rejected by the district court; and (3) defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by his counsel's failure to present the disparity claim, in that Iowa Code &sect; 124.401 was constitutional under a rational basis standard of review, because the increased penalty the legislature imposed for possession of crack cocaine was rationally related to the State's interest in curbing the increasing and widespread use of crack cocaine.</SPAN></P>

Section 702.18(1)(c) adequately defined the terms &quot;surgical repair&quot; and &quot;necessitates the administration of general anesthesia.&quot; The court noted that defendant only had standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 702.18(1)(c) as it applied to the facts of his particular case. A doctor testified that the only way to perform the necessary procedure was to use general anesthesia. Because &sect; 702.18(1)(c) was constitutional, counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the issue before the trial court. The court did not address defendant's arguments concerning counsel's effectiveness regarding an alleged failure to investigate and present certain witnesses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CONVICTIONS AFFIRMED; SENTENCE ON COUNT I VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of sexual abuse in the second degree and two counts of sexual abuse in the third degree, in the Iowa District Court for Polk County. Defendant appealed, asserting the court trial erred in applying Iowa Code &sect; 902.12(3) (2001) to his sentence for sexual abuse in the second degree, in overruling his objection to improper cross-examination, and that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to hearsay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Jury Instruction No. 15 instructed that the jury could find defendant guilty of sexual abuse in the second degree, Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 709.1 and 709.3 (2001), if the State proved he performed a sex act with the child between November 5,1995, and November 4, 1999, and that the child was under 12. The appellate court concluded the trial court erred in applying the 85 percent rule, pursuant to Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 902.12 and 903A.2, to defendant's sentence. The jury could have found defendant guilty based on an act or acts that occurred prior to July 1, 1996, the effective date of Iowa Code &sect; 902.12, which imposed a mandatory minimum sentence for sexual abuse in the second degree. The application of &sect; 902.12 to defendant violated the Ex Post Facto Clauses of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 21. However, defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court overruling defendant's objection that his cross-examination exceeded the scope of direct examination, as substantially the same evidence was in the record from the testimony of two other witnesses without objection. The record was insufficient to address defendant's claim of ineffective assistance on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed. However, defendant's sentence for sexual abuse in the second degree was vacated, and the matter was remanded for resentencing. Defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were preserved for postconviction proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, alleged civilly committed predator (predator), sought review of the decision of the Iowa District Court for Black Hawk County, which found in favor of appellee State, found the predator to be a sexually violent predator pursuant to Iowa Code ch. 229A (1999), and civilly committed him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The predator pled guilty to sexual offenses in 1985 and 1991. He discharged his sentences for both offenses. In 1996, he was convicted of theft. Because he discharged his sentence, the State petitioned to have him found a sexually violent predator, pursuant to Iowa Code ch. 229A (1999). A jury found him to be one, and he was civilly committed. On appeal, the predator contended that the application of the sexually violent predator statute to him was unconstitutional, as his most recent confinement was for a non-sexual offense, and he did not commit a recent overt act as defined in ch. 229A. The court stated that, because the predator was not confined for a sexually violent offense when the State served him with the ch. 229A petition, he was entitled to dismissal of the commitment order on that ground. Further, the predator's incidents of exposing himself while in prison for the theft conviction did not amount to recent overt acts, as the language of Iowa Code &sect; 229A.4(1), (2) (1999) applied to individuals not presently confined in prison. Further, there was not substantial evidence to support the predator's commission of such an act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a jury's finding that he was a sexually violent predator under Iowa Code ch. 229A (1999). He claimed, inter alia: (1) chapter 229A violated substantive due process; (2) the refusal by the Iowa District Court for Henry County of a proposed jury instruction violated due process; (3) the evidence was insufficient to support his commitment; and (4) the court did not have jurisdiction over him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had not stated how his claim of unconstitutionality was preserved for review. Therefore, the appellate court did not consider his claims concerning the constitutionality of Iowa Code ch. 229A. Defendant next asserted that the district court erred in not including in its instructions the requirement of a finding he had &quot;serious difficulty in controlling behavior.&quot; The Iowa Supreme Court interpreted Iowa Code &sect; 229A.2(4) as requiring a showing of a serious difficulty in controlling behavior. The appellate court concluded Barnes controlled its resolution of that issue and required reversal. Defendant also contended that the State did not have jurisdiction over him for the purposes of filing the petition to commit him. He argued that holding the probable cause hearing after his release violated the procedures set forth in Iowa Code ch. 229A. The appellate court concluded defendant's argument misread ch. 229A and was without merit. The probable cause hearing was held the same day defendant was taken into custody. As defendant was not out of custody when the petition was filed, there was no requirement of a recent overt act to trigger the filing of a petition to commit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa District Court for Linn County found that the child in interest had suffered neglect, and an instance of sexual abuse while in the care of appellee mother, and granted guardianship rights to appellants, the child's grandparents. The child was also placed in the grandparent's physical care. In the instant appeal, the grandparents appealed the trial court's parental visitation provisions of a guardianship order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother renewed her constitutional challenges to Iowa Code &sect; 633.552 (2001). The appellate court adopted the trial court's findings, that the mother did indeed neglect her child. For example, there was evidence the child suffered sexual contact by his cousin, and continued to suffer urinary difficulties from stress. Other evidence included the mother's pattern of missing the child's medical appointments, and exposing the child to her husband's intoxicated behavior. Meanwhile, the child had flourished under the care of the grandparents. The appellate court held the mother's constitutional challenge to &sect; 633.552 was fatally flawed, because it failed to consider &sect; 633.552 in pari materia with other relevant guardianship provisions which cured the infirmities dictating the outcomes in the United States Supreme Court decisions in Troxel and Santi. A nonparent did bear the burden of persuasion throughout guardianship proceedings. The grandparents met that burden. Further, the appellate court held the trial court's granting the mother the right to visit her child every weekend, and six weeks during the summer should have been more restrictive, and excluded overnight visits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed, but the visitation issue was remanded to the trial court with instructions to grant the mother more limited, and supervised visitation, excluding overnight visits with the child.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The evidence showed that the mother's husband had a chronic, severe, ongoing drug abuse problem. He was unsuccessfully discharged from substance abuse treatment programs. He refused to provide a drug test in July 2001, again in August, and again in September. It appeared to service providers that the husband was &quot;high&quot; when he appeared late for a supervised visit in August. The apparent purpose and intent of the trial court's orders was to encourage and work toward family reunification, but to do so while protecting the children from the danger presented by the husband's ongoing and unresolved substance abuse. It was the mother's insistence on exposing the children to the husband despite his unresolved drug abuse, not her desire and intent to maintain her marital relationship with him, that led the trial court to correctly conclude that the children could not be returned to her, despite almost two years of trial court involvement and the provision of services.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, sanitation companies, brought an action challenging the zoning decision of defendant city. The Iowa District Court for Johnson County ruled that their business activity of transferring garbage did not fall within the light industrial zone. The sanitation companies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to the cheaper Illinois fees for waste-dumping in landfills, the owners of the sanitation company concluded it would be more economical to dump waste in Illinois. To accomplish this, they formed a second business. Garbage at this facility was transferred to semi-trucks, spilling on to the loading docks during the transfer. City officials received complaints about odors at the site. The sanitation company's first argument was that the city's interpretation of its zoning code expanded the restrictive scope of the ordinance beyond its plain meaning. The appellate court disagreed. As garbage, in being garbage, did not conclusively have merely a negligible environmental impact, the appellate court concluded the question of whether a truck terminal for garbage transfer fell under the zoning definition was subject to interpretation. Substantial evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that the ordinance did not include truck terminals where garbage was transferred. The ordinance also did not violate the Commerce Clause by imposing an undue burden on interstate commerce. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the sanitation companies were not denied procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to properly object to the admission of certain exhibits and in failing to raise an equal protection challenge to Iowa Code &sect; 124.401(1)(b) (1999). The appellate court found that the trial court would not have abused its discretion in ruling the exhibits were admissible if counsel had made a timely objection. The exhibits were part of the circumstances of the crime, which was admissible in order to show the complete story. The State presented evidence that defendant conspired with the others to manufacture methamphetamine. The items found in a car were directly connected to the manufacturing process and were relevant to the conspiracy charge. Defendant's argument that counsel was ineffective in failing to raise an equal protection challenge to Iowa Code &sect; 124.401 was preserved for postconviction relief proceedings.  Iowa Code &sect; 901.10(2) was rationally related to the government's interest to curbing the use of methamphetamine. The legislature had to determine the most appropriate method of punishing criminal activity. The statute did not violate defendant's right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa District Court for Floyd County terminated the parental rights of appellant mother to her two minor children. The mother appealed, contending the trial court erred by: (1) judicially noticing evidence from prior proceedings; (2) determining there was clear and convincing evidence to terminate her parental rights; (3) not applying the exception to termination found in Iowa Code &sect; 232.116(3) (2001)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother had a history of purposefully injuring herself, and was diagnosed with an attachment disorder. One child developed a severe rash that would clear up when the child was hospitalized, but reappear when the child returned home. On appeal, the mother objected to the admission of testimony from prior proceedings. However, Iowa Code &sect; 232.96(6) allowed the use of hearsay evidence in juvenile proceedings, and the juvenile court could judicially notice exhibits that were part of the prior child in need of assistance proceedings (CINA) regarding the same children. The mother had not addressed her mental health problems, and her parenting skills did not improve because she was resistant to services. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to warrant termination of her rights under Iowa Code &sect; x 232.116(1)(d), (f), and (i). The appellate court rejected the mother's argument that she was denied her right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses with regard to the evidence from prior CINA proceedings, again, because the trial court could judicially notice the prior proceedings. Finally, Iowa Code &sect; 232.116 was not unconstitutionally vague and did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court, terminating the mother's parental rights, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court rejected defendant's arguments. The court found that, together with the lateness of the hour, the animated nature of the vehicle occupants' initial conversation, and the hurried way in which they left the scene on seeing the police, a reasonable officer would have reasonably believed a crime was being committed. The court also held that the search did not exceed the scope of a legitimate pat-down search, because the officer conducted the pat down search to secure his safety and the safety of others. After finding a postal scale on defendant, the officer made an expanded search based on the newly added suspicion of drug possession. The court also found, under Iowa Code &sect; 124.501(5), the district court correctly sentenced defendant as a third time offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment and sentence entered following his guilty pleas to willful injury and robbery in the second degree. He claimed on appeal his counsel was ineffective for failing to raise constitutional challenges to the imposition by the Iowa District Court for Polk County of victim restitution pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 910.3B(1) (1999) because the statute was violative of due process of law both facially and as applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended &sect; 910.3B(1) violated procedural due process because it deprived the sentencing court of discretion concerning the amount of the award and thus judicial review of the reward was effectively nullified. The appellate court disagreed. The legislature was free to recognize the seriousness of certain crimes and impose greater punishment, or as under that statute, supplement criminal punishment for serious crimes by imposing mandatory restitution. The appellate court found no merit to defendant's claim that &sect; 910.3B(1) was facially violative of his rights to procedural due process of law. Defendant did not suggest how his &quot;as applied&quot; challenge differed from his &quot;facial&quot; challenge to the statute. The appellate court was unable to discern any meaningful distinction between the two in the case at bar and therefore rejected his &quot;as applied&quot; procedural due process challenge for the same reasons. Neither did &sect; 910.3B appear to be in meaningful conflict with federal bankruptcy law. Accordingly, defendant's counsel had no duty to challenge &sect; 910.3B(1) on Supremacy Clause grounds, as such a claim appeared meritless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from her conviction, following a trial by the Iowa District Court for Marion County for tampering with a juror in violation of Iowa Code &sect; 720.4 (1999). She contended: (1) the statute required the State to prove the victim was a juror at the time of the incident; (2) the record contained insufficient evidence to convict her under &sect; 720.4; and (3) the statute was unconstitutional as applied to her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued &sect; 720.4 required the juror still be serving at the time of the retaliation. The trial court held the plain reading of &sect; 720.4 indicated that a juror did not need be still serving on a case, since the section mentioned &quot;retaliation for anything lawfully done.&quot; The appellate court agreed with the trial court's reading of the statute. Defendant's argument was at odds with the plain language of that portion of the statute. Defendant alleged there was insufficient evidence to prove: (1) she had a specific intent to intimidate, annoy, or alarm the juror; and (2) her call was without legitimate purpose. She asserted the legitimate purpose for the phone call was to gather information to help her friend with his appeal. Based on the facts and circumstances surrounding the phone call the trial court found that defendant made the phone call with the specific purpose to annoy or alarm the juror and it was done in a manner likely to cause her annoyance. The appellate court concluded there was substantial evidence in the record from which the trial court could have inferred defendant had the specific intent to intimidate the juror in retaliation for the guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. There was evidence which was persuasive beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had sufficient dominion and control over the premises to establish constructive possession of the crack cocaine with intent to deliver. Defendant was on the porch when the officers arrived. The baggie of crack cocaine was on the porch and visible. The baggie contained a large amount of crack cocaine. There was evidence defendant was aware of the bag of cocaine and had touched it, as he indicated after his arrest that it might have his fingerprints on it. Defendant was in the company of a friend, who was found to have a large sum of money on his person. Defendant and the friend were the only people at the house when the police arrived. The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the cocaine on the porch was in defendant's constructive possession, and that he had sufficient dominion and control over the area where the cocaine was found to establish that he possessed the crack cocaine with the intent to deliver.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held: (1) the acquittal on the murder charge rendered any challenge as to the consistency of the two murder charges moot, and the prosecutor's comment regarding sexual abuse in his closing argument in defendant's trial was not sufficient to raise a theory of inconsistency, as defendant was not charged with or found guilty of sexual abuse; (2) the denial by the trial court of defendant's motion for a bill of particulars did not violate her due process rights because the charges and the minutes of testimony were adequate to sufficiently apprise defendant of the charges against her; (3) medical evidence pinpointed the injuries as having occurred during the time frame found by the district court, and therefore, there was sufficient evidence to find multiple acts of child endangerment; (4) the diminished capacity defense was unavailable; and (5) Iowa Code &sect; 726.6(1)(a), 726.6(1)(e) (1999), were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Defendant used a club to administer blows to the victim's back and face, and then kicked the victim in the ribs after he had fallen to his knees. Furthermore, defendant testified he intended to hurt the victim with each blow. Therefore, reasonable inferences from that evidence were sufficient to support the jury's finding of malice aforethought. In addition, defendant's counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the trial court's imposition of restitution under Iowa Code &sect; 910.3B because it did not violate the defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The Story County District Court (Iowa) granted the child support extension, but denied the postsecondary educational subsidy. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the request for post-secondary education subsidies for the mother's son, as there was no provision for such an educational subsidy under Iowa Code &sect; 600B.25(1) similar to that for children of divorced parents under Iowa Code &sect; 598.21(5A) (2000). On appeal, the mother alleged that the trial court erred in denying her request for a postsecondary educational subsidy. The appellate court agreed with the mother's contention. The district court was correct in its conclusion that &sect; 600B.25(1) did not specifically provide for postsecondary educational subsidies, however, the court found that such a restriction, on the basis of illegitimacy, violated equal protection. The court held that the son born out of wedlock was entitled to the benefits provided by the current statute regarding postsecondary educational subsidies for divorced children, &sect; 598.21(5A).

The court of appeals disagreed.  Iowa Code &sect; 321.213 carved out a specific exception to the general rule set forth in Iowa Code &sect; 232.55 prohibiting a juvenile adjudication from being later used in an adult criminal proceeding.  Iowa Code &sect; 321.213, in part, specifically provided that, notwithstanding Iowa Code &sect; 232.55, a final adjudication in a juvenile court that a child violated the provisions of Iowa Code ch. 321J constituted a final conviction for the purposes of Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 321J.2, 321J.4. Thus, by its own clear wording, juvenile OWI adjudications were considered final convictions for purposes of criminal charges under Iowa Code &sect; 321J.2 and license revocation under Iowa Code &sect; 321J.4. Therefore, the trial court did not err in considering defendant's prior juvenile OWI adjudication.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated by Iowa Code &sect; 691.2, which allowed the introduction of the lab reports absent any in-court attestation from the preparers as to the reports' reliability. The appellate court agreed with defendant that laboratory reports were inadmissible as an exception to hearsay, if they were introduced without accompanying testimony by their preparer. The documents could otherwise be admitted however, if they possessed particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. The court found that, based on the inherent reliability of the reports, along with the presumption that a regularly enacted statute was constitutional, &sect; 691.2 did not violate the Confrontation Clause.

The owner contended that the order requiring the removal of the billboard violated its constitutional right to free speech. The appellate court found that: (1) the clear language of Iowa Admin. Code r. 761-117.6(5) did not require that the current permit holder be the entity responsible for the modification in order for the DOT to revoke the permit; (2) once a billboard was modified without prior approval the DOT was required to revoke the permit and require the removal of the billboard; and (3) there was no violation of the owner's right of free speech, as the state met its burden to show that traffic safety and aesthetics were substantial governmental interests, the statute and regulation directly advanced those interests, and the state went no further than necessary to serve these interests.</SPAN></P>

Defendant cashed two of the victim's checks, and confessed to taking her purse. Defendant testified he confessed to the crime because he was afraid of the police, and that on the date of the crime he was home all day. There was evidence defendant's actions placed the victim in fear of immediate serious injury by driving so close to her. The appellate court found that: (1) there was a rational difference between second degree robbery and extortion in that extortion did not require an immediate threat of physical harm; (2) the application of Iowa Code 902.12 to second degree robbery and failure to apply it to extortion did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; (3) defendant's confession was sufficiently corroborated by other evidence; (4) the robbery conviction was supported by sufficient evidence; and (5) defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the defendant claimed that the district court erred in admitting the laboratory report into evidence. The defendant argued that the admission of the laboratory report without accompanying testimony violated his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to confront witnesses. The appellate court rejected the defendant's contention and affirmed.  Iowa Code &sect; 691.2 provided for introduction of the report into evidence. The statute further provided that upon the request of a party or party's attorney, an employee or technician could be called to testify in person. The defendant made no such request. The defendant argued that the court should reexamine the rule in light of a recent Illinois Supreme Court decision, but the court declined. Based on judicial precedent in Iowa, the court concluded that the introduction of laboratory results without accompanying testimony did not violate the defendant's right to confront witnesses.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found: (1) the board was not required to determine whether the racetrack was a nuisance, but merely consider the concerns of economic development and health, safety, and welfare of the residents; (2) all the board had to do in response to noise objections in applying the general health, safety, welfare standard was impose restrictions on the dates and times of races, order the construction of a sound barrier, and mandate that race cars have mufflers; (3) the city council was not required to review the special permit rather than the board; and (4) the city zoning ordinance was not unconstitutional because of the powers it granted the board.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Wapello County, E. Richard Meadows, Jr., Judge. On appeal from a jury's finding that he is a sexually violent predator, the respondent argues chapter 229A is a punitive statute, violates the federal and state constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws, violates the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the state and federal constitutions, violates his right to substantive due process, and violates the Equal Protection Clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The respondent argues he was denied due process when the district court refused to give his requested instruction regarding the meaning of the term &quot;likely to engage in predatory acts of a sexual nature.&quot; He also claims he was denied due process when the court refused to give an instruction allowing the jury to consider less restrictive alternatives. The respondent contends&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the court incorrectly ruled the proper jury size under chapter 229A is eight people, and he claims the court erred in admitting evidence of his prior bad acts when he was willing to stipulate to his prior convictions.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Iowa District Court for Wapello County found that respondent was a sexually violent predator. Respondent argued that Iowa Code ch. 229A violated the prohibitions against ex post facto laws. He challenged the denial of a requested instruction, and raised numerous other claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a petition alleging respondent to be a sexually violent predator under Chapter 229A. Prohibitions against ex post facto laws applied only to penal or criminal actions, as did double jeopardy guarantees. This was a civil proceeding; thus those protections did not apply. There was no substantive due process violation. The legislative scheme of Chapter 229A was rationally related to the State's interest in protecting the public. The State did not have a burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that no less-restrictive alternative treatment facilities were available. District court did not err in deciding an eight-person jury was sufficient. Proof of the prior qualifying convictions was essential and therefore relevant to the State's case, and respondent's willingness to stipulate to the convictions did not prevent the State from tendering evidence on the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Prior opinions addressed and rejected all of the arguments advanced by respondent.

Appellant contended in part that the drug laws violated equal protection guarantees by treating addicts as harshly as drug dealers, and by punishing repeated possession of marijuana differently than possession of all other types of drugs. The court of appeals affirmed, because the state had a rational basis for treating marijuana possession differently, and the statute provided penalties for the possession of methamphetamine, not its use. Further, it was not clear that appellant was not also manufacturing methamphetamine. Second, a preponderance of the evidence supported the search incident to arrest exception, as there was no credible evidence that the store's loss prevention employees detained appellant at the request of, or to assist law enforcement officers. Third, regarding sentencing, the possibility that appellant could have benefitted from treatment was outweighed by his failure to benefit from past probations and his continued pattern of criminal behavior.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Johnson County District Court (Iowa), which convicted him for interference with official acts. Defendant's convictions arose out of two separate incidents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in: (1) failing to grant his motion to dismiss based on the unconstitutional vagueness of Iowa Code &sect; 719.1 (1999) as applied to the facts surrounding the interference with official acts charge; and (2) failing to instruct the jury on the theory of self-defense in the case involving the charge of interference with official acts causing injury. The instant court determined that defendant failed to preserve error on his vagueness challenge by filing his motion to dismiss in a timely manner. Even if defendant had filed the motion to dismiss in a timely manner, the instant court found defendant's constitutional claim to be without merit. Because police officers had reason to believe that defendant was either a witness to or a participant in a crime, they were within their lawful authority to detain defendant to resolve ambiguities in his conduct. Defendant's decision to disobey an officer's order and flee from the scene impeded the officer's duties. Thus, &sect; 719.1 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's conduct.

Respondent contends: (1) the district court erred in awarding the petitioner monthly alimony of $ 2000; and (2) the district court's award of attorney fees was excessive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to their marriage, the parties signed a prenuptial agreement. The parties agreed to waive any claim to the other's separately-owned property, whether this property was owned at the time of marriage or acquired during the marriage, as well as any claim for spousal support or alimony in the event of divorce. Fourteen years later, petitioner sought a divorce. The trial court found the agreement valid. The trial court apportioned jointly-owned property, and ordered respondent to pay alimony and attorney fees. The court of appeals affirmed as modified. The court of appeals found the prenuptial agreement to be enforceable. Also, the appellate court agreed with the trial court's decision regarding property distribution according to the terms of the agreement. Under the agreement all independently owned property was to remain with its owner. Pursuant to the agreement, all property not jointly owned was to be awarded to their owners. Petitioner was entitled to alimony, but the trial court's award of permanent alimony was excessive. Further, it was not an abuse of discretion to award petitioner attorney fees. However, no appellate attorney fees were awarded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant considered his wife's daughter to be his child, even though he was not the biological father. The child was placed in foster care, and a permanency plan was filed with the juvenile court recommending visitation for the child's biological parents. Appellant filed an objection to the plan, seeking visitation with the child as her legal father. The District Court, Linn County (Iowa) denied appellant's request for visitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the appellant contended that the juvenile court erred by denying him reasonable visitation with the minor child based on his status as her legal or established father. The court concluded that visitation with the appellant was not in the best interest of the minor child. Because the appellant was incarcerated, the minor child had not seen or interacted with him for more than 18 months and had no bond with him. Appellant was serving a sentence of 15 to 20 years, and therefore had no reasonable expectation of assuming a meaningful parenting role for the minor child during the period of her minority. Appellant's wife, who was also incarcerated, expressed a desire to divorce the appellant, and no longer wanted the appellant to take part in the child's life. The child's biological father, the only parent in her life who was not incarcerated, had stepped forward and taken an active role in her life. Additionally, the appellant's desire to make the minor child an important part of his life was contradicted by the fact that the appellant had no contact with his own biological children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The court held that the juvenile court did not err in denying appellant visitation. The court concluded based on the facts presented that it was not in the minor child's long-tern or immediate best interests to have visitation with the appellant.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from the district court's ruling affirming a special assessment imposed by the city, the plaintiff argues the assessment exceeds the special benefit conferred, the trial court erred in not considering impact fee analysis evidence, and the assessment was unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner filed an action to challenge appellee city's special assessment district and the amount of appellant's assessment imposed for a four-lane road construction in particular. The Iowa District Court for Dallas County's ruling affirmed the special assessment. Appellant challenged the ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owned a farm that bordered a two-lane road in a residentially developing area of appellee city. Appellee established an assessment district and special assessments for paving and complete reconstruction of the road as four-lane. Appellants challenged the $ 238,187 total assessment. Appellant argued the assessment violated Iowa Code &sect; 384.62 by exceeding 25 percent of the total agreed value of the improved property as an farm. The circuit court upheld the assessment. The appeals court affirmed. The appeals court determined, in part, that (1) there was a strong likelihood the property would soon be homesites, (2) the new road conferred a special benefit on the property less than the increase in value of the property as homesites, (3) the assessment was less than 25 percent of the total homesite value, and (4) Iowa law did not require an impact fee analysis, which was more appropriate for larger areas than single projects. The appeals court concluded the amount assessed was not unfair or inequitable. Appellee's actions to set the special assessment district boundaries, in accord with proper procedures previously established, were not palpably arbitrary or irrational.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ruling was affirmed. Appellee's legislative action to determine boundaries for the special assessment district was not arbitrary or irrational; the railroad was a natural southern boundary. Appellant did not overcome the presumption that the assessment was correct. The assessment was not unfair or inequitable, did not exceed the special benefit accrued to the property, and was less than the statutory 25 percent of value limit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile placed a gift-wrapped package containing a home-made bomb in an elementary school classroom. The package had one protruding fuse, a cigarette lighter, and a note attached to it. After a teacher discovered the package, law enforcement officials destroyed it. Appellant was convicted for first-degree arson. He appealed, arguing the arson statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 712.1 (1999), violated his right to due process because it was vague and overbroad, and the State did not prove the all of the elements of arson beyond a reasonable doubt. Specifically, appellant focused on the purported vagueness of the phrase &quot;combustible material&quot; in the arson statute. The court held a penal statute was vague where it did not define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people could understand what conduct was prohibited and in a manner that did not encourage arbitrary enforcement. However, the court affirmed, holding the statute was specific enough to provide guidance and fair notice to ordinary citizens of proscribed conduct and the State met its burden of proving every element of the offense to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

A requested urine sample revealed marijuana metabolites in his system. Based on the test results showing the metabolites were present, respondent Iowa Department of Transportation gave petitioner notice his license would be revoked for one year under Iowa Code &sect; 321J.12(1). The revocation was enhanced under Iowa Code &sect; 321J.2A because of a prior conviction entered before petitioner was 21 years old. Petitioner contested his license revocation, but it was administratively upheld. He appealed. The trial court upheld the revocation. Petitioner again appealed. The court affirmed. Petitioner's substantive due process rights were not violated because the statute prohibiting driving while having a controlled substance in one's system was rationally related to the governmental goal of protecting other drivers and was a valid exercise of the state's police power. Also, the statute allowing for the sentence to be enhanced did not violate petitioner's ex post facto rights because it did not punish what previously had been an innocent act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a two count trial information charging defendant with murder in the first degree and robbery in the first degree. The charges stemmed from the robbery and shooting death of the victim in his home. A jury returned verdicts of guilty on both counts. In affirming, the court determined that defendant suffered no prejudicial error as a result of the district court's refusal to amend the uniform jury instructions. The court determined that photo arrays were not impermissibly suggestive and the identification was reliable. An agent's statement was appropriately offered to show defendant's reaction to the agent's theory about a third person's role in the murder and robbery. The evidence was strong that defendant actually provided crack cocaine to the third person and his girlfriend. In turn, this evidence tended to prove defendant and the third person would be more likely to participate in a crime motivated by the desire to obtain drugs and money. Defendant could not show trial counsel breached an essential duty. Finally, the imposition of a fine of $ 150,000 was not excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Trial court did not err in refusing to modify jury instructions, photographic lineup was not unduly suggestive, evidence of crack cocaine sales was not more prejudicial than it was probative, counsel did not render ineffective assistance, and fine was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was pulled over by a police officer for a minor traffic infraction. The officer immediately suspected appellant was operating his vehicle under the influence (OWI) and arrested him. Appellant failed to submit to a chemical test and the officer invoked Iowa's implied consent law and issued a notice that his license be revoked, based on his refusal and a prior OWI arrest. Appellee department of transportation held a hearing on the officer's recommendation and concluded appellant's license should be revoked. Appellant challenged appellee's decision, arguing it was not supported by substantial evidence, was unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious, and that Iowa's statutory implied consent scheme violated substantive due process and the constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. The court noted appellee articulated the correct law, judiciously applied the law to the facts it chose to believe, and reached a reasoned conclusion; therefore, its actions were not arbitrary or capricious. The court went on to affirm, holding a person who was properly arrested had no valid U.S. Const. amend. IV objection to submission of body fluid specimens.</SPAN></P>

P. 10(10)(b) in denying defendant's motion for a change of venue because he failed to show the publicity created such a degree of prejudice in the county that there was a substantial likelihood a fair and impartial trial could not be had there; [3]-It was necessary to remand the case for a hearing to determine whether a conflict of interest existed by virtue of a relationship between defense counsel and an assistant county attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee officer requested permission to search appellant daughter's vehicle, after she left a hotel at which drug trafficking had been reported, and permission was granted. Appellee found nothing illegal, but transported her to the police station. Appellant mother went to the police station, with appellant son. Appellants mother and son were detained at the police station for three hours. Appellant daughter was detained there for six hours. Appellants sued appellees for false arrest and violation of civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court, after a trial, dismissed the complaint and appellants sought review. While the trial court's judgment upholding the initial stop of appellant daughter was upheld as not being patently unreasonable, appellee officer's transportation to the police station and continued detention of her after his unfruitful search of her vehicle was without constitutional authority. Appellee officer's detention of appellants mother and son was also unconstitutional, as he had no reason to suspect them of any wrongdoing, and detention of a citizen because they might warn a suspect was not constitutionally authorized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of appellants' complaint was reversed because the investigatory stop of appellant daughter became an arrest without probable cause when she was transported to the police station.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee of appellant retail food store corporation sold alcohol to a minor. Appellant was convicted under Iowa Code &sect; 123.49(2)(h), 123.50(1) (Supp. 1997) of selling alcoholic beverages to an underage patron. Those crimes were characterized as serious misdemeanors. The &sect; 123.50(1) conviction was a vicarious criminal conviction as it did not require a finding of appellant's fault. The convictions were reversed and remanded for dismissal. Section 123.50(1) was declared unconstitutional as it could not have survived a three-part public welfare analysis to circumvent due process requirements. Specifically the stigma to the appellant attached with conviction of the serious misdemeanor charge was grave and damaging to its corporate reputation. The violation of &sect; 123.49(2)(h) was reversed because there were no allegations appellant knew or failed to exercise reasonable care to ascertain whether the person was under legal age.</SPAN></P>
