</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was ticketed for operating a personal watercraft after hours, in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 86B.313, subd. 1(a)(2) (2000). His motion to dismiss the charge was denied, and after a trial, the Scott County District Court (Minnesota) entered a judgment of conviction. On appeal defendant challenged his conviction, arguing that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from his conviction for operating a personal watercraft within one hour of sunset in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 86B.313, subd. 1(a)(2) (2000), defendant claimed that statute was unconstitutionally vague and that there was no rational basis for such treatment of personal watercraft when there were no similar restrictions on other motorized watercraft. The court held that the trial court did not err in holding that &sect; 86B.313, subd. 1(a)(2), did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Minnesota or United States Constitutions, and that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. First, the court noted that the times of sunrise and sunset were readily available to watercraft operators in the Minnesota Boating Guide, in television weather reports, and in newspapers. Second, the court held that there was a rational basis for different treatment of personal watercraft. The statute's language clearly showed that its purpose was to promote public safety. Personal watercraft were substantially smaller and, arguably, more vulnerable than other motorboats; exceedingly maneuverable; and could be harder to see. Such distinctions were relevant to the public safety concern.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mother and husband (the mother), sued appellee county under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for violation of their constitutional rights and appellee school district for defamation. The District Court of Brown County, Minnesota, granted summary judgment against both claims. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's minor child was paralyzed and received special services from the school district. The child lived in a home that was titled in the child's name. A conservator managed the child's estate. The school district made a report of suspected child neglect based upon observations of the child. A sheriff's deputy contacted the conservator and obtained permission to search the residence. The search yielded evidence that was later used in a CHIPS action regarding the child. The mother argued that the deputy's action was unlawful because the conservator's consent was obtained by coercion, and that the district's report was defamatory. The appellate court held that there were no material issues of fact and that summary judgment was proper. Although the conservator had been reluctant to consent, there was no evidence that the deputy's statement that he had to search the home immediately was coercive. With the minor exception of two dates, the statements in the district's report were true and, therefore, could not be the basis of a defamation action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged a decision of the Anoka County District Court (Minnesota), which denied his motion for postconviction relief filed against respondent State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted City of Ham Lake, Minn., City Code &sect; 9-470 (2000), which declared it unlawful to operate a helicopter from certain land, including petitioner's land. Section 9-470.4 provided for an exception to the rule, which involved obtaining a favorable determination letter from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Petitioner received such a letter, but the letter contained conditions that petitioner was to abide by, including erecting certain warning signs. Only one small sign was erected. Petitioner was charged with violating the ordinance and convicted. He sought postconviction relief and claimed that the ordinance violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause. The court disagreed and affirmed. Petitioner was not singled out for prosecution. He was prosecuted because he did not meet the conditions of the FAA approval letter. The legitimate governmental purpose behind the ordinance was safety, so it was not facially unconstitutional. Because petitioner understood his need to comply with the FAA conditions to meet the exception to the rule, his argument that the ordinance was void for vagueness failed. The ordinance was not preempted by federal regulations.</SPAN></P>

The owner challenged the summary judgment granted in favor of the city on her due process and equal protection claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner filed an application to subdivide a residential lot. After the city denied her application, the owner filed a declaratory judgment action. The district court granted the city's motion for summary judgment on the owner's constitutional claims. However, it granted the owner's motion for summary judgment on the remaining challenge. Both parties then sought review. In reversing the summary judgment granted in favor of the owner, the court found that Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances &sect; 598.170(4) (1995) was not impermissibly vague. The application was denied, as one of the parcels would have been less than the 60-foot minimum required by &sect; 598.170(4). The term &quot;reverse frontage lots&quot; in &sect; 598.170(4) was not ambiguous, as the term had a particular, designated meaning in land-use regulation. The meaning was consistent with a legitimate legislative intent to preserve the integrity and uniformity of lots in the zoning district. Moreover, the district court did not violate the owner's due process rights. She had reasonable notice of all meetings and hearings and an opportunity to be heard. Finally, the court declined to consider the owner's equal protection challenge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment granted in favor of the owner. The rest of the district court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The father failed to demonstrate physical and emotional contact with the child, while the mother had demonstrated some physical contact, but failed to make emotional contact. The parents lacked an understanding of their parenting deficits, and those deficits were likely to continue into the foreseeable future. The parental capacity evaluations concluded that the mother did not know how to be nurturing, and that the father lacked the parenting skills necessary to care for a child. Additionally, the father had a sporadic employment history, and was unlikely to have stable employment in the foreseeable future. Similarly, the mother was not employed, and lacked the training and prospects for stable employment. That evidence established that the parents were unable to address the child's physical, mental, and emotional needs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced in the Dakota County District Court (Minnesota).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband asked the district court to declare every statute in Minnesota unconstitutional that violated his constitutionally protected equal right to be an equal parent. As a threshold matter, the appellate court noted that the issue was not properly before the court. The husband failed to notify the attorney general of his challenge to the constitutionality of a statute as required by Minn. R. Civ. App. P. 144. Failure to notify the attorney general limited the constitutional challenge to an &quot;as applied&quot; challenge. In alleging that he had a constitutional right to be an &quot;equal parent,&quot; however, the husband ignored the legal standard governing all child custody determinations: the best interests of the child. Because the statutes focused on the best interests of children, rather than the rights of parents, the husband's argument did not show them to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the police department's policy of having all traffic violators sit in the back of the squad car did not justify his placement in the squad car. Nonetheless, the appellate court concluded that it was reasonable for the officer, who was alone at the scene of an early-morning traffic stop, to have defendant sit in the back of the squad car while he checked on his identity and the status of his license. This was a practical way for the officer to effectively accomplish the lawful task of detaining defendant for the time permitted to run the check and issue the tickets. Defendant did not assert, and no evidence suggested, that the officer made the request merely to facilitate an otherwise impermissible search. Because defendant was not illegally seized when he was placed in the back of the squad car, the appellate court held that the drugs he abandoned in the squad car were not the fruit of an illegal seizure and the trial court did not err by denying the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner contended that he has produced sufficient evidence under the three-part statutory test to carry his burden of going forward. Petitioner asserted that his unrebutted testimony indicated that he would be able to assimilate into the American Indian community. Nevertheless, petitioner had no discharge plan that provided a reasonable degree of protection to society, other than his promise to live within the traditions of his Native American culture. Merely filing a petition for discharge and self-serving testimony that a transition would be easy was insufficient to meet petitioner's burden. Petitioner also contended that, because the psychologist expressed uncertainty regarding whether commitment was originally appropriate, an appellate court should conclude that the petitioner not dangerous to the community today. The appellate court concluded that his diagnoses, the reports, and the psychologist's opinion that defendant had not changed since his original commitment, demonstrated petitioner's continuing high degree of risk to the community. Finally, the absence of a lack-of-control component in Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.18, subd. 15 (2000), did not render it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of four gross misdemeanor counts of driving while under the influence. The misdemeanor offenses were enhanced to gross misdemeanors, pursuant to &sect; 169A.03, because of the revocation of her Minnesota driver's license following her 1995 Wisconsin DWI conviction. She appealed, and the issue on appeal was whether the enhancement of defendant's DWI offense based on the prior revocation of her Minnesota driver's license following an uncounseled Wisconsin guilty plea to DWI violated her constitutional right to due process. The court held that it did not and affirmed. The Commissioner of Public Safety was directed to revoke a person's Minnesota driver's license following conviction for DWI in another state. Minn. Stat. &sect; 171.17 subd. 1(9) (2002). Defendant's Minnesota driver's license was revoked in 1995 following the Wisconsin conviction and she did not petition for judicial review, and the revocation of her driver's license therefore went unchallenged. The district court found that the charges against defendant were enhanced because of the prior license revocation, not the Wisconsin conviction, and therefore the Nordstrom/Friedrich prohibition was not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a traffic stop, police conducted a warrantless search of defendant's person.

A handgun was later found during an inventory search of defendant's car conducted incident to his arrest. The district court found that defendant consented to the search of his person. Defendant argued on appeal that his consent to the search was not voluntary. Defendant pointed to the fact that the stop was for a minor equipment violation, at 2:00 a.m., that two officers were present, that he did not believe he had a right to refuse the request to search his person, and that the police did not permit him to leave the traffic stop. The appellate court held that the district court's finding was not clearly erroneous. Defendant's testimony indicated that he had not consented because of something the police did, but that he consented to the search because he believed that he had no other choice. The fact that defendant did not know that he had a right to refuse did not render his consent involuntary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sustained a work-related injury to his back. He received workers' compensation benefits and disability benefits. After he reached retirement age, the employee sought to have his disability benefits converted into an ordinary retirement pension under Minn. Stat. &sect; 352.93, subd. 1 (2000). He also sought health insurance benefits. The employer objected to the termination of disability benefits. The district court determined that the action was barred by collateral estoppel, and it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case. However, it also entered judgment in favor of the employer. In reversing, the court determined that the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not apply because the issue was not identical to a constitutional issue he raised in an prior proceeding. Moreover, the district court had jurisdiction over the case because the employee's claim regarding statutory interpretation did not fall under the jurisdiction of the workers' compensation system. The court declined to determine whether or not the employee was eligible for retirement and health insurance, but remanded the case for the consideration of further issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant beside a disabled car. Defendant was subsequently arrested on outstanding warrants. Later, police returned to the vehicle for the purpose of having it towed. During a search of the trunk, items used in the manufacture of methamphetamine were discovered. Defendant was then charged with several drug-related offenses. After his conviction, defendant sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the police conducted a valid inventory search of the car. The fact that the interior of the car was not searched was irrelevant, as police department policy allowed an inventory search of the trunk. Moreover, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in requiring defendant to wear a leg restraint during his trial. The trial court properly considered defendant's health, his past crimes, and the seriousness of the charges against him when making the decision. The court also found that there was sufficient evidence presented to sustain defendant's conviction under Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.021, subd. 2a (2002) and Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.17, subd. 1 (2002).

In addition, an expert designated the patient a &quot;clinical psychopath&quot; and placed him in the top 18 percent of prisoners in terms of severity of psychopathy. Further, experts diagnosed the patient with paraphilia, and the trial court found that the patient had that disorder.

Both rapes were committed when the patient was intoxicated, yet he did not participate in chemical dependency treatment during his incarceration.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of criminal sexual conduct in two counties, resulting from a series of nearly identical rapes. Defendant challenged the district court's sentencing order, claiming that his sentence was improper. The appellate court disagreed with defendant's assertion that the district court improperly sentenced him under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1352 (1996) (recodified Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.108 (1998)) after that section had been repealed, because no due-process problem existed when his sentence never exceeded the statutory maximum.  Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1352 was reenacted and recodified as Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.108 in substantially the same terms, and, because the patterned sex-offender statute was codified as Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1352 at the time that the Dakota County offense occurred, its use by the district court was appropriate. Furthermore, defendant's second sentencing hearing under the patterned-sex-offender statute did not operate as an ex post facto law or bill of attainder when the recodification of the statute did not create a new crime or increase the burden of punishment, and the statute did not permit the infliction of punishment without a judicial trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen was arrested for gross misdemeanor driving while impaired; at the time of her arrest her blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was .29, she had a similar arrest seven months before. The city started forfeiture proceedings against the citizen's car. At the evidentiary hearing, the trial court examined the citizen's financial status; she had been laid off nine months prior and had used part of her severance package to buy her car. She was still unemployed at the time she was arrested and had little or no assets and credit card debt. The district court issued an order concluding that the car forfeiture would be &quot;unconstitutionally excessive&quot; because of its impact on the citizen. The appellate court reversed the trial court's order and held the forfeiture was not excessive as (1) the dangerousness of her conduct provided the type of gravity the forfeiture statute was intended to address and the trial court's consideration of her financial condition was in error; (2) the forfeiture of a $ 16,000 car was not excessive when compared to the maximum fine possible for a gross misdemeanor; and (3) Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.63 (2000) was similar to forfeiture statutes in other states.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the district court was reversed, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings with instructions to order the citizen's car to be forfeited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officers responded to an anonymous call reporting a suspicious vehicle in the parking lot of an apartment complex. The officers had no description of, or details concerning, the vehicle or possible criminal activity of the occupants. The officers observed defendant's vehicle, legally parked, with its engine running. Defendant was observed sleeping in the driver's seat. One of the officers knocked on the window and ordered defendant to roll the window down. Defendant appeared unable to comply, and one of the officers opened the door and instructed defendant to step out of the vehicle. Defendant failed several field sobriety tests and refused to submit to chemical testing. Defendant argued that the actions of the officers constituted an unconstitutional warrantless seizure within the meaning of Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The appellate court ruled there was nothing in the record to establish a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot or that an emergency situation existed. The anonymous tip did not provide an adequate basis for reasonable, articulable suspicion that defendant was, had been, or was about to be engaging in criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

Police went to defendant's home, where he ultimately gave consent to search. Several weapons were found, and he was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm. Later, defendant contended that the consent to search was involuntarily given. He also claimed that the application of Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.713, subd. 1(b) (2000), violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. After his conviction, defendant sought review. In affirming, the court determined that &sect; 624.713, subd. 1(b), did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of either the United States or Minnesota Constitutions because it did not punish an act that was innocent when it was committed. Defendant's prior felony conviction for drugs was not a &quot;crime of violence&quot; when he was convicted in 1986; however, it was added as such in 1987. Section 624.713, subd. 1(b), did not affect defendant's prior drug conviction. Only his status had changed, which made him subject to &sect; 624.713, subd. 1(b). Moreover, the consent to search was valid. The court gave deference to the trial court's determination that defendant's allegations regarding a threat were not credible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner sent the operator notice that her license was being revoked. She was informed of her right to appeal. However, her appeal was not accepted because it was not received within the time period under Minn. Stat. &sect; 245A.07, subd. 3(a) (2000). The operator claimed that the appeal process violated procedural due process rights. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court noted the government's interest in protecting the health and safety of children at state-licensed day care facilities by quickly resolving licensing disputes. The court found that this interest outweighed the minimal risk that the statute might cause an erroneous deprivation of a protected interest. Thus, the court held that the statute provided constitutionally adequate procedural due process protections. The court noted that there had been an amendment to the statute that provided that an appeal was timely if it was postmarked within a certain time. However, there was no reason to retroactively apply the statute pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 645.21 (2000).</SPAN></P>

A first computer search on defendant was faulty and failed to identify him. The officer performed a pat-down search on defendant, where he found two wallets, one of which was stolen. Defendant was convicted of theft, but the court reversed his conviction. The court found that the officer's search violated defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The officer's search of defendant was not incident to a lawful arrest. It was not reasonable for the officer to mistake defendant for his brother because the description of the brother was vague, and there was no probable cause to arrest defendant for giving a false name. Because the officer removed the wallet in an attempt to identify defendant, not because he thought it was a weapon, he exceeded the lawful scope of the search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the student challenged his expulsion. Contrary to the student's contention, the appellate court found the school district's weapons policy was not preempted by Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.66, subd. 1d. (2000). Further, there was no conflict between the statute and the school policy where the statute did not permit the student to avoid the school disciplinary process and the school policy did not permit the school to initiate criminal proceedings. Although the student's notice was defective under the Pupil Fair Dismissal Act, Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 121A.40-.56 (2000), there was no evidence that the mistakes made were not made in good faith; the record supported the finding that the student failed to demonstrate he suffered any prejudice as a result. The record also supported the commissioner's conclusion that the student's right to confront witnesses was not violated and that sufficient competent evidence supported the uncontested determination that the student had a shotgun in his car in the school parking lot. The school's policy was not overbroad or vague and the decision to expel was neither arbitrary nor capricious, even though the school had an option to impose a lesser penalty.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion, concluding that the stop was constitutional because a tipster was not anonymous, and the officer observed the vehicle being driven at a slow rate of speed. Defendant waived his right to a jury trial and submitted his case to the court on stipulated facts. The trial court found him guilty of second-degree DWI and driving after revocation. The appeal followed. The appellate court concluded, given the minimal factual basis required for an investigatory stop and the deference to the officer's rational inferences, that the officer properly considered defendant's slow speed as a basis for forming a reasonable suspicion. Considering the totality of the circumstances, the appellate court concluded the officer had reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction and that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.506, subd. 2, was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court found that the record contained sufficient evidence to permit a jury to find defendant guilty. Police officers asked defendant for identification after he twice invited a police officer working undercover as a prostitution decoy to come to his home for drugs. Defendant gave the name and birth date of his cousin. After consenting to a search that resulted in the discovery of a crack pipe, defendant was placed under arrest and then gave his true name and birth date. The court also found that &sect; 609.506, subd. 2, was definite enough so that ordinary people could understand what conduct was prohibited, and therefore, it was not unconstitutionally vague. Under the statute, a police officer must have at least a suspicion of possible criminal activity in order to make a lawful investigatory stop. Defendant's giving a false name in order to avoid arrest or investigation was sufficient to show an intentional obstruction of justice under the statute.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 512.021, subd.1(1); 609.229, subds. 2, 3, 4; 609.05, subd. 1 (2000), and of racketeering in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 609.903, subd. 1(1); 609.904, subd. 1, 2 (2000).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State offered testimony that defendant transported approximately one ounce of suspected crack cocaine between two cities. Defendant was convicted of the offenses charged, but he argued on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. The court agreed. With regard to the crime involving the sale of a controlled substance, the court noted that no crack cocaine was seized that defendant allegedly transported, and thus no scientific tests were conducted. Because neither the identify nor the exact weight of the crack cocaine was scientifically ascertained, and no witness observed it, the jury could not have reasonably concluded that the State proved the identity and weight of the crack cocaine. It was immaterial that this was a delivery and distribution type of sale instead of other types of sales. While the court agreed with the State's interpretation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.902, subd. 4 (2000), that any amount of crack cocaine would constitute a felony offense sufficient to qualify as a predicate act for a charge of racketeering, because the court reversed the controlled substance sale conviction, the court also reversed the racketeering conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the district court's presiding referee improperly admitted a police report and did not allow him to cross-examine the children at his hearing. The police report described an incident in which the father struck his two children with a belt. The referee ruled that because the report had &quot;St. Paul Police Department Offense Report&quot; printed on it, and was dated and signed by the reporting officer, it was authentic and would be admitted pursuant to Minn. R. Evid. 1005 and 902. The appellate court disagreed with the referee's holding and ruled that the police report was not properly authenticated, and the referee abused his discretion in admitting the report. The police report did not bear a seal, nor was there any testimony by the officer or other evidence attesting to the authenticity of the report. However, the appellate court ruled that the referee did not abuse his discretion in preventing the father from cross-examining the children. Furthermore, the father's due process argument failed because his case was reviewed and confirmed by a district court judge, and the father was then allowed review by the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the statute proscribing excessively tinted windows was unconstitutional, applied the exclusionary rule, and suppressed all of the evidence. The appellate court found that the exclusionary rule did not apply when the police discovered evidence after an arrest based on a presumptively valid statute because there was no police misconduct that required application of the exclusionary rule for its deterrent effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the trial court erred by failing to suppress exculpatory statements he made while in custody and by failing to suppress letters written while incarcerated.

The appellate court initially noted the statements defendant made were properly admitted because when he was detained, he failed to unambiguously exercise his right to remain silent. The appellate court held defendant had no expectation of privacy when writing letters from prison. The appellate court further held because defendant's sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum, his departure sentence was not unconstitutional. The appellate court concluded the trial court did err by computing defendant's criminal-history score because the State did not meet its burden of proving that his prior juvenile convictions were felony-level offenses, warranting a criminal-history point.</SPAN></P>

The Dakota County District Court, Minnesota, granted the injunction and the residents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the residents argued that the First Amendment protected their &quot;protest activities&quot; and that as the injunction order covered speech not yet uttered, it was an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech. The appellate court found that the order's no-contact provision was content-neutral; the fact that the order prohibited contact was not per se an impingement on the residents' constitutionally protected speech. However, the trial court's findings were insufficient to establish that the residents' conduct met the statutory definition of harassment. As the order's future-conduct provision enjoined the residents from displaying, erecting, distributing, publishing, or mailing materials before those materials had been judicially determined to be outside the scope of the First Amendment's protection, and as the owners failed to show that a compelling state interest supported that portion of the order, the future-conduct provision was an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech. The no-trespassing provision of the order was proper as it related to the owners' property, but the owners did not have standing to enjoin the residents from trespassing on public property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The future-conduct provision of the injunction order was vacated; the no-contact provision was remanded for reconsideration; and the no-trespassing provision was remanded for modification to prohibit the residents from trespassing only on the owners' property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166, subds. 1(a)(1)(iii), 3(a) (1998), did not apply to homeless people, the record did not contain a factual basis for his plea, and he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. The appellate court found that defendant took advantage of a plea agreement so that he would not be subject to a mandatory minimum prison term. The record contained a sufficient factual basis for the plea as defendant was aware of the requirement and had pleaded guilty to one violation of the requirement, yet made no attempt to comply with the statute. Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was without merit because defendant's attorney did bring a motion to dismiss specifically challenging the applicability of the statute to a homeless defendant. Defendant's conditions of probation were modified to require defendant to comply with the statute by reporting each change of living location.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Hennepin County District Court entered an order committing appellant patient as a sexually dangerous person (SDP). After appeal to the instant court, review and remand by the Minnesota Supreme Court, and another appeal of the district court's amended order, the United States Supreme Court, following release of its opinion in Kansas v. Crane, granted certiorari and remanded the case to the instant court for further consideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was whether the patient was properly committed as a sexually dangerous person under the civil commitment standard, as clarified in the United States Supreme Court decision in Kansas v. Crane. There, the United States Supreme Court held the constitution required some finding on lack of control before a sexual offender could be civilly committed. That court, however, declined to give to the phrase &quot;lack of control&quot; a particularly narrow or technical meaning. Under Crane, such a finding, if it established a &quot;serious difficulty&quot; in controlling behavior, adequately distinguished the offender subject to commitment from the &quot;typical recidivist&quot; offender. In the instant case, the appellate court noted one expert's diagnosis of the patient as suffering from hebephilia, defined as a sexual attraction to teens, specifically male teens, against whom he used intimidation, trickery, or force to accomplish sexual offenses. The expert noted the patient likely had an utter lack of control over such behaviors. The appellate court held that the district court made the &quot;lack of control&quot; finding that was constitutionally required under Crane for the civil commitment of the patient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying action arose when appellant city commenced condemnation proceedings pursuant to St. Paul, Minn., City Charter ch. 13, to acquire easements over property owned by respondent foreign corporation.

The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the city argued that St. Paul, Minn., City Charter ch. 13, met the constitutional requirement that private property not be taken for public use before just compensation was paid. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the charter did not prevent the taking from occurring until a trial court reviewed the public purpose and necessity of the taking; it simply required that money be paid into court. When the payment was made, title to the property passed to the city. The charter did not provide for judicial review before the actual taking occurred. Even if the corporation conceded that the street project was for a public purpose, as the city asserted, there was no evidence that the corporation conceded that the project was necessary. Therefore, the corporation did not induce the city to believe that the corporation would not seek judicial review of the necessity of the taking. Furthermore, the corporation brought a mandamus action and sought appeal of the taking before the city began construction. Therefore, the city had ample notice that corporation was contesting the taking before construction began.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that the trial court erred by (1) finding that a photo that the victim allegedly posed for was not &quot;new evidence&quot; warranting a new trial, and (2) in not allowing the inmate to present Spreigl evidence to impeach the victim's credibility. The inmate also attacked the constitutionality of the statutory prohibition against instructing the jury that criminal sexual conduct was a crime easily charged but difficult to disprove. The appellate court affirmed the denial of the petition. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in finding that the photo was not new evidence as the inmate knew of the alleged photo at the time of his trial, and there was no evidence that the photo was actually of the victim. Also, introduction of the photo into evidence would not likely have produced an acquittal or more favorable result. The court also held that the trial court did not err by denying the inmate the right to introduce Spreigl evidence regarding the victim's prior accusation against the inmate, as the evidence was known at the time of the inmate's direct appeal. The constitutionality argument was not raised at the postconviction proceeding and was waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the search that produced the cocaine was not reasonably related in scope to the purpose of the traffic stop. At trial, the officer testified that he had no information about defendant that would indicate he had contraband in his pockets, and he saw nothing that caused him to suspect that defendant had anything illegal or dangerous in his pockets. The appellate court found the question about the content of defendant's pockets was not reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place (speeding); therefore, the resulting detention and inquiry were unreasonable. Further, evidence demonstrated that the officer had no reasonable, articulable suspicion that defendant was carrying a weapon or that other criminal activity was occurring that would justify expanding the scope of the speeding investigation. Accordingly, the marijuana discovered as a result of this questioning was the product of an invalid search. Because the marijuana provided the basis for the further search that produced the cocaine, that search was likewise invalid; therefore, the cocaine should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the search was lawful under the inventory-search and plain-view exceptions to the warrant requirement of the United States and Minnesota Constitutions. The officer's decision to impound and inventory the van was pursuant to unwritten department policy, and was reasonable because it was not undertaken purely for investigative purposes.

Defendant had bloodshot eyes, was nervous, gave conflicting answers to the officer's questions, and denied having drugs in the vehicle. Defendant agreed to let the officer search the van. As defendant exited the van, the officer saw a bulge in defendant's pants. Defendant tried to cover the bulge and kept at least one hand in a pocket. The officer did a pat-down of defendant and found four bags of methamphetamine. The appellate court held that the seizure was lawful. The traffic violation gave the officer grounds for the initial stop, and defendant's actions gave the officer grounds to continue to question defendant after the officer determined that defendant had a valid license. Defendant's consent to search the van was voluntary, and defendant's furtive gestures justified the pat-down.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with refusing to submit to chemical testing in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2 (2000). The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charge on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State contended the trial court erred in dismissing the charge against defendant because Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2, (2000): did not violate defendant's right to privacy or right against self-incrimination; was supported by a rational basis test; did not violate defendant's right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures; was not void for vagueness; and was not overbroad on its face. The appellate court agreed, finding that because the legislature had a compelling state interest in protecting residents from drunk driving and the act of testing was an important part of the implementation of that interest, the limited intrusion was justified. Further, other courts had already concluded that there was no Fifth Amendment right to refuse testing and the refusal statute did not violate a defendant's right against self-incrimination. Because a criminal statute could reference parts of a civil statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.52 (2000) was sufficiently definite. Because &sect; 169A.52 required probable cause, a refusal was criminal in the limited context of when an officer had probable cause to suspect a person had been drinking and driving; thus, it was not overbroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had a 20-year history of violence, including sexual assaults on his wife and step-daughter, and non-sexual assaults and murder. He was diagnosed with alcohol and cocaine dependence and antisocial personality disorder. The experts described appellant as &quot;hypersexual&quot; and &quot;sexually preoccupied,&quot; extremely dangerous, and likely to reoffend very quickly. Both experts found that appellant lacked adequate ability to control his sexual impulses. The appellate court found that: (1) Minnesota Commitment and Treatment Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02 (2000), specifically at Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c, met the standard for civil commitment of sexually dangerous persons set forth in the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court; (2) the phrases &quot;lack of adequate control&quot; and &quot;course of harmful sexual conduct&quot; were not vague as interpreted or applied; (3) the findings of the district court regarding harmful sexual conduct were not erroneous and were supported by the evidence; and (4) there was no abuse of discretion in admitting the testimony of appellant's stepdaughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant utility company brought a mandamus and declaratory judgment action against respondent city to compel the city to approve its application for a conditional use permit (CUP) under the automatic approval provisions of Minn. Stat. &sect; 15.99 (2000). The Dakota County District Court (Minnesota) concluded the utility company was equitably estopped from asserting its right to automatic approval of the CUP under &sect; 15.99. The utility appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility company applied for the CUP to upgrade an existing transmission line running through the city. A group of private citizens who lived near the existing line appeared as intervenors in the action in support of the city's position. The primary issues were: (1) whether the district court erred by concluding that the utility by its conduct approved an extension of the deadline for approval of it's application or waived its rights under Minn. Stat. &sect; 15.99, and (2) whether the city could deny the utility's permit based on a franchise ordinance. The appellate court held: (1) the city could not prove reasonable reliance as a basis the utility was estopped from enforcing a mutually agreed upon deadline for a decision where the city failed to act before that date by either seeking the utility's approval of another extension or by acting on the utility's permit application; (2) as to waiver, the burden was on the city to act within the statutory deadline or to request an additional extension; and (3) where the city gave no explanation for the enactment of its franchise ordinance, the city was precluded from relying on its later enacted franchise ordinance to deny the permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on two courts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct in the Le Sueur County District Court (Minnesota). Defendant appealed, arguing the district court abused its discretion in: (1) denying his motion for a change of venue based on his minority status and the demographics of the county in which the offense occurred, (2) allowing certain offenses for impeachment purposes, and (3) imposing a potentially excessive sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved for a change of venue to a county with a higher percentage of racial minority residents. The district court denied the motion. On appeal, the appellate court held that: (1) because defendant did not show that he suffered actual prejudice resulting from the jury's racial composition, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for change of venue; (2) the appellate court could not speculate about what the scope of defendant's testimony on direct examination might have been regarding past sexual relations with young girls, and therefore, the trial court did not err in ruling the prosecution could question defendant about prior sexual relationships with girls under the age of 16 if defendant took the stand; (3) under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.108 the trial court was not required to make any additional findings beyond those listed in the statute as to aggravating circumstances justifying a maximum sentence; and (4) application of a 10-year conditional release term on top of the 15-year sentence, the statutory maximum, created an unresolvable conflict, and to avoid unconstitutional application of law, the conditional release time had to be reduced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's third-degree criminal sexual conduct convictions, but reversed the sentence in count 2 which imposed a 10-year conditional release term, and remanded for resentencing in a manner not inconsistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted for two counts of first-degree aggravated robbery and three counts of first-degree burglary and sentenced as a dangerous offender and career offender to 20 years for each conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court violated the rule of Apprendi by sentencing him as a dangerous and career offender without a jury determination of the facts that resulted in his increased sentence. Although his sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum, the defendant argued that his sentence was unconstitutional, as it exceeded the presumptive sentence under the sentencing guidelines. The defendant also contended that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his request for a hearing. The appellate court rejected the defendant's argument. Apprendi applied only to situations where a trial court sentenced the defendant to a time period that exceeded the statutory maximum. The defendant's sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant's petition for postconviction relief. Additionally, the defendant's postconviction motion was not based on factual allegations, but only a legal issue, the application of Apprendi. Because Apprendi did not apply to the defendant's case, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant a hearing.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the officer's search of the garage was hardly divorced from investigation. Indeed, the reverse was true because, as the State correctly noted, the officer did not know what the smell was and felt he had to &quot;check it out.&quot; The State's argument that the community-caretaker exception applied to the officer's search of the garage was without merit. Therefore, the search violated defendant's constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Therefore, the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant admitted that he violated the law and was unable to challenge the fact that the officer had a ground to stop him for a taillight violation. To hold that defendant needed only show that he was a member of a suspect class, without requiring proof of intentional discrimination, would effectively have allowed any member of a suspect class, simply by membership in that class, to avoid prosecution for a routine traffic violation. In order to sustain his burden of production to obtain a discriminatory-enforcement hearing, defendant would have had to produce specific evidence showing that he in particular, as an African-American driver, was targeted for a traffic stop because of his race. That would have included evidence that similarly situated Caucasian drivers were not stopped for similar violations. He was unable to meet that burden. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a discriminatory-enforcement hearing.</SPAN></P>

The commissioner denied the individuals' request for reconsideration, and the individuals appealed by certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record showed that the individuals violated capacity rules on 12 different occasions and had their license placed on probation twice. The record also showed abundant evidence that licensing workers repeatedly emphasized the seriousness of capacity violations and warned the individuals that additional violations would lead to negative licensing action. The administrative law judge found no indication that the individuals would comply with capacity rules in the future. The appellate court found that: (1) the commissioner did not abuse his statutory authority or his discretion in revoking the child-care license after a correction order had been issued for the violation that triggered the revocation order; (2) the licensing scheme was rationally related to the goal of promoting the safety of children in licensed programs; (3) the commissioner's order was not arbitrary or capricious, and it was fair in light of the continued violation of the rules despite numerous correction orders and two probationary periods; and (4) there was no evidentiary support for the individuals claim of disparate-treatment.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed. The police could ask defendant, a passenger, if he had a driver's license and if he was the licensed driver responsible for the person driving the car who had only a beginner's permit. But, the police could not then ask defendant for any type of identification, briefly detain him, and use that identification for a warrants check when, admittedly, they had no suspicion, nor claimed any, that defendant was engaged in criminal activity. Defendant was seized when police took his identification and ran a warrants check. The police lacked reasonable articulable suspicion that defendant was engaged in criminal activity to support defendant's seizure, when he was merely a passenger in a vehicle that was stopped for an equipment violation and he had engaged in no suspicious behavior. Therefore, the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the defendant argued that suppression of the evidence was required, because his arrest was in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 629.31 (2000), which governed the time of day when arrests may be made and prohibited misdemeanor arrests before 8:00 a.m.. The appellate court held that the violation of statute was minor, did not implicate the defendant's constitutional rights, and did not subvert the purpose of the statute. The defendant was arrested only 30 to 45 minutes before 8:00 a.m., not in the middle of the night, and police knew that he was in the apartment, because he had just made a call from that address minutes before he was arrested. Further, there was no indication that anyone was sleeping, undressed, or otherwise indisposed. Therefore, the police acted reasonably, and the intrusion upon the defendant's privacy was no more alarming than had they waited until after 8:00 a.m.</SPAN></P>

The Clay County District Court (Minnesota) awarded the landowner $ 819 in rental value and the jury awarded the landowner $ 50,000 in punitive damages for the tract owner's trespass. The tract owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Despite the absence of the parcel in the tract owner's deed, and the fact a plat map showed the property belonged the landowner, the tract owner trespassed upon the parcel and effectively prevented the landowner from planting echinacea for two years. Based upon this evidence, the jury could have based its finding that the tract owner intentionally disregarded facts that proved he did not own the property. This was sufficient to allow for punitive damages. The punitive damages award was not grossly excessive because the trial court made specific findings and found the tract owner's trespass intentionally disregarded the landowner's right to the free use and enjoyment of their property. Moreover, the punitive-damages award was necessary to punish the tract owner and to deter future similar conduct. Finally, the ratio between the awards was not unreasonable because a proportional rule did not have to apply to a small compensatory-damage award. Finally, the trial court's determination that compensatory damages was the reasonable rental value of the property was proper, because it was too speculative to the value of the crop to determine a reasonable lost-profit award.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the State asserted the trial court erred in finding that the affirmative defense unconstitutionally required defendants to prove the age of the person in the pornographic work. The appellate court initially noted the affirmative defense only required defendants to make a prima facie showing that the age of the person was a disputed issue, at which point the burden shifted back to the State to disprove the defense.

The officer recognized defendant's name as someone he previously arrested in a hotel room with narcotics and a weapon. A record check on defendant produced five active warrants, including one nightcapped warrant. Defendant was placed under arrest and handcuffed. A search of the hotel room produced a nine-millimeter semi-automatic handgun under the mattress. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the search incident to arrest, the admissibility of a computer printout of his arrest warrant, and the propriety of executing the warrant at night. The court ruled that the search comported with constitutional requirements, the printout was admissible under an exception to the best-evidence rule, and the warrant was nightcapped consistent with statutory authority.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's supporting affidavit alleged that she had employment opportunities in Hawaii, her older child had an interest in marine biology, and she would facilitate the father's visitation with the children in Hawaii. The appellate court ruled that, although the dissolution judgment did not create a parenting plan, as defined by Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.1705 (2000), it would deny the motion under Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.175, subd. 3 (Supp. 2001). The record supported the finding that the mother's purpose in seeking to move the children's residence from Minnesota was to interfere with the father's parenting time, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the mother's motion. The mother had no firm job offer in her field in Hawaii, and it was highly speculative that a new schedule of parenting time would allow the father to retain his relationship with the children in light of the attendant transportation cost and both parties' unemployed status. Also, the parties' son, whose interest in marine biology was advanced in support of the move, was only six years old.</SPAN></P>

Defendant determined which patients would be transported daily from their residences to the office or residence of her husband, a psychologist. In order to arrange for the maximum number of patients to be seen in a day, defendant directed a patient at one residence to line up other patients to facilitate a fast turn around, ordered that patients be given unnecessary psychological tests, and that testing of patients be stopped after expiration of a reimbursable time period under Medicaid rules. A reasonable factfinder could have concluded that defendant intended to establish and operate her company so as to wrongfully obtain Medicaid funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state filed an action against respondent insurers under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 115B.39-.445 (2000), the Minnesota Landfill Cleanup Act (LCA), and the cost-recovery provisions of the Minnesota Environmental Response and Liability Act (MERLA) for cleaning up two landfills. The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, granted the insurers summary judgment. The state appealed. The insurers appealed denials of prior summary judgment motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found that in 1982-84 the state knew of contamination at the two sites; thus its claims were time-barred as of 1988-90 by MERLA's statute of limitations. The appellate court found that Minn. Stat. &sect; 115B.11 (1984) prescribed a discovery-accrual rule only for damage actions for death, personal injury, and disease, while remaining silent on other MERLA causes of action, including for cost-recovery. Given the state's strong policy to liberally construe environmental protection law, and that the state knew of many landfills causing water-pollution problems before MERLA was even enacted, the legislature intended for a cause of action to recover response costs incurred by the state to accrue at the time of on-site construction of a permanent response action (1995-96 in this instance). The insurers failed to make a threshold showing of impairment under the Contracts Clause. There was no preemption by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The LCA neither directly nor indirectly unconstitutionally burden the Commerce Clause. The settling insurer had known that its insured could not execute a release without state consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Denial of the insurers' summary judgment motions relating to their constitutional claims, and one insurer's motion based on a settlement agreement with an insured, was affirmed. The grant of summary judgment because of a time-bar was reversed and the cause was remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While on patrol, two police officers observed defendant's vehicle fail to stop at a posted stop sign. The officers initiated a traffic stop and defendant refused to show any identification. Following a pat search, an officer took defendant's identification out of his wallet and issued him a ticket for failing to obey a semaphore. On appeal, defendant argued the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his conviction and that the initial traffic stop was a result of unconstitutional racial profiling. The appellate court initially noted, in considering a claim of insufficient evidence, an appellate court's review was limited to an analysis of the record to determine whether the evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the conviction, sufficiently supported the fact finder's verdict. The appellate court held there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction, as the stop sign was clearly posted, and two officers observed the traffic infraction. The appellate court concluded defendant's racial profiling argument was not preserved for appellate review, as he failed to argue the issue in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The defendant admitted strangling the victim with his bare hands, not with a knotted pillowcase, as concluded by the State's forensic expert. That discrepancy with the State's forensic evidence, however, was not fatal. The critical concern was whether the record supported a finding that the defendant actually committed a crime at least as serious as the crime to which he pleaded guilty. Whether the defendant used his bare hands or a knotted pillowcase, he admitted to both strangling and beating the victim to death. He unequivocally stated that he killed her. While he initially denied that he intended to kill her, upon questioning, he stated that he was pleading guilty to second-degree intentional murder and believed that his continued strangling of the victim until she lost consciousness implied that intent. In short, he agreed that his actions could have reasonably been construed as intentional. Therefore, the trial court did not err by denying the motion to withdraw the guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

Because the legislature had a compelling state interest in protecting state residents from drunk drivers, and an important part of the implementation of that interest was the testing of those whom officers had probable cause to believe had been drinking and were driving while impaired, the balancing test favored intrusion by the State on privacy rights held by the defendant. A compelling state interest was involved, and the defendant's right to privacy, to whatever degree it existed, was justifiably subject to intrusion. In addition, the court of appeals found that because the defendant was not in custody, Miranda rights did not attach, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the defendant's refusal to perform field sobriety tests into evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the district court erred by admitting into evidence results of her breath test, and by using her 1991 DWI conviction and civil license revocation to enhance her current DWI offense to a gross misdemeanor. The appellate court found that the Intoxilyzer 5000, Series 68-01 was an appropriate testing instrument and there was no abuse of discretion by allowing evidence regarding the Intoxilizer test and its results into evidence. Furthermore, defendant's arguments regarding evidence of her 1991 DWI conviction and license revocation for enhancement purposes failed. First, defendant did not adequately challenge the use of the 1991 conviction and defendant had the burden of properly challenging the constitutional validity of the prior conviction or revocation. Secondly, even if defendant's 1991 DWI conviction had been unconstitutionally obtained, her 1991 license revocation would have been enough to support an enhanced conviction since the lack of a full opportunity to consult with an attorney during an event that lead to a license revocation was not a constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified question was whether a defendant's constitutional right to due process and a fair trial were violated when the defendant refused to submit to a police-administered blood-alcohol-level test and instead requested an independent test but was denied the opportunity to obtain the independent test. The court of appeals found that law-enforcement authorities did not violate Minnesota law or otherwise intentionally or willfully prevent the defendant from obtaining an independent blood-alcohol test. The authorities properly applied the plain language of the implied-consent statute. The defendant decided not to satisfy the condition precedent to independent testing and thus chose not to trigger his right to an additional test. There was nothing in the record to show or to intimate that law-enforcement authorities willfully or inadvertently, by words, acts, or omissions, interfered with the defendant's ability to satisfy the statutory condition precedent. Therefore, the defendant's due process rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued, inter alia, that he was unlawfully seized after a property damage accident when the police asked him to leave his vehicle, subjected him to a breath test, and subsequently arrested him. The court of appeals disagreed. After receiving a report of a property damage accident, police officers observed a vehicle in the immediate area moving erratically at a high rate of speed. When police stopped the car, they found the defendant in a passenger seat. Investigation at the accident scene revealed that another party had given the defendant permission to drive the car suspected in the property damage accident. The defendant displayed indicia of intoxication, and after checking his driver's license the police officers found that it had been revoked. Under those circumstances, the officers had more than the required articulable suspicion to justify the defendant's seizure. The subsequent administration of a preliminary breath test and the defendant's admission that he had consumed alcoholic beverages were sufficient to constitute probable cause for his arrest.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that the evidence supported defendant's adjudication of second-degree assault, but his conduct did not constitute tampering with a vehicle, and his language did not amount to fighting words. First, the trial court could have reasonably found that the State disproved at least two of the elements of self-defense, belief of imminent danger and exhaustion of opportunities to retreat, beyond a reasonable doubt. Secondly, defendant's conduct of looking inside the vehicle with a flashlight and pulling on the vehicle door handle did not constitute tampering with a vehicle under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.546(2) (2000), as he neither changed or altered the vehicle, nor substantially interfered with it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court considered the defendant's 1978 juvenile murder conviction in its sentencing calculation. The defendant argued that the trial court erred by counting a Texas murder conviction as an adult conviction for sentencing purposes. The court of appeals disagreed. Applying current Minnesota law to out-of-state conviction was consistent with the policy that all defendants prosecuted in Minnesota had their criminal history scores computed similarly. Moreover, as the sentencing guidelines provision cited in the defendant's first appeal made clear, prior Minnesota convictions were weighed according to current severity levels. Because the supreme court considered the fairness of its decision to different groups of defendants, the court of appeals could not second-guess that decision. Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped due to his erratic driving. The police officer noticed the smell of alcohol on defendant's breath and a breath test showed an alcohol concentration of 0.043. Defendant initially stated he had consumed about &quot;an inch of beer&quot; at the American Legion post and then amended his story to indicate that he had had a beer at home before going to the post. Defendant later testified that he had only drank non-alcoholic beer. Defendant challenged the results of the breath test at the district court hearing but did not argue the constitutionality of Minn. R. 7503.1300, subp. 3 (1999). In a letter brief to the district court two weeks after the hearing, defendant first raised the issue that the construction of Rule 7503.1300, subp. 3, to include the consumption of &quot;nonalcoholic&quot; beer was unconstitutionally overbroad and went beyond the scope of the commissioner's authority because it regulated permissible conduct. The appellate court refused to consider defendant's as the issue was not raised at the district court hearing.

After several appeals, the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota) vacated the injunction on the ground it violated the U.S. Const. amend. I protection against prior restraint of speech. The appellant challenged the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the appellant challenged the district court's vacating the temporary injunction, arguing that the district court exceeded its authority under Minn. R. Civ. P. 62.02 and abused its discretion by vacating the injunction in the absence of changed circumstances. The appellant also argued that the injunction did not violate the U.S. Const. amend. I, as the prohibited statements were found to be defamatory by a court of competent jurisdiction. The appellate court found that the district court exceeded its authority to modify the injunction under Rule 62.02 and instead made a ruling akin to a reversal on a motion for reconsideration. Therefore, the ruling was in error. The court also found that the injunction was overbroad, because it enjoined the respondent from making certain statements regardless of the context. Because portions of the injunction were not limited to the precise statements found by the Alabama court to be defamatory, it violated the &quot;prior restraint&quot; doctrine. The court reversed the vacation and remanded to narrow the scope of the injunction so that it restricted only those statements found to be defamatory and did not extend to non-defamatory speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by adding a five year period of conditional release to his sentence because it violated his right to be free from double jeopardy. The court of appeals disagreed. The corrections department contacted the trial court in 1999 to ascertain whether a term of conditional release was included in the defendant's sentence. Because no conditional-release term was included in the original sentence, the trial court ordered the commissioner of corrections to place the defendant on conditional release for five years after he completed his term of imprisonment. Such action was proper and did not violate the federal or state constitutions. Therefore, the trial court did not err by adding the five year period of conditional release to the defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

The Marshall County District Court (Minnesota) denied the petition. The property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the petition, as it concluded that the property owners had adequate legal remedies. On appeal, the property owners argued that: (1) the trial court erred when it determined that there were alternative legal remedies available to them; and (2) the failure to enforce the repair order resulted in an unconstitutional taking of their property without just compensation. The appellate court rejected the property owners' contentions. The court held, based on another case decision, that the watershed district had no authority to assess the cost of repairs on state property benefited by the ditch, therefore the watershed district had no clear duty to assess repair costs pro rata. Therefore the watershed district could not enforce the repair order, and the property owners were not entitled to mandamus relief. The court also held that the failure to enforce the repair order did not constitute a deprivation of property rights, because the watershed district still had a duty to maintain the ditch.</SPAN></P>

Appellant State sought review, arguing that the district court erred, as the traffic stop was supported by a reasonable suspicion that respondent's license tabs were stolen or mismatched with the wrong vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State also argued that, as the trooper was unable to access current registration information because certain state offices were closed, it was reasonable to stop the driver and question her about the apparent registration discrepancy. The appellate court disagreed, noting that investigatory stops to check a driver's license or a vehicle's registration, if not supported by reasonable, articulable suspicion, were unconstitutional. Although the factual basis required to support a stop for a &quot;routine traffic check&quot; was minimal, an officer had to have something more than an unarticulated &quot;hunch&quot; to support an investigatory stop. Here, the driver was operating her vehicle legally, with current license tabs. It was undisputed that she was not violating the state law that mandated vehicles be re-registered annually. The trooper, however, notwithstanding the driver's apparently legal motor-vehicle operation, instead relied on the mobile data terminal's admittedly unreliable information and his &quot;hunches&quot; to support an inference that the tabs were stolen or mismatched. Thus, the mere registration discrepancy did not support reasonable suspicion to initiate the investigatory stop.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim testified that defendant forced her into a vehicle, showed her a loaded gun, and placed the gun on the dashboard while he was driving. In the execution of a search warrant following defendant's arrest, a loaded gun was found under the driver's seat of his vehicle. At sentencing, the trial court found by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant possessed a firearm during the commission of the kidnapping, and that sentencing under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11 (2000) was therefore appropriate. The appellate court ruled that the facts, along with the specific counts with which defendant was charged, were sufficient to notify him of the nature and cause of the accusations against him, and he received adequate notice of the applicability of the statute. Furthermore, the acquittal on firearm offenses did not preclude a finding that he used or possessed a firearm during the commission of other offenses. The aggravating factors of the invasion of the victim's zone of privacy, the particular cruel treatment, the lack of remorse, and the appearance to not fully appreciate the seriousness of his actions supported the two-thirds durational departure imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court correctly suppressed the evidence because the arresting officer did not have his peace officer's license at the time of the arrest. The court of appeals disagreed. A private citizen may arrest another person for an offense committed or attempted in the arresting person's presence. After stopping the defendant for running a stop sign, the officer observed multiple indicators of intoxication, including a strong odor of alcohol, slurred speech, confusion, and difficulty maintaining balance. Those indicators provided the officer with probable cause to arrest the defendant for DWI. Thus, because the initial stop was lawful and the officer's observations provided him with probable cause to arrest for DWI, the arrest for DWI was also lawful. Therefore, the trial court erred by suppressing the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The Winona County, Minnesota, District Court determined that his crime was a severity level VIII offense, sentenced him to an upward departure sentence, and ordered him to pay a $ 100,000 fine and to reimburse a drug task force for costs of prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing an upward durational sentence, by ordering him to reimburse the task force, and by imposing a constitutionally excessive fine. The appellate court found that defendant was involved in an enterprise whose purpose was to distribute crack cocaine for profit. His offense was aggravated by his long-term involvement, large circle of associates, importation from out-of-state, and distribution in his hometown. His business disregarded the safety and welfare of his sellers and buyers, and the community as a whole. In short, his offense was grave, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing an upward durational departure from the presumptive sentence. It held that the fine imposed was not disproportional to the gravity of his offense or to fines imposed in the same and other jurisdictions for other crimes, and thus did not violate defendant's constitutional rights. Finally it held that the trial court's characterization of the payment to drug task force as restitution was an inadvertent, technical error; the payment was to reimburse costs of prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the sentence and the fines imposed, and the repayment of costs of prosecution ordered by the district court.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that: (1) the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to protect jurors from harassment by parties or attorneys despite the completion of the criminal case; (2) the district court retained jurisdiction to hear the motion despite a pending appeal because the motion was collateral; (3) the long-arm statute conferred personal jurisdiction over defendant's mother; (4) the State had standing to bring the motion; (5) due process was not violated because the district court provided defendant with a fair opportunity to defend his actions; (6) harassment of the jurors was clearly prohibited; and (7) defendant's other contentions were not meritorious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over the years, the culvert in the ditch had risen to a higher elevation as a result of natural forces, and the landowners wanted it to be lowered to the height of the original placement, and the sediment in the ditch removed. The landowners obtained proof from the Army Corps of Engineers that the ditch work met the requirements of the federal exemption. But, applying the state rule that limited the exemption, the board denied the exemption. The landowners contended that the board exceeded its statutory authority in adopting Minn.

The court of appeals held that: (1) defendant had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the storage unit that would require police to obtain a warrant or show an exception to the warrant requirement before opening and entering the unit; (2) because the officer's belief that the storage facility manager had the authority to consent to a search of defendant's storage unit was a reasonable, but factually erroneous, belief based on the facts presented to him, and not a misapprehension of the applicable rule of law, the search was valid under the Rodriguez doctrine of apparent authority; (3) the exigent circumstances exception did not authorize the initial opening of the storage unit door, and could not justify any evidence discovered as a result of opening the door; and (4) the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply here, because the state did not show that the police would have obtained the evidence had no misconduct taken place.</SPAN></P>

The defendant's issue on appeal was previously raised and decided in a prior case before the appellate court, however, the defendant argued for reconsideration of the issue. The appellate court found that the defendant advanced no argument for reconsideration of the prior decision that was based on a consideration unanticipated by the prior case analysis or that was based on a change in statutory law or constitutional interpretation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate challenged his commitment on the ground that Minn.

The inmate alleged that the statute: (1) violated substantive due process because it allowed access to records without a preliminary showing that the person was subject to commitment; (2) violated the separation of powers clause; and (3) had to be construed to require that the commitment petition be filed and that any requested records be provided first to the court and to the individual before the county attorney. The court of appeals held that: (1) the inmate lacked standing to assert the right of third persons not before the court of appeals, and that the inmate could only challenge the statute as it applied to him; (2) the statute, as applied to the inmate, was constitutional; (3) the inmate waived his separation-of-powers challenge; (4) it would not impose the D.M.C. factors on Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.185, subd. 1b; and (5) it would not address the argument that the importance of the doctor-patient privilege outweighed the policy for releasing records based merely on a showing that the category of records might be relevant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and was charged with gross misdemeanor DWI based on the results his breath test and on a prior DWI conviction. The Mille Lacs County District Court (Minnesota) set bail at $ 12,000, or, in the alternative, at $ 6,000, in the event that appellant submitted to electronic alcohol monitoring. Defendant, who posted a $ 12,000 bail bond, filed an appeal from the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that the DWI bail statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.44, which mandated conditions of pretrial release for DWI defendants, conflicted with Minn. R. Crim. P. 6.02, subd. 1, the rule governing pretrial release, and therefore violated the constitutional provision for separation of judicial and legislative powers. The DWI bail statute applied to certain defendants charged with having an alcohol concentration of more than .20. The appellate court noted that in matters of procedure rather than substance, the criminal rules took precedence over any statute to the contrary. The DWI bail statute did not create a criminal offense or define the punishment for it, but it did regulate a DWI defendant's right to bail, which was a constitutional right. As a result, the matter of conditions of pretrial release was not strictly procedural. Thus, defendant did not meet his burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that bail was a strictly procedural matter in which the rule must have taken precedence over the statute. Finally, the matter was not moot, as the appellate court's ruling affected whether defendant's bail would be returned.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 298.75 (Supp. 1997). The aggregate company filed suit against the township challenging the board's authority to implement the tax. The St. Louis County District Court (Minnesota) determined that the board had the authority to adopt and implement the aggregate tax. The aggregate company sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Designated counties and townships in Minnesota were authorized to impose a tax on the removal of aggregate material under Minn. Stat. &sect; 298.75 (2000). The issue on appeal was whether the town board or town electors constituted the governing body of the town for purposes implementing the aggregate tax statute. While there was no specific reservation of the power of taxation to either the board or the electors with regard to the aggregate tax, the appellate court concluded that the town board had the authority to implement the tax under the aggregate tax statutory scheme. First, the board had broad authority over duties not committed to other units of government, and there was no express legislative requirement that the electors authorize or ratify the board's decisions to implement or adopt the aggregate tax. Second, the board had statutory authority to levy other taxes for the town. Third, the electors took no action to repudiate the board's action or to initiate its own. Finally, the appellate court held that the legislature had a rational basis for the special legislation and rejected the aggregate company's argument that it was unfairly burdened by the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative father cohabitated with the birth mother in Iowa for a short period of time during her pregnancy, before she moved to a home for pregnant teens in Minnesota without telling him. When she gave birth to the child, she did not list the father on the birth certificate, and put the child up for adoption. Thirty one days after the birth, the father learned of the birth and sent the appropriate forms to the Minnesota adoption registry. The district court concluded that the father was not subsequently entitled to notice of the adoption hearing because his registration with the adoption registry was untimely. The appellate court agreed. The father was not entitled to notice of the adoption by reason of his brief cohabitation with the mother during her pregnancy. The birth mother had no duty to disclose her adoption plans, her whereabouts, or the place or date of the child's birth to the putative father, so his claim that her fraudulent concealment tolled the running of the period for registration failed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the sentence imposed by the Clay County District Court, Minnesota. On remand, defendant was sentenced to a triple upward durational departure from the presumptive sentence based upon severe aggravating circumstances. Defendant was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.342, subd. 1(h)(iii) (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant began sexually abusing his stepdaughter when she was approximately 11 years old and it continued until she was approximately 15 years old, the abuse took place at home and on long road trips. Defendant essentially imprisoned his stepdaughter when he forced her to accompany him on over-the-road semi-trailer trips where she had no way to flee or get help and when he handcuffed her. The appellate court found that: (1) the sentencing court's triple upward departure relied on factors that were already part of the elements of the offense and thus could not be used as the basis for a sentencing departure; (2) it could not affirm the sentencing court's triple durational departure because, based on the facts of this case, the sentence was totally disproportionate; and (3) defendant's use of handcuffs and imprisonment on the victim was sufficient to support a double upward departure from the presumptive sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentencing court's decision to depart upwardly was affirmed, but defendant's sentence was modified to 172 months, a double upward departure from the presumptive sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kandiyohi County District Court (Minnesota) denied defendant's request for disclosure of an informant's identity but granted his motion to limit testimony about the informant to the fact that a tip was received, and to exclude testimony about the contents of the tip. The district court granted the state's motion to qualify an officer as an expert witness. Defendant was convicted of a first degree controlled substance crime. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, without objection, the content of the tip was disclosed to the jury, witnesses made two references to defendant's having exercised his right to remain silent, and the district court gave a permissive-inference jury instruction. The appellate court held: (1) admission of the contents of the tip was error, but defendant waived the right to appeal and the tip's content, used to explain the initial stop, did not affect the trial's outcome; (2) because an officer received information that defendant planned to physically harm the informant, the district court did not err by failing to require disclosure of the informant's identity; (3) the officer's expert testimony was admissible as evidence of the intent to sell drugs; (4) although the two statements about defendant remaining silent were erroneously admitted, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because they were admitted to explain police conduct and were not directed against defendant; and (5) the jury instruction, which complied with the law, was not a mandatory inference so it did not violate defendant's due process rights. The parties agreed that defendant's sentence was incorrectly calculated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent town levied special assessments against appellant homeowners. The Scott County District Court (Minnesota) found that the hook-up fees should not be part of the assessment amounts under Minn. Stat. &sect; 444.075, subd. 3 (2000). The homeowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners claimed the assessment was unconstitutional, and exceeded the benefits of the improvements. While Minn. Stat. &sect; 444.075, subd. 3 (2000) treated the assessment and hook-up fees separately, the statute did not mandate that the hook-up fees could not be considered in analyzing the benefit to the property. The district court's decision not to include the fees in the assessment was an error. The district court's decision to adopt appraisals that used an earlier location adjustment was within its range of discretion. The district court erred in increasing the value of the special benefit to the homeowners' properties on the assumption that they had failing septic systems. The town used an illegal method to allocate the special assessment by adding the cost of the temporary easements over their properties rather than to all the properties affected by the improvements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed those parts of the trial court's decision in which it did not include the hook-up fees in the assessment, and in adding $ 3,500 to the homeowners' properties. The court also reversed and remanded to establish on the record the special benefit of the easements to the parties' properties. The decision to adopt appraisals using an earlier location adjustment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued, inter alia, that: (1) Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 7a(b) (2000) unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof from the State to him; and (2) the State failed to present clear and convincing evidence that he was dangerous to other persons within the meaning of Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18b (2000). The court of appeals held that: (1) a presumption imposed on the defendant the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption, but did not shift the burden of proof, the statute allowed the State to establish the element of likelihood of harm to others through proof that the defendant committed criminal sexual conduct in the first to fourth degrees, and at all times the burden of proof remained with the state; and (2) the defendant's sexual assaults involved repeated oral and anal sex with children as young as five years old and were accompanied by threats of violence, the character and nature of the defendant's assaults alone justified a finding that he was substantially likely to cause serious physical and emotional harm and was, therefore, dangerous to others within the meaning of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the prisoner contended that because he was denied effective assistance of counsel, the trial court abused its discretion in denying his petition for postconviction relief. The prisoner argued that his attorney was ineffective because he was unaware of a case pending before the Minnesota Supreme Court that could have affected the outcome of his case. The prisoner also argued that his guilty pleas were unintelligent because he was unaware of the pending case. The appellate court held that the trial court correctly determined that the prisoner had effective assistance of counsel and was not entitled to withdraw his guilty pleas and affirmed. While the pending case may have been helpful to the prisoner, his attorney's failure to advise him of the case at the time the prisoner pled guilty did not cause his performance to fall below an objective standard of reasonableness. Attorneys are not required to inform their clients of all possible indirect consequences and know of every significant case pending in the appellate courts. Additionally, the lack of information about the pending case was not grounds for withdrawal of the prisoner's guilty pleas.</SPAN></P>

Upon entering the house with defendant's consent, the officers told him that if he turned over the paraphernalia, they would not charge him with possessing it. Defendant agreed, and consented to a search of the home. An officer then saw a shotgun on the floor of the bedroom in plain view. Defendant had been adjudicated delinquent for felony auto theft four years earlier, when he was seventeen years old. Defendant argued that the statute he was convicted under was unconstitutional, violated his right to procedural due process because it did not provide notice that it was illegal for persons convicted of certain crimes to possess firearms, and violated his procedural due process, as the statute was not sufficiently clear and failed to include a mens rea element. The court ruled that defendant's prior adjudication itself put him on notice that he was ineligible to possess a firearm, and he failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute violated his right to substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the defendant challenged the constitutionality of the police investigatory stop that resulted in the seizure of the firearm. The appellate court found that the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion to exclude the gun from evidence. The court found that the police had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the defendant was engaged in illegal conduct, and therefore the investigatory stop was constitutional. The trial court found, that in addition to the defendant's presence in a high drug-trafficking area, several other facts were significant in determining whether police had a reasonable, articulable suspicion of illegal activity. The defendant's actions in flagging down a car at 10:40 p.m., and leaning into the car to talk to the occupants, paralleled illegal drug dealing. Additionally, the defendant's conduct after noticing the police, where he jerked back from the car and grabbed into his waistband, were more than sufficient to constitute a reasonable, articulable suspicion for stopping the defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's expectation of privacy in the fish house was reasonable. Defendant's ice fishing was not a business activity, and the exception to the warrant requirement for administrative inspections of commercial premises in a pervasively regulated industry did not apply to a search of private property used for a personal recreational activity.

The court of appeals held that: (1) the district court had not erred because the defendant shouted and cursed at the deputies as they were attempting to conduct preliminary breath tests and cite underage, intoxicated partygoers, following deputies in and out of a barn; therefore, there was a basis for the jury to reasonably conclude that the defendant's oral conduct physically obstructed the deputies' ability to perform their official duties; and (2) the evidence was sufficient because a deputy testified that as he was trying to re-enter the barn to assist the other deputies the defendant stood in the doorway to keep him from entering, and the defendant put his hand up and began yelling that the deputy had to leave.

The appellate court held that the district court did not err in finding that a medical laboratory assistant was a person qualified to draw blood under &sect; 169.123, subd. 3 because: (1) there was no difference in the training required for a laboratory assistant and a medical laboratory assistant; and (2) the national certification for a laboratory assistant required the same training as the Minnesota certification for a medical laboratory assistant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, which convicted him of possession of a firearm by an ineligible person in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 624.713, subds. 1(b), 2, 609.11, subd. 5(b) (1998).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim reported that a crime had been committed, and gave the officers an address where they could find the defendant. They arrived at the address at 4:30 a.m., and the only person they encountered was defendant, who was standing directly in front of the address. Defendant fit the description of the suspect. When asked for identification defendant attempted to escape. The parties stipulated that defendant had been convicted of a crime that made him ineligible to possess a firearm and that his felon status would not be mentioned to the jury. When the trial court started its instructions it almost told the jury that defendant was a felon, but it ended up telling the jury that the parties had stipulated that the defendant was ineligible to possess a firearm. The appellate court found that: (1) the motion to suppress evidence was properly denied because the stop and seizure was supported by specific, articulable facts that created reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed; and (2) the slight misstatement in the initial jury instructions, within the course of a daylong trial and two sets of jury instructions, did not rise to the level of prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that: (1) defendant's sentence under the patterned sex offender statute did not violate his due-process rights because his prison term did not exceed the statutory maximum allowed for second-degree criminal sexual conduct; (2) the sentencing court did not err when it considered his prior uncharged offenses, and the mental health professional had the requisite qualifications to give the sentencing court a professional assessment; and (3) severe aggravating factors were not required to justify a greater than double departure from the presumptive sentence when the sentencing court was using the patterned sex offender statute.</SPAN></P>

The convictions did not require conflicting findings on a necessary element of each offense. The State did not need to prove that defendant intended to sell cocaine, only that he offered to sell it. There was nothing in that requirement of an offer to sell that was inconsistent with an intent to swindle.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State and commissioner challenged the district court's jurisdiction to consider refunds for the net operating loss carryback or carryover tax years because the bank failed to perfect its claims for refunds for those years within the time limitations imposed by the tax-refund statute. The appellate court held that the allegations of the bank's complaint could not overcome its failure to file timely claims for refund for the carryback and carryover tax years. The bank argued that its action could proceed on the alternative theory of unjust enrichment. The appellate court determined that the tax refund statute provided the exclusive remedy for the recovery of unconstitutionally discriminatory corporate excise taxes, and that its time limitations could not be avoided by an action for unjust enrichment. The bank also argued that it had a valid cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty and that such an action was not subject to the periods of limitation under the tax-refund statute. The appellate court rejected the bank's argument because immunity protected the State and its employees from any tort liability, and the tax-refund statute provided the exclusive remedy.</SPAN></P>

The legislature based its decision to treat street gang members differently from non-gang members on more than anecdotal evidence. The court deferred to that finding. Defendant failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the gang statute violated equal protection guarantees. Section 609.229 showed a substantial and distinct reason for creating a harsher penalty for crimes committed by gang members. Section 609.229 did not violate the equal protection clause of Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for possession of controlled substances after a stop for having loud music in his car. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence on the basis that the extended detention of his car after the initial stop was not based on reasonable suspicion. The Winona County District Court (Minnesota) granted the suppression motion and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the extended stop was constitutional because it was based on a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity, specifically: (1) defendant drove for two blocks before stopping, even though he had earlier opportunities to pull over; (2) two persons in the car were known drug dealers; (3) defendant had a reputation of being a possible narcotics dealer; (4) defendant became nervous after the officer asked to search the car; and (5) defendant began sweating and stuttering when the officer told him that there was a drug-sniffing dog in the squad car. The court of appeals held that the stop was unconstitutional because the officer's detention of defendant continued beyond the time necessary for him to cite defendant for a noise violation or to give him a warning, and because the investigatory aspects of the stop were based more on a whim and a hunch than on a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity. Therefore, the district court did not err in suppressing the evidence discovered as a result of the detention.</SPAN></P>

The child support magistrate raised the father's child support and medical support. The father appealed, and the Stearns County District Court, Minnesota, remanded the matter to the magistrate with instructions to make additional findings. The magistrate made further findings, and the father sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father had three children by his second marriage. The father failed to report that his income had increased. The magistrate found that the father had medical insurance covering only himself, and that the mother paid $ 261 per month for medical and dental insurance for herself and two children, only one of whom was the father's child. The magistrate ordered the father to pay $ 150 per month for medical support, and $ 400 a month for child support which deviated downward from the guidelines. The appellate court found that: (1) the evidence supported the magistrate's conclusion deviating downward from the guidelines, (2) the magistrate abused her discretion on medical support because she made no findings as to whether the father had insurance coverage or what part of the mother's insurance cost was attributed to their one child, (3) the father was not denied his right to seek review of the magistrate's decision, (4) the county attorney properly represented its own public interest, and (5) the father failed to show that similarly situated persons were treated differently, therefore he was not denied equal protection under the Minnesota's child support statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the magistrate to make findings on what portion of the insurance cost was attributable to the father's child, and what amount the father should be required to pay toward unreimbursed medical expenses.

However, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the &sect; 385.160(b) charge brought against exotic dancer. Section 385.160(b) implicated constitutional free speech protections because certain forms of sexual conduct were sufficiently expressive to be considered speech. Because &sect; 385.160(b) did not define the &quot;other sexual conduct&quot; that was prohibited therein, the section of the ordinance regulating such conduct was unconstitutionally overbroad. Also, city had to prove that conduct was legally obscene in order to establish that the conduct was lewd and lascivious in violation of &sect; 385.160(a), (c).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the sentencing court erred in construing his motion to correct his sentence as a postconviction petition and in refusing to appoint counsel for him. Appellant also argued that the sentencing court erred in granting the State's motion for a double upward departure from the presumptive sentence without a jury determination on the reasons for departure. The instant court concluded that the sentencing court did not err in construing appellant's motion as one for postconviction relief. Appellant's sentence of 360 months was within the statutory maximum. Additionally, the sentencing court could have used the sole factor of appellant's prior felony conviction to support a double departure. Thus, appellant's sentence was not unconstitutional. The public defender properly declined to represent appellant because appellant had already received assistance from the public defender for his direct appeal.

The court held that when the officer observed an object suspended from the driver's rear vision mirror, in violation of Minn.

The court found that the statute's plain meaning was unambiguous and prohibited suspending any object whatsoever, without regard to whether it obstructed the driver's vision.

The district court determined that the six-year statute of limitations on appellants' claims of unconstitutional impairment of contract, denial of equal protection, common law breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment had begun to run as of the effective date of 1989 statutory amendments, which substantially changed or modified appellants' pension plans, not on the dates when appellants retired and began to collect their pensions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged an annexation proceeding. The ALJ had the authority to consider the annexation and incorporation petitions. The lack of a written plan for future services did not preclude annexation.  Minn. Stat. &sect; 40A.121, subd. 3 provided an exception allowing the annexation of agricultural property. Substantial evidence supported the ALJ's decision to order annexation. Appellants did not have a constitutional right to vote to either affirm, or disaffirm, an order for annexation. Appellants were not deprived of their constitutional right to elect a representative city council. The fact that township residents could have only appeared on the ballots only as write-in candidates did not deprive appellants of their ability to reasonably vote for a particular candidate and to cast their votes effectively. There was ample evidence demonstrating the benefits of annexation, and the taxes bore a reasonable relationship to services.</SPAN></P>

Decision to annex was authorized by law, was supported by substantial evidence, and did not violate appellants' constitutional rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators appealed from a decision of the Lake of the Woods County Commission (Minnesota), requiring contribution for installation of a statutory fence in a framed cervidae operation. Relators alleged that applying Minn. Stat. ch. 344, the fence viewer statute, violated their constitutional rights by depriving them of due process of law and just compensation for taken property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent owned land for a farmed cervidae operation. In a petition to the county commission for a fence viewing, respondent requested cost sharing for a fence surrounding his property. When fence viewers granted respondent's request for contribution toward the cost of fence construction, relators challenged their decision. On certiorari review, the court's inquiry was limited. Although relators argued that their use and enjoyment of their land would be diminished by constructing the partition fence, nothing in the record showed that they would be deprived of all reasonable uses of their land; thus, they failed to establish that there was an unconstitutional taking. The state fence partition law was constitutional. Relators had to make substantial expenditures to comply with the statute, however, that did not render it unconstitutional. Relators' property would benefit from the fence by providing freedom from intrusion by neighboring livestock and increased privacy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners appealed from a district court judgment affirming a decision of respondent joint drainage authority that their land parcels received an economic benefit from Joint County Ditch No. 9. Appellants contended that the evidence demonstrated their properties were too high and distant from the ditch to benefit from it and that they were being taxed for the exercise of their common-law right to use their land. The appellate court affirmed. Appellants cited witnesses whose testimony supported their contention that they did not benefit from the ditch. Testimony also criticized the viewers' methods of determining the benefits. Nonetheless, the district court's findings were based on its assessment of the conflicting testimony. They were supported by the record and were not clearly erroneous.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband opposed petitioner wife's attempts to dissolve their marriage.

The appellate court disagreed. The dissolution statutes did not allow &quot;divorce on demand&quot; because the statutes required proof of &quot;no reasonable prospect of reconciliation.&quot; Appellant's withdrawal from the courtroom meant that he neither entered evidence contrary to petitioner's assertions, nor cross-examined her regarding the state of the marriage; thus, the only evidence presented was petitioner's uncontradicted testimony that the marriage was irretrievably broken.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a series of alcohol-related driving incidents, Appellant's driver's license was cancelled. Appellant's driving privileges were later reinstated, conditioned on appellant's total abstinence from alcohol. A police officer, after a short investigation, determined that appellant had consumed alcohol and appellant's license was cancelled. The district court sustained the cancellation and denial of appellant's driving privileges. On appeal, the appellant contended that the officer illegally seized him and that evidence should have been excluded. The appellate court disagreed. Although the district court found that the seizure of evidence was unconstitutional, the exclusionary rule did not preclude respondent from considering the evidence in an administrative hearing. Appellant signed a form acknowledging that his driving privileges were conditioned on his complete abstinence from alcohol and drugs and that failure to abstain would result in the immediate and mandatory cancellation of driving privileges.

The instant court rejected relator's contention that because the phrase &quot;good cause&quot; was not defined the ordinance authorizing the city council to revoke licenses was unconstitutional. Although relator itself was not found to have violated any laws, illegal activity that arguably posed a threat to public safety occurred on its premises. The &quot;good cause&quot; standard was definite enough so that relator knew it was subject to adverse action. However, the instant court stated it could not determine with certainty whether the evidence supported the city council's decision. In transferring the case to the district court, the instant court noted that relator presented extensive documentation of alleged irregularities in procedures. It was impossible for the instant court to untangle the improper influences from the council's final decision and determine whether the evidence in the record supported the council's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the imposition of a 10 percent cost-of-confinement surcharge on money sent as gifts to adult inmates. The court of appeals affirmed the ruling granting summary judgment for appellees. Once a non-inmate appellant sent money to the DOC for an inmate, the gift was delivered and the donor relinquished all control over the money. The non-inmate appellants made an absolute disposition of their gifts once they sent the money to DOC. The non-inmate appellants did not suffer an actual injury and did not have standing to challenge the cost-of-confinement policy. DOC had statutory authority to create the debt for costs of confinement and to make deductions from non-wage funds to satisfy the debt. The cost-of-confinement policy fell within the exemptions to the definition of &quot;rule&quot; and DOC was not required to engage in formal rulemaking procedure to promulgate the policy. The district court did not err in finding that the cost-of-confinement policy did not violate appellants' due-process rights. The district court did not err in finding that the cost-of-confinement policy did not constitute an unconstitutional governmental taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over several years, appellant committed numerous criminal sexual acts and was incarcerated. He refused most offers of sex-offender treatment and never completed any treatment that he started. The State petitioned to commit appellant as a sexual psychopathic personality (SPP) and sexually dangerous person (SDP). After evaluation, two experts testified that appellant met the standards for commitment as an SPP and SDP. When appellant's commitment was made indeterminate, he appealed. The appellate court confirmed the commitment. The district court had considered appropriate factors in deciding that appellant exhibited a predatory sexual impulse and the lack of power to control it. The severity and frequency of appellant's violent sexual acts, coupled with expert testimony that appellant was highly likely to commit additional sex offenses, and appellant's refusal to complete sex-offender treatment, provided clear and convincing evidence that appellant was highly likely to reoffend. Therefore, appellant's commitment was proper.</SPAN></P>

Convictions were not in violation of double jeopardy, as the violations were part of a continuing offense. Issuance of a state used-car-dealer permit did not impermissibly conflict with the city ordinance. The state statute did not expressly allow appellant to leave abandoned and junk vehicles outside an enclosed building. The ordinance was enacted pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 168B.01.

The court found that the statute was a natural outgrowth of the Taconite Tax Relief Area (TTRA) under Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.134 (2000), the sharing of the taconite production tax revenue to finance the economic development efforts to produce growth in the commercial-industrial property tax base. While the municipalities within the TTRA did not derive similar benefits from social or economic integration, they all derived substantial benefits from the sharing of the taconite production tax, sufficient to justify the burdens imposed by &sect;&sect; 276A.01-09.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the officers who stopped him as he was walking in the street lacked a reasonable suspicion to support an investigative stop. The appellate court held that the rule that an officer may make a routine traffic stop where he had a valid objective basis for making the stop applied to a pedestrian stop. Thus, the officers were justified in stopping appellant because they directly observed illegal activity. Appellant also argued that the officer's frisk of him was not supported by a reasonable suspicion that he was armed and dangerous. The court found that sufficient evidence of a dangerous situation was presented to warrant a protective search because: (1) the officers testified that in their experience people often carry concealed weapons in their waistband or groin area, and the officers both observed appellant adjusting something in his groin area after he noticed their presence; (2) throughout his contact with the officers, appellant frequently put his hands in his pockets, made adjustments, and also at some point faced away from the officers while doing so; and (3) appellant was in a high-crime area late at night.</SPAN></P>

A hearing officer upheld the declaration, but overruled the contention the dog was a dangerous animal under a city ordinance because relator agreed to keep the dog muzzled when it was alone or off relator's property. Relator failed to abide by the restrictions and the dog was involved in several more biting incidents. Respondent issued an order for destruction of the dog as a dangerous animal under Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances &sect; 64.120 (2000) and relator appealed, arguing the actions of respondent in regulating and ultimately ordering the destruction of a dangerous animal were precluded by state statute. The court affirmed, holding the municipal ordinance relied upon by respondent for the destruction of dangerous animals was not in conflict with or preempted by state law, and relator's due-process rights were not violated where the record did not indicate respondent's decision was unreasonable or without evidentiary support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the district court's decision refusing to apply the exclusionary rule to a hearing regarding whether his license should be canceled because he was inimical to public safety. The district court concluded that the exclusionary rule did not apply in the hearing regarding whether appellant's license should be canceled. On appeal, the court affirmed. Whether the exclusionary rule was applicable in an inimical-to-public-safety hearing was a purely legal question, which the appellate court reviewed de novo. Under the general rule, where a licensee whose driver's license was conditional on total abstinence from alcohol was found to have consumed alcohol, the license was subject to cancellation on the grounds that the licensee was inimical to public safety even if the evidence of alcohol consumption would not be admissible in an implied consent proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There were conflicting child support orders alternating between increases and decreases with the key issue being whether respondent's decline in income resulted from voluntary underemployment. Appellants contended that the magistrate erred in (1) calculating respondent's average net monthly income, (2) concluding that respondent was &quot;not voluntarily underemployed,&quot; and (3) deviating downward from the child support guidelines. The appellate court found that there was insufficient information in the record to support the magistrate's calculation of respondent's income. Further, the appellate court found that respondent failed to meet the burden of proving that he was not voluntarily underemployed. In addition, the appellate court found that the magistrate failed to address the statutory factors listed in Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.551, subd. 5b(d), and the magistrate erred in deviating from the child support guidelines because he did not issue findings showing how any deviation specifically addressed the factors listed in Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants put up signs on their property advertising their bookstore, without obtaining a permit from respondent township. Respondent filed a complaint in 1997, seeking removal of the sign. In related proceedings, a federal court found the ordinance constitutional, and respondent then resumed its action in state court. The trial court ordered appellants to remove the signs on a summary judgment motion. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that (1) with no material factual disputes, there was no requirement for findings of fact in a summary judgment motion; (2) appellant had adequate notice that all of its signs violated the ordinance, not just the one in place in 1997, and therefore the issue was not moot; (3) res judicata did not apply because the federal and state claims did not involve the same causes of action; and (4) laches did not apply, as the delay in the case was due to the federal action brought by appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator filed petitioned for a writ of certiorari to challenge a decision to terminate relator's Section VIII housing rental assistance. The decision was based on information indicating that relator had failed to report income of another adult living with her. Relator argued that the hearing officer failed to make explicit findings, including credibility determinations, and that the quality of hearsay evidence, against which she was not allowed to conduct cross-examination, did not constitute substantial evidence required to terminate her benefits. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that the findings of the hearing officer were sufficient to permit meaningful review, and there was substantial evidence supporting the decision to terminate benefits. The applicable federal regulations permitted hearsay evidence, in this case a police report indicating relator's admission to an officer that she had lived with the other adult for eight months. Second, respondent was not required under Goldberg v. Kelly to call witnesses to enable relator to cross-examine them.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he contended that he should have been granted a new trial based on improper jury instructions, improper use of a prior conviction, and prosecutorial misconduct. Appellant also alleged error in sentencing and ineffective assistance of counsel. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that (1) even if the jury instruction failed to properly instruct on the required intent, the jury understood that it should acquit appellant if it believed appellant had no intent to kill the victim; (2) appellant's prior assault conviction was within the 10-year time limit and had legitimate impeachment value; (3) the prosecutor's closing remarks did not reach a &quot;threshold of impropriety&quot; amounting to prosecutorial misconduct and did not constitute plain error; (4) there was no abuse of discretion in imposing the presumptive sentence rather than departing downward; (5) counsel's decisions were reasonable trial strategy; and (6) the all-white jury was not selected in an unconstitutional manner.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that an officer in hot pursuit of a person suspected of the serious offense of driving under the influence of alcohol could make a warrantless entry into the suspect's home in order to effectuate an arrest. Because the officers did not observe the offense, had not set an arrest in motion, and were not in hot pursuit of appellant, the warrantless entry of her home to effectuate a misdemeanor arrest was unlawful.

Appellant was sentenced by the court as a patterned sex offender and committed to the commissioner of corrections for 40 years. Appellant contended that Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While appellant was sitting in his new vehicle, the police arrived in response to a neighbor's complaint of noise. Appellant was arrested, and convicted, for driving while intoxicated. Because appellant had two prior impaired driving convictions or license revocations within five years of his arrest, his vehicle was seized pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.1217, subd. 2 (1998). Subsequently, the state began forfeiture proceedings, and appellant filed a civil complaint, claiming seizure of his vehicle violated double jeopardy and was an excessive fine. The appellate court affirmed judgment ordering forfeiture of the vehicle. As the forfeiture statute served an important, nonpunitive remedial goal of enhancing public safety, and appellant disregarded warnings from previous instances of intoxicated driving, the forfeiture was not punishment for double jeopardy purposes. Appellant's financial loss was a permissible punitive aspect of an otherwise civil and remedial statute. Forfeiture was not disproportionately harsh when compared with (1) the gravity of appellant's offense, (2) fines for other same-level offenses in Minnesota, and (3) penalties imposed in other jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment order forfeiture was affirmed. Forfeiture of appellant's new vehicle for DWI offense was not punishment for double jeopardy purposes. Financial loss was permissible punitive aspect of civil remedial statute. Forfeiture was not excessive fine because not disproportionately harsh.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because appellant's behavior was not the kind of behavior that was contemplated by the sexual-psychopathic personality statute, i.e., he had not physically injured his victims, he exhibited only sexual assaultive behavior, and the mental harm he inflicted was not greater than the mental harm likely to be caused by a sexual assault, his commitment as a sexual psychopathic personality was reversed. Because appellant had been convicted of three of the listed offenses that created a presumption that his conduct was harmful sexual conduct and he had not submitted evidence to rebut that presumption, his commitment as a sexually dangerous person was affirmed. Appellant had not met his burden of proving that a less-restrictive treatment program was available because he failed to provide any evidence that his proposed treatment alternatives were consistent with his treatment needs and the requirements of public safety. The trial court did not commit any prejudicial error in admitting police reports and psychological assessments, as those documents were admissible.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the state-administered blood-alcohol test should not have been admitted into evidence because a police officer: (1) unlawfully seized her without a reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity when placing her into the squad car, and (2) prevented her from taking an additional test by stating that the second test would &quot;take a long time&quot; and was &quot;not necessary.&quot; The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. A reasonable person in appellant's position would have felt free to leave. The officer did not execute a traffic stop, but instead approached appellant after seeing her vehicle stuck in a ditch. The interaction between the officer and appellant was nothing more than a police officer assisting a citizen in distress. Appellant was not frisked or placed in handcuffs. Appellant went to the squad car by invitation, not coercion. Thus, appellant was not subjected to an unconstitutional seizure. While the officer's statements to appellant were inappropriate, they did not actively mislead appellant or prevent her from taking a second test.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court upheld the termination order. Because any harm inflicted upon appellant by &sect; 260C.301, subd. 1(b)(4) was purely speculative, appellant could not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute violated her constitutional rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of conspiracy to commit the first-degree controlled substance crime of methamphetamine manufacture, contending that evidence should have been suppressed because police officers violated his U.S. Const. amend. IV rights by stopping his vehicle and conducting an illegal search, as well as arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The appellate court affirmed. The search was permissible pursuant to the inventory search of an impounded vehicle exception to the warrant requirement of U.S. Const. amend. IV. Because the vehicle had expired license plates and icy weather conditions existed at the time of the stop, police officers permissibly stopped and towed the vehicle. The subsequent search was permissibly conducted in accordance with police department procedures. The evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to reasonably infer that defendant had conspired to manufacture methamphetamine, since he and another had purchased methamphetamine ingredients in amounts consistent with manufacture and equipment and methamphetamine were found in the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court had properly ruled that while the presence of handcuffs and a police vehicle made the lineup overly suggestive, it did not taint the witness's identification because there was a three-man lineup from which the witness picked out the appellant. Further, the court found that the police made no attempt to influence the identification of the witness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the parties' divorce proceedings, by stipulation, the issue of child support was submitted to a child support magistrate. The magistrate issued a decision and petitioner sought review of that decision in the Stearns County District Court (Minnesota). The district court modified the magistrate's order, and respondent appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Disagreeing with the child support magistrate's calculation of petitioner's child support obligation, the district court modified the child support order, reducing petitioner's obligation. In doing so, the district court utilized the Hortis/Valento formula for determining the parties' child support obligations in joint physical custody cases. On appeal from that decision, respondent challenged the district court's (1) failure to give deference to the magistrate's findings, (2) determination that the parties had joint custody of their children, (3) failure to review a hearing transcript before issuing its findings, and (4) application of the Hortis/Valento formula. The court affirmed. The district court (1) did not owe any deference to the child support magistrate; (2) was not required to review a hearing transcript that neither party had ordered or provided to the court; (3) did not abuse its discretion when it concluded the parties had agreed to, and were awarded, joint physical custody; and (4) did not err in concluding that petitioner would have custody of the children 33 percent of the time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court order modifying the child support magistrate's order. De novo review of the magistrate's order was proper. The district court did not err in concluding that the parties' shared joint custody of their minor children. The Hortis/Valento formula was applicable to the parties' case and the district court applied it properly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was stopped in his car near a cemetery closed for the night, after the caretaker had called police reporting suspicious activity. Appellant was nervous and furtive while his license and title were being checked. He refused to allow a search of his car. When appellant stepped out of his car, he was seen stuffing a crack pipe into his pocket. The pipe was seized, and he was arrested. Cocaine and marijuana were found in the car after a canine search. Appellant's motion to suppress all evidence was denied, and he was convicted of controlled substance crime in the second degree. Appellant filed an appeal. The court that the police had articulable suspicion warranting their stop of appellant: they had received a call from the known caretaker of the cemetery and appellant was the only vehicle on the deserted, dead-end road to the cemetery. It also found that the duration of the stop was not unreasonable. The suspicion for the detention remained, and indeed ripened into probable cause to arrest appellant and search his person and car after the crack pipe was seized. Continuation of the detention to permit a canine &quot;sniff&quot; of the vehicle was warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of appellant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence, finding that there was nothing in the record to suggest that the police officers did anything to delay their efforts any longer than necessary to allay their reasonable, articulable suspicion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The paramount issue at trial was whether or not appellant was in possession of a firearm. The claimant's cousin was relevant only to the location of the cigarette box which contained some bullets on the day of appellant's arrest. This evidence was only a small piece of the State's substantial circumstantial case. The evidence against appellant was significant, if not overwhelming. The court concluded it was unnecessary to give a curative instruction, given that the name of the cousin was readily provided by claimant's mother. The court's decision not to give a curative instruction was a permissible exercise of discretion. The evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Because there was no reasonable probability of a more favorable verdict had appellant been in chambers for an in camera on-the-record discussion, any violation of his right to be present was harmless.</SPAN></P>

Because the squad cars were blocking his lane of traffic, and double yellow lines made passing in the westbound lane illegal, appellant stopped his vehicle. An officer then walked up to his vehicle, asked whether he needed assistance, and noticed indicia of intoxication. Appellant's driver's license was revoked pursuant to the implied consent law. Appellant contended that he was seized when he was unable to proceed in the eastbound lane because the squad cars, with warning lights activated, blocked his lane of travel, and he could not legally pass in the westbound lane of traffic. But the officers did not display any show of force, question, or otherwise engage in an encounter with appellant, instead, their display of force was directed toward another, unrelated vehicle. The police actions, which only incidentally stopped appellant's vehicle, did not constitute a seizure of appellant's vehicle. Thus, the revocation of appellant's driver's license was upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order from the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota) denying his petition for postconviction relief, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial because his attorney failed to challenge the constitutionality of the enhanced-gross-misdemeanor statute at trial and failed to object to the use of a six-person jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of enhanced gross misdemeanor test refusal in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.121, subds. 1a, 3(d)(2) (1998). Given the Minnesota Supreme Court's review of the validity of the gross-misdemeanor-test-refusal statute at the time of his trial, appellant argued that his attorney was negligent in failing to challenge its constitutionality. Even if other &quot;reasonable and experienced&quot; attorneys were regularly challenging the constitutionality of the statute, as appellant alleged, his attorney's failure to challenge the law did not rise to the level of negligence--defense counsel was trying the case in accordance with the law as it existed at that time. Furthermore, when the law did change, appellant's attorney immediately moved for resentencing, and appellant received a lesser sentence as a result. Appellant had not shown that a new trial before twelve jurors rather than six would have altered the final outcome. His conviction was based on his refusal to take a test measuring his blood-alcohol content, and the &quot;totality of the evidence&quot; before the jury suggested appellant would still have been found guilty of the charge and he was not deprived of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. In hindsight, appellant's attorney should have challenged the enhanced-gross-misdemeanor statute or objected to the six-person jury, but failure to do so was not unreasonable under the circumstances. Because the conduct of his attorney did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness, the postconviction court did not abuse its discretion in concluding the legal representation appellant received was not deficient.</SPAN></P>

Under Minn. Stat. &sect; 145.682 (1998), plaintiff's expert affidavits had to set forth the applicable standard of care, alleged acts that violated that standard of care, and a chain of causation the resulted in injury or death. Plaintiff's affidavits lacked the essential chain of causation between the violation of the applicable standard of care on defendants' part and the death of plaintiff's father.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father's minor was covered by a health insurance policy from respondent state-subsidized health insurer through respondent program, established by Minn. Stat. &sect; 256L.01-.18 (Supp. 1997). She sustained serious head injuries from a third party's car hitting her. Appellant as guardian sued the driver and submitted a claim to his insurer for underinsured motorist benefits. Appellant, the driver, and the insurer settled; he notified respondent insurer, petitioned for court-approval of the settlement, and respondent insurer filed a lien for the minor's incident-related medical care. Respondent insurer's motion to enforce was granted under Minn. Stat. &sect; 256L.03, subd. 6. The court affirmed. Minn. Stat. &sect; 62A.095, precluding health plans' subrogation/reimbursement rights before an injured had received full compensation for injuries, did not apply to respondent program which was a &quot;program&quot; rather than a &quot;health plan.&quot; The state did not become an insurer by virtue of its contracts with providers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kandiyohi County District Court certified two questions for appeal after upholding the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.229 (1998) and excluding expert opinion testimony about whether defendant was a gang member in his trial for attempted second-degree murder, drive by shooting, second-degree assault, unlawful possession of a firearm, and receiving stolen property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had certified two questions for appellate review. Because it was limited by a specific-intent requirement, the court concluded that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.229 (1998) did not reach so broadly as to burden innocent associations in violation of U.S. Const. amend. I. Because the statute did not delegate authority to local officials to approve of speech or conduct, it did not require loosening traditional standing requirements to prevent prior restraints. Thus, &sect; 609.229 was not substantially overbroad on its face. As to the second certified question, the court concluded that the record was not adequately developed for purposes of determining whether, as a matter of law, the gang-identification criteria were sufficiently reliable to form the basis of expert-opinion testimony; there was no transcript of the omnibus and motion hearing at which the admissibility of the police officer's expert opinion was argued and the trial court's factual findings were limited. Thus, the court could not answer the certified question regarding the reliability as a matter of law of the gang-identification criteria.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first certified question was answered in the negative because the trial court properly held that statute proscribing commission of a crime for benefit of a gang was not unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. The court could not answer the second certified question as the record was insufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based upon a citizen informant's complaint of two vehicles four-wheeling on private property, the deputy went to investigate possible criminal activity. Before trial, appellant moved to dismiss the charges for lack of a constitutional basis to support an investigative stop. The district court denied the motion, finding that the police acted reasonably in responding to the complaint. The district court then found appellant guilty of underage drinking and driving in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.1218 (1998), and not guilty of four-wheeling on private property under Minn. Stat. &sect; 84.90 (1998). The appellate court affirmed, holding that the possible violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 84.90, notwithstanding that appellant was ultimately acquitted of that charge, provided a sufficient individualized suspicion to justify the investigative stop. Furthermore, because the record was silent as to how long appellant was in handcuffs in the back of the squad car, the appellate court could not conclude that the length of the detention was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction was affirmed; because citizen informant's complaint regarding possible violation of statute prohibiting four-wheeling on private property was confirmed, police officer had a sufficient individualized suspicion to justify the investigative stop for possible criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

An inventory search of the car before it was towed turned up 109 grams of marijuana. Defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance. The district court dismissed the charge holding that the stop was pretextual because the officer could not remember what object was hanging from the mirror, did not issue a citation for the object, and the officer's assertion that the object would obstruct vision was less than credible. The State appealed from that dismissal. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the charge because the officer had no articulable suspicion of criminal activity prior to stopping the vehicle, and the district court did not err in determining that the stop was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Stearns County District Court (Minnesota) denying her motion to dismiss the citation that she failed to stop for a school bus, which was stopped with its stop signal arm extended and its lights flashing, on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutional, and finding her guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was driving in the left-hand northbound lane of a four-lane road divided only by double yellow lines. In the right-hand southbound lane, a school bus was stopped with its stop signal arm extended and its lights flashing. Appellant did not stop for the bus and was pulled over by a police officer. Appellant was convicted of violating Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.444 (1998). Appellant alleged that application of the statute deprived her of equal protection of the law and that the statute was void for vagueness. In considering the threat to children disembarking from the bus, the legislature could rationally place drivers on a separated roadway in a different classification than drivers who were not. Because appellant was not similarly situated to drivers meeting a school bus on a &quot;separated roadway,&quot; the district court did not err in rejecting appellant's argument that Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.444 deprived her of equal protection. Ordinary people would not understand the double yellow lines dividing a roadway to be any kind of island. Appellant could not show that the statute was vague. Thus, the statute was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with assaulting the victim in a restroom. Appellant claimed that his father committed the crime. Days after appellant was found guilty of assault, the State produced a police report, prepared during the investigation, but not previously disclosed to the defense. The report stated that appellant's father denied going to the restroom area, but saw appellant go into the restroom for a very short time. Appellant moved for a new trial in light of the State's failure to produce the report and in light of newly discovered evidence, which consisted of his father's admissions set forth in an affidavit attached to the motion. The trial court denied that motion. Appellant challenged the denial. On appeal, the court affirmed. The undisclosed report did not implicate appellant's father, but merely contained appellant's father's denial that he went into the restroom. The dispositive issue in the case concerned the identity of the victim's assailant, and the undisclosed evidence added nothing to that inquiry. Appellant's father's affidavit was not newly discovered evidence, as appellant's attorney had referred to appellant's father's admissions in her opening statement.</SPAN></P>

The court pointed out that an unlawful detainer proceeding was not the proper forum to challenge the contract for deed, and that the writ of restitution was supported by substantial evidence. The complaint alleged that appellants had been unlawfully occupying the property due to their failure to vacate after the cancellation of the contract for deed, and appellants admitted that they did nothing after receiving the notice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer heard a radio transmission that the registered owner of a vehicle with WX plates had warrants and his license was canceled for public safety.

The vehicle pulled into the garage and as the garage door began to close, the officer ran under the door. Appellant was convicted of aggravated driving while intoxicated in violation of Minn.

After a hearing, the district court committed him as an SDP, but dismissed the petition for commitment as a SPP. Appellant sought review, and the matter was remanded for determination of whether appellant met the standard for commitment as an SDP as clarified in Linehan. On remand the district court ruled on the existing record, without taking additional evidence, that appellant met the standard for commitment as an SDP as clarified in Linehan. Appellant sought review. Judgment was affirmed because the evidence and materials in the record supported the district court's determination, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a new hearing, and reexamination of the future harm issue was precluded on remand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a petition to adopt a young child. Respondent County Department of Children and Family Services moved the juvenile court to find that the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), 25 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1901-1963 (1994), was applicable to the adoption proceedings. The lower court properly determined that all further adoption proceedings were subject to the ICWA. It was clear that the adoptive placement proceedings were child-custody proceedings under the ICWA.

Stat. &sect; 13.01 et seq. (1998), by releasing her address. She also argued that the district court erred by failing to address her promissory estoppel claim. On appeal, the court found the Act explicitly exempted from its coverage any data contained in records of the judiciary, Minn. Stat. &sect; 13.90, subd. 2 (1998). Under this exception, once appellant's address became a part of the district court file, the Act no longer governed its disclosure. Appellant failed to present any evidence that elements of promissory estoppel were met.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Under the exception for data of the judiciary, once appellant's address became a part of the district court file, the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act no longer governed its disclosure, improper or otherwise.

Appellant sought review, contending that the evidence was insufficient to support the commitment and that the commitment was unconstitutional.

Subsequently, a jury found defendant guilty of mistreatment of animals by torture or neglect in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 343.21(1) (1998). The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the photographs because the danger of unfair prejudice was not substantially outweighed by their probative value under Minn. R. Evid. 403. The court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to allow defendant to present the additional state-of-mind evidence and in refusing defendant's requested instruction on culpable negligence because there was no language in the statute suggesting that culpable negligence was an element of the offense. As such, the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to reasonably conclude that because of defendant's neglect, dogs in his care did not receive water, and, as a result, dogs unnecessarily suffered and died.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Search warrants for appellant's 2 houses and his person were issued based on information provided by a confidential reliable informant who had made a controlled buy from appellant at one of the houses within the 72 previous hours, and who informed deputies that he had seen several pounds of marijuana at one of the houses within the last 6 months. Nine days later deputies knocked on the door and a female answered it who informed them that appellant was using the phone. A deputy testified that he identified himself to the female, told her that they had a warrant, and that the deputies then entered the house. She testified that the deputies did not identify themselves and that they rushed past her when she turned to get appellant. Evidence was discovered at one house and appellant was convicted of third-degree controlled substance crime. The court affirmed. Appellant cited no authority that the deputies should have waited after their knock had been answered. Because the crime being investigated was ongoing drug sales, it was not unreasonable to conclude that evidence of the crime could still have been present in the home nine days after the controlled buy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction was affirmed. Appellant did not cite authority that search warrant officers needed to wait to enter once they had knocked and the door had been opened.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner and administrator of relators, two nursing homes, did not keep records of his time and attendance for two reporting years. Relators reported the two years' cost of his compensation as $ 256,223. Respondent Minnesota Commissioner of Human Services disallowed the reported cost because of the records' absence, and relators opposed. The administrative law judge (ALJ) recommended applying the &quot;reasoned assumption&quot; statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 256B.48, subd. 3a (1998), and setting the compensation at the average per-bed rate of long-term care administrator compensation for non-metro facilities during the relevant years, which worked out to two years' compensation of $ 78,376. Respondent so adopted, and the court affirmed. ALJ denial of relators' motion to compel discovery of an alleged respondent practice of lump sum settling such matters was not an abuse of discretion. The rule that what was permitted for one nursing home should be permitted for similarly situated ones during the same period did not mean that all facilities that failed to provide cost documentation should be treated equally. Relators did not show they had been treated differently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decision was affirmed. Realtors' owner/administrator's compensation, as cost-reported by relators, had included no documentation, so respondent applied a reasoned assumption per-bed rate instead. Relators made no showing that they had been treated differently than other nursing homes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree assault and fleeing a peace officer in a motor vehicle. Appellant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to modify the self-defense instruction given to the jury, and in admitting testimony regarding recorded telephone communications.

Stat. &sect; 609.245(1), challenged the order from the Hennepin County (Minnesota) District Court which denied his post-conviction motion for a new trial. Appellant claimed that a fellow inmate's confession to the crime was newly discovered evidence, and that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to impeach appellant by his prior convictions if appellant testified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers were stopped by a woman who had just been robbed of her purse at a bus station. Police saw a man running away, followed the man and the one set of footprints in the fresh snow, found the purse with nothing missing, and shortly thereafter found appellant who was breathing hard. Appellant did not testify at trial because the court granted the prosecutor's motion to impeach appellant with his prior convictions if he testified, but he had alibi witnesses. A jury found appellant guilty of aggravated robbery in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.245(1). Appellant filed a motion for a new trial when a fellow inmate confessed to the crime. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court held that because the inmate's confession misstated the facts of the crime, it was incredible, and not likely to change the verdict. Because appellant's prior convictions showed a pattern of lawlessness, and appellant's testimony was not crucial to his case, the trial court did not err in granting the prosecutor's motion to use appellant' prior conviction. The court therefor affirmed the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order; the confession of a fellow inmate, which appellant claimed was newly discovered evidence, was inconsistent with the facts of the robbery, unbelievable, and appellant was likely to be convicted at a new trial. Further, appellant's prior convictions were relevant for impeachment purposes if appellant testified, and were properly allowed as impeachment evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant boater challenged the decision of the district court, which sustained respondent commissioner of public safety's revocation of appellant's driver's license for violating the implied consent law. A deputy stopped appellant's boat after observing appellant's boat travelling at a rate of speed that made a wake in a no-wake zone. Appellant's driver's license was revoked for an alcohol concentration over .10. Appellant challenged the stop of his boat as unconstitutional and claimed his right to counsel was not vindicated. The court affirmed the revocation of appellant's license. The stop of appellant was justified based on articulable suspicion that he violated the no-wake zone. The deputy observed appellant's boat traveling at an inappropriately high rate of speed, and was also notified by a call from dispatch, and by two other people on the lake, that appellant's boat had created a wake. Appellant's limited right to counsel was vindicated because deputy provided appellant a telephone, telephone book, and a reasonable amount of time to contact and speak with an attorney.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Deputy's observation of appellant's boat traveling at an inappropriately high rate of speed, and notification by a call from dispatch, and others on the lake, that appellant's boat had created a wake created articulable suspicion that appellant violated the no-wake zone, and justified the stop of appellant's boat.</SPAN></P>

Respondent Commissioner of Human Services denied relators' requests for reconsideration in separate decisions and, in this consolidated appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court concluded that pertaining to review of DHS matters, Minn.

The court affirmed, finding that the evidence at trial was clear and convincing. Lack of violence was not indicative of appellant's control or lack of control, and appellant's lack of recent misconduct, while in prison, was irrelevant, since all of his victims were female. Both experts at trial testified that appellant had an utter lack of power to control his sexual impulses.

Subsequently, appellant brought a second paternity action against respondent, this time of behalf of the child's mother. Respondent filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds of res judicata and collateral estoppel, based on the prior order. The motion was granted and appellant sought review. Judgment was affirmed because res judicata and collateral estoppel barred a second paternity action brought on behalf of a mother following the dismissal of an earlier paternity action brought on behalf of her child against the same alleged father. When a child was represented in the adjudication of paternity, the adjudication was determinative for all purposes under the Parentage Act, Minn.

The district court denied the motion for temporary injunction and dismissed appellants' claim for failure to state a cause of action. Appellants sought review. Judgment was affirmed because even if appellants could have pursued a private cause of action to enforce the Proxmire Act, they failed to allege a violation of the Act, and because the conjugal visitation policy directly addressed legitimate penological objectives and applied uniformly to all inmates, the prison's policy banning conjugal visits did not violate the United States and Minnesota Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 169.123(4)(c) (1998), the implied consent law, claiming that his conduct did not constitute a refusal, but even if it did, the refusal was reasonable. The record indicated that appellant needed to use the bathroom, but wanted to consult his attorney before deciding whether to submit to a blood or urine test. He gave a urine specimen with the trooper's agreement that it would not be used if he ultimately refused consent. After consulting with his attorney, appellant refused consent and the sample was discarded. Based on these facts, the court affirmed. Only appellant's action in requesting to use the restroom altered the routine processing of his case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city sought to enjoin appellants' continued violation of an ordinance limiting business hours of their bar. In a prior action, a federal judgment declared the ordinance constitutional. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent and issued a permanent injunction. Appellants, arguing that res judicata did not bar a new constitutional challenge to the ordinance, appealed. The court held that a constitutional challenge to enforcement of an ordinance was an affirmative defense and had to be pleaded as such. Because appellants failed to plead the constitutional defense and did not even raise it until after the summary judgment hearing, the district court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of the city. Although the ordinance was declared constitutional, appellants did not abide by the decision and continued violating the ordinance. Therefore, the city's claim involved new facts and circumstances; thus, res judicata did not preclude the district court from granting an injunction.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that his vehicle was stopped without articulable suspicion and that he was seized unlawfully. Appellant also argued that he was deprived of procedural due process by respondent's failure to provide appellant with supplemental reports. The court affirmed the trial court's order. When appellant was stopped, there was only one state trooper and he did not display his weapon or physically contact appellant. Appellant's own actions triggered the trooper's verbal response, which appellant misinterpreted. The record supported the trial court's finding that appellant voluntarily remained at the scene. Because appellant remained voluntarily, there was no seizure. Appellant's attorney found the supplemental report on the morning of the hearing and was able to cross-examine the state trooper on the contents of the supplemental report; therefore, appellant did not present evidence of any direct harm.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed, holding that, even though the officer was a paramedic, he was not a physician, medical technician, physician's trained mobile intensive care paramedic, registered nurse, medical technologist or laboratory assistant, as required by the statute for the protection of the public.

The court held defendant waived the unanimous verdict issue by failing to object to the jury instruction at trial or to raise the issue in a motion for new trial. The general unanimity instruction was sufficient to protect defendant's right to a unanimous verdict because the jury could have found defendant guilty of the crime without agreeing on the precise time and manner of its commission.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of criminal vehicular homicide for striking and killing a pedestrian. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress his blood test results because the officer had the authority to require the test even though defendant refused to consent, and therefore defendant had no right to counsel. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding evidence of the victim's blood alcohol level because it was not a superseding cause of his death and was therefore irrelevant to the jury's consideration of whether the victim's negligence was the proximate cause of his death. The evidence that another driver saw the victim far in advance and that defendant's blood alcohol level was .10 was sufficient to convict him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator appealed the decision of the representative of the Commissioner of Economic Security (Minnesota), denying his application for reemployment benefits, after the representative determined that relator was not eligible to receive benefits because the relator had been terminated for disqualifying misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator was denied reemployment benefits after it was determined that the relator had been terminated for disqualifying misconduct. Relator contended that his conduct did not constitute misconduct as the term was defined in the disqualification statute. Relator contended that his conduct was an isolated &quot;hot-headed&quot; incident and was insufficient to disqualify him for receiving reemployment benefits. However, this was not the type of case to which that rule applied. Relator's conduct was not isolated. He had previously used inappropriate tactics in attempting to advocate for one of the families with whom he was assigned to work. Relator's conduct interfered with his employer's business interest. Relator's violation of the plan demonstrated an intentional and substantial disregard for the employer's interest in maintaining harmonious relationships with the various agencies. Relator's employer was a private employer and not a governmental agency; therefore it could not violate relator's U.S. Const. amend. I rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed; relator's conduct was inappropriate and interfered with his employer's business interests, relator's violation of the plan demonstrated an intentional and substantial disregard for the employer's interest in maintaining harmonious relationships with agencies, and employer was private and could not violate relator's First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state of Minnesota appealed the pretrial order of the Carver County District Court, Minnesota, dismissing charges against respondent of driving after cancellation, gross misdemeanor test refusal, driving while intoxicated, and possession of an open bottle of intoxicating liquor in a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court dismissed a variety of motor vehicle offenses against respondent, concluding that the police officer's two-month-old information that respondent's driver's license had been cancelled was an insufficient basis for the stop. Minnesota case law suggested that an officer need not run a license check before stopping a person on suspicion of driving after suspension of revocation where the officer had a good-faith belief that the driver's license was invalid. The officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that respondent was driving with an invalid license, and the officer was not required to reverify the status of respondent's license. The investigatory stop did not constitute an unlawful arrest. An officer was entitled to &quot;freeze the situation&quot; during an investigatory stop. The evidence of intoxication and the evidence of driving after cancellation were discovered as a result of the stop, not from the additional restraint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed; officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that respondent was driving with an invalid license, and the officer was not required to reverify the status of respondent's license; evidence of intoxication and driving after cancellation were discovered as a result of the stop, not from additional restraint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police were dispatched to appellant's residence on a report of a burglary in progress and received permission to search the house for suspects. Noting evidence of marijuana, police sought permission to search the residence for controlled substances but were denied permission. Officers secured the property while an application and affidavit for a search warrant were drafted. A court issued a search warrant but the address of the premises to be searched was omitted from the search warrant, although it remained in the application and affidavit, and the application and affidavit was not attached to the search warrant. The police executed the warrant and charged appellant with third-degree controlled substance crime. The trial court denied appellant's motion to suppress the evidence and found him guilty of possession with intent to sell marijuana. Appellant argued that denial of his suppression motion was error because the search warrant was invalid. The court upheld his conviction because knowledge of the executing officer limited any serious risk that there would be a search of any premises other than those intended to be searched.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed that the lineup and show-up in which the victim and others identified appellant should have been suppressed because the lineup was unconstitutionally suggestive. The photo lineup used was not impermissibly suggestive. The individuals matched appellant's general description. The record did not support appellant's claim that the lineup was unreliable because police suggested that the perpetrator was in the seventh lineup. Because the show-up merely confirmed the identification made in the photo lineup, any error in admitting the show-up evidence did not warrant the court's considering the issue for the first time on appeal. The evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict as the victim's identification of appellant was never in doubt. Other circumstantial evidence linked appellant to the crime. Although defense counsel made some improper statements, appellant did not meet his burden of proving that without his counsel's errors, the outcome of the trial would have been different.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held appellant responsible for all towing and storage expenses associated with the seizure of his vehicle. On appeal appellant contended the city was responsible for the towing and storage fees. The court held appellant was responsible for the towing and storage expenses because the statute provided a procedure that appellant could have invoked, but did not, to avoid towing and storage expenses while the vehicle forfeiture action was pending.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was a consolidated appeal of three cases in which several trial courts upheld constitutional challenges to Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.123 (1998), the implied consent statute. The State Commissioner of Public Safety disputed that respondents had standing to raise the constitutional challenges. On appeal, the court concluded that respondents did not have standing, and therefore reversed the trial court decisions rescinding the revocation of respondents' driver's licenses. The court held, inter alia, respondents did not have standing to raise a U.S. Const. amend. V challenge because they failed to show that the demand for a statement of facts posed to them the threat of self-incrimination.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for first-degree controlled substance offense and possession of stolen property in Wright County District Court (Minnesota).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant failed to provide an omnibus hearing transcript for his appeal, and so the court could not review the issue of whether he was entitled to an in camera inquiry as to the identity of a witness who provided information in a search warrant application. Appellant failed to show that there was error and resulting prejudice in the admission of witnesses and exhibits which were not on the court ordered pre-trial lists. Appellant did not show that the alleged prosecutorial misconduct prejudiced him. Circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support the jury finding that appellant intended to commit the offenses of which he was found guilty. Appellant first raised his constitutional challenge at the appellate level; there was no reason why justice required consideration of the issue by the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction affirmed; the claimed errors did not provide a basis for reversing appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought rescission of the revocation of his driving licence for driving a snowmobile while intoxicated in an implied-consent proceeding. Appellant disputed the Aitkin County District Court's (Minnesota) refusal to suppress evidence of field sobriety tests and statements made to the arresting officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested on an accusation of driving a snowmobile while intoxicated, and public safety officials subsequently revoked his driver's license. The issue of the case was whether the occupant of a snowmobile, even a passenger, once seized in a lawful stop, could be asked to furnish identification. Appellant was seized when the snowmobile was stopped. Appellant already having been lawfully seized, the request for his driver's license was lawful without further cause being established.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because, having already been lawfully seized, the request for appellant's driver's license was lawful, without further cause being established.</SPAN></P>
